She is married with two sons and two daughters. Amal is a religious woman, so her husband is photographed instead in a FATEN branch. Her husband is an industrial company employee with a decent salary. Amal wants to improve her family life by purchasing new home furniture such as bedroom furniture, living room furniture, etc. The amount of money she has isn't enough to pay for this purchase, so she needs to take out a loan from FATEN. When Amal gets the loan which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to purchase new home furniture and offer her family better living conditions. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nConsuelo operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Celia earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of 13,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nConsuelo dreams to be able to give all her children a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Most of them live in monogamous families in Hamdallaye, one of the working-class neighborhoods of the city of Sikasso (third administrative district of Mali).  This is their first loan with the Soro Yiriwaso micro-finance institution; their goal is to meet their customers' needs.  Aichata is the woman standing in the middle.  Aichata buys and sells oranges.

Solijon, works very hard at ranching. His has his own herd of cattle and works in the field every day to earn a living to support his dear wife and two children. As every business requires investment, Solijon needs some young bulls, which will be raised and sold. For this reason, he turns to IMON International again, to obtain a loan which will allow him to acquire cattle and help him improve the standard of living for his beloved family. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, including a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets-Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities still speaking the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization dating back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R and further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The members manage to support their families through their businesses, and one of their many goals is to provide the best for their families.  \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s hear the testimony of Adr\u00edan, who has been the group\u2019s treasurer for more than two-and-a-half years.  He has been a farmer for over ten years.  His parents gave him some land that he uses to plant alfalfa\u2014this is the crop that he produces the most and gets the most return from, since it is harvested six times a year.  Like all parents, he wants to provide the best for his two children, aged 11 and 6 years old.  He also grows fruits such as apples and quinces along with other crops that include corn, peas, spinach, and potatoes.  He needed a loan in order to purchase seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and herbicides.  He sells his produce to wholesale buyers from the market.  Adr\u00edan and his wife share the expenses of educating their children and providing them with clothes and food.

He also buys battery parts and builds them from scratch.\r\n\r\nHe has gotten several past loans from the foundation through communal banks but this will be his first individual loan.  He is asking for $2.000.000 to buy plates, insulators and battery casings.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to improve his workshop\u2019s location since it is currently in his home and he wants to seal the walls and install new flooring.  Above all, he wants to continue to recycle old batteries for use in many more vehicles so that his market will grow.\r\n\r\nHis greatest challenge, which had a huge impact on him, was when the accident forced him to stop working and he spent all his savings.

Her husband can help her in the purchase of the machine, because the cost is pretty high.\r\nJulia's dream is to have a bread shop in Cartagena where she, her husband, and two of her sons can work; one of them is also a bread maker and the other makes pastries.\r\n\r\nOf the work she has done with Fondo Esperanza, Julia notes that the promotion of the value of the interpersonal relationship between the members of the group has been very important; especially their efforts to share the wisdom of their experiences with the younger members, and to help one another resolve problems.  In terms of business, the most noteworthy part has been the training she and the other communal bank members have received on how to better manage their finances. \r\n\r\nCartagena is a beach community located in central Chile, very close to the port of San Antonio.  The town\u2019s economy depends primarily on tourism, especially in the summer and over holidays, during which many people come from nearby Santiago (Chile's capital).

He does this now taking advantage of the fact that it\u2019s rice harvest time in the area and rice prices decrease during these weeks.  In order to reach this goal, he has asked Edpyme Alternativa for the first time for a loan of 1500 new soles.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is quite a hard working, responsible man.  Where he lives his neighbors and acquaintances consider him to be a level-headed, responsible person.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":571106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy rice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pocitos -

She earns her living by operating a general store business. Her husband Tomas E., who is 48 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn a living, and helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children, who are 15 and  22 years old and currently going to school. \r\n\r\nWilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Wilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 7,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future, to help her husband with their daily needs, to improve her living conditions and to educate the children. \r\n\r\nIn the photo is Wilma and her husband. Wilma E. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

She became a widow six month ago and currently lives with her three children in her own home. After the death of her husband left her indebted, her main economic activity became planting and selling diverse products, and she had to stay strong and work doubly hard on her crops. The land and her efforts bared fruit, and she was able to pay off all of her debts. Since then she has been much more calm and motivated to keep working for the wellbeing of her children, who are still growing. She hopes the older ones can help with the planting. Haydee enjoys cultivating and caring for her plants, especially her peas, because she can harvest them three times with only one planting and that helps her generate very nice earnings. Her goal for the future is to increase her production to be able to purchase more land to cultivate, which will help her earn more money for her children's education.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting cassava for sale.  Richel has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Richel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Richel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from GDMPC.  Richel is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for her child and save the remainder as a reserve for future needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

She is 29 years old. Charibel is the group leader of a 10-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCharibel married and has 1 school-aged child. To make a living, Charibel owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling food products in the local community. Charibel has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Charibel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Charibel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. Charibel is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Charibel from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

working near Red Light, Paynesville. Red Light is Liberia's largest market, a bustling area near the capital (Monrovia) that is full of shops, stalls and vendor tables.\r\n\r\nDaniel is 37 years old and married with five children, aged 7 months to 16 years old. He also cares for two of his wife's aunt's daughters. Daniel is a high school graduate and went on to university but had to stop his studies after the first year due to a lack of money to pay school fees.\r\n\r\nDaniel\u2019s business is selling kerosene. He buys wholesale in 55-gallon drums and then sells gallons of kerosene to his customers. Most of his customers are from rural areas and use the kerosene for lanterns and cooking.\r\n\r\nDaniel's share of this 27,000 Liberian dollar group loan is 6,000 Liberian dollars. He intends to buy more kerosene with the money from the loan.\r\n\r\nDaniel has been running his business for five years and this is his first loan from Kiva field partner LEAP. Daniel says the key to his success has been talking to customers in a good manner and sometimes he adds bonuses to their purchases to reward them. His dream is to own a gas station someday.\r\n\r\nIf he makes good profits from his business, Daniel hopes to be able to educate his children as fully as possible, send his wife to school and complete his own university education.

Gordiano has, over years, been operating a cattle fattening farm in Mpundo, Ibanda. He sells cows to earn a living, from the periodic markets that take place around the area in western Uganda. In this business he directly purchases the livestock and then raises them for some time on his farm. When the livestock is ready for market, he supplies to butchers, hotels and other customers in the periodic market. \r\n\r\nHis main drawback in the course of doing this business has been the unstable price on the market and low capital input.

She joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Pedra has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 13,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 12,000 PHP, thus lifting her family's standard of living. \r\n<p>\r\nThis time, for her fifth loan cycle she is borrowing 13,000 PHP which she intends to use to purchase more fishing tackle so that she can continue to save up for the future and business expansion.

In spite of the constant problems he has faced, he has not been discouraged.  On the contrary, he works hard to get ahead in life.  He lives in his own home which is located in the town of Huaycha.  One year ago his mother, who was his only companion, died.  In spite of this, he continues working without rest as he would like to get ahead and achieve his goals.  He started sowing potatoes, corn and fodder on his four plots of farmland four years ago.  What he most enjoys about his work is having to take wise and important decisions such as when pests ruin his crops and he needs to care for and clean his crops all day long. \"I learned this from my mother\", he comments.  In addition, Percy is well known among the traders in the city of Huancayo where he sells his harvests.  He is a responsible man with many ambitions and he also raises cows.  He has three good-quality cows and he hopes to increase the size of his herd as he would like to start producing dairy products in bulk.  At the same time, he also works as a builder, building houses which makes him extra money.\r\n\r\nPercy is a member of the 'San Miguel' community bank and this is his seventh loan from MFP.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Philippine pesos (PHP)-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan for 50,000 PHP. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNoime hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all of her hard work on her business.

Because her home city of Ayacucho, Per\u00fa is located rather remotely in the Andes Mountains, it is difficult to find a variety of clothing and jewelry. For this reason, Iris makes the monthly ten hour bus trip to the capital city of Lima to buy beautiful clothing and jewelry which she carries home to Ayacucho and sells to friends, family, and customers. Much of the time she receives orders, for example for a summer sundress, and with this direction she uses her good taste to pick out a nice outfit. \r\n\r\nIris has been involved in this business for the past 10 years, and is very content. The way she currently does business allows her much freedom and the ability her to travel, an aspect she loves. She is currently entering the busiest time of year. In Ayacucho, at the end of the school year (which is in January), there are many graduation parties. From those completing primary school to high school graduations, families celebrate this happy occasion. A staple of these parties is the perfect graduation dress. Beginning in December, orders begin pouring to Iris from mothers wanting the perfect graduation dress for their daughters. Thus, Iris is planning a special weeklong trip to Lima in December, when she will buy many dresses to bring back to Ayacucho. An economic boost in the form of a small loan is what makes projects such as this possible for Iris. It is also what has made the support of her family of four daughters possible. Without such loans, the growth and success of her small enterprising business would be nearly impossible. This is why Iris loves her village bank. It is there that she receives advice on everything from saving her money to how to better support her family. Iris is currently requesting a loan of $1025 in order to fill the many orders pouring in for the holiday and graduation season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":94284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy dresses, jewelry, and gifts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-12-07T22:15:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Iris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-22T03:44:34Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2008-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2008-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2008-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":257,"local_amount":752.2,"processed_date":"2008-01-22T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":767.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":120122},{"amount":257,"local_amount":752.2,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":767.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140285},{"amount":257,"local_amount":752.2,"processed_date":"2008-03-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":767.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":163854},{"amount":254,"local_amount":743.41,"processed_date":"2008-04-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":758.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188843}],"funded_date":"2007-12-08T03:44:34Z","paid_date":"2008-04-22T09:10:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":30815,"name":"Naziran's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"I live in the small town of Kot Radha Kishan, Pakistan, with my family.

Having a common goal for the family is a grace. This is the experience of the L. family. Jessie, who is 54 years old, is married to Renato  and lives in the village of Purok 2, Barangay Carabalan, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.  Their children, the oldest of whom is 27, and the youngest 12, live with them.\r\n\r\nShe already had a cafeteria beside her house years before she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon. It was not much but it helped defray their daily expenses and the education of their children. But it was only after she became a PD member in 2002 that her business expanded. Pouring in more capital to her cafeteria resulted in higher returns, and as she paid off the loans in each cycle, she was able to access even bigger loans because of her good track record of paying on time. Later she decided to turn over the management of the cafeteria to her husband and she set up a vegetable stand in the market to earn additional income. This new arrangement proved to be a wise decision for the couple as their family income grew. She has even started selling household commodities in addition to vegetables to provide her customers with variety. The vegetable stand nets an average monthly income of PHP 4,000 and pays for the education of her children and provides savings. From her earnings, she was able to buy a motorcycle to use in her business.\r\n\r\nOver the years, she's kept a her good credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon. On her previous loan, her 21st loan cycle, she borrowed PHP 25,000 and put it all into her business and fully paid on time without any delays. And for her 22nd cycle she borrowed PHP 26,000 which she intends to use to purchase larger quantities of vegetables and spices to boost her earning capacity. She is planning to invest her income from this cycle to go into the pig-fattening business and also to add to the capital of the cafeteria.  The balance will be used for house repair.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":396608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional vegetables and spices.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Binalbagan, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-10-02T02:50:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.24},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":221.15,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":10441.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004165},{"amount":176.93,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":8353.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848936},{"amount":176.92,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:59:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8353.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739604}],"funded_date":"2009-10-02T19:49:52Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:59:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stacy Beard","image":316373}},{"id":145622,"name":"Nelith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nelith es una mujer colaboradora y alegre, vive en la ciudad de Pucallpa, regi\u00f3n de Ucayali, tiene 39 a\u00f1os y es madre de un adolescente, se dedica a la venta de abarrotes en general, pues cuenta con una bodega que funciona en su casa, cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo que se dedica a la venta de madera.

Their two elder sons help the parents look after the cattle. So Jyparkul and her husband do not have any difficulties looking after that many cattle. Their monthly income from trading in livestock is up to $230. This is a good income. Jyparkul decided to apply for a loan to purchase seven or eight sheep and a calf.

M. is 43 years old and the owner of the Villa Concorde Restaurant, which is located in the Concord neighborhood in the city of Malambo.  This area is part of the metropolitan section of Barranquilla.  She is requesting a loan in the amount of 1,500,000 COP in order to buy an industrial stove, two sets of tables and chairs, a set of cookware, copper pots, and groceries.\r\n<p>\r\nShe started this business nine years ago when she was pregnant with her youngest child.  Carmen decided to sell soup from home so that she could help her husband, who at the time managed a vending stall at the market in Barranquilla.  Two years later, she joined the Foundation and acquired her first loan.  During the years of working with the Foundation, Carmen transformed her informal business into one that is more organized.  She first equipped her business when she started it in her home, but then she legalized her operation and moved it into a separate location away from her house.  Carmen only sold soup at first, but that was the basis for selling traditional Colombian-Caribbean dishes that her customers usually buy already prepared.  Despite there being other establishments that sold soup, there were plenty of customers for all of her other dishes.  She has been selling complete lunches for four years and now has tables and chairs at her establishment.\r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest problem at the moment is that she has been overly indebted for some time so that she could acquire a motorcycle taxi for her husband.  He was not generating income at the time so they were having momentary difficulties.  From that experience, Carmen learned that while it is important to set goals, one should not try to do everything at once.  Instead, it is best to have a well-designed plan.  She is now waiting for her 17 year old daughter to finish her education so that she can pursue a nursing career.  Carmen also dreams of providing a college education for her 8 year old son.  She hopes to continue improving her business and this loan will help gain more customers.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nReynaldo is married and has 2 children. To make a living, Reynaldo owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Reynaldo has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP whenever he sells his raised animal.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Reynaldo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Reynaldo is requesting a loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the first loan taken out by Reynaldo from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She owns a business venture planting and harvesting taro for sale and has many years of experience in this business.\r\n\r\nLematea needs a loan of WST 750 to purchase weedkillers such as Gramoxone. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or approximately USD 193 per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lematea joined SPBD and this is her 3rd loan with the organization. SPBD's loans are her only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and, since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join  SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates about

She is married to a driver, Jaime, and mothers her three children who are still studying now. Together, they live in Brgy. Commonwealth, Quezno City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nWilhelmina runs her own sari-sari (variety) store located in the extension of their house. Everyday she observes the buying patterns of her customers and notes down their preferences in terms of the type of item they buy, the price, and the brand. She sees to it that her customers get what they deserve. Monthly, Wilhelmina earns Php11,000 on average.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business she is requesting a 8,000 PHP loan. She intends to meet the demands of her customers. As needed, she will buy more stocks of rice, soft drinks, and other grocery items. \r\n\r\nWilhelmina acknowledges that no challenges are too hard to deal with. She knows that the Lord will enable her to overcome and uphold the future of both her children and her business. She dreams of making her sari-sari store to grow.

In any case, on the weekends she also, apart from selling her tamales and attending to her grocery store, prepares typical platters to also sell at the store.  <p>\r\n\r\nShe only lives with her husband and grandson of 10 years of age, whom they take care of and support.  Rosario says that she doesn't receive any allowance from her son to take care of her grandson so she dedicates the money that she receives from renting a room in her house for his expenses.

Y hoy ya hace veinticinco a\u00f1os que Rosario se encarga de manejarla, de atender y de hacerla crecer. <p>Por otro lado, Rosario y su esposo quien ya e jubilado por trabajar en una f\u00e1brica de bebidas gasificadas, preparan alrededor de 200 tamales los fines de semana para venderlos amigos y familiares. Gracias a esto, la saz\u00f3n de Rosario se ha hecho conocida y frecuentemente recibe pedidos de tamales para algunos eventos o fiestas.  De todos modos, ella los fines de semana a parte de vender sus tamales y de atender en su bodega, prepara algunos platos t\u00edpicos y los vende en su bodega tambi\u00e9n.<p>\r\nElla vive \u00fanicamente con su esposo y con su nieto de diez a\u00f1os, a quien cuida y mantiene tambi\u00e9n. Rosario cuenta que no recibe ninguna pensi\u00f3n de su hijo para el cuidado de su nieto es as\u00ed que destina el dinero que recibe por el alquiler de una habitaci\u00f3n en su casa para los gastos de \u00e9l.\r\nM\u00e1s adelante ella desear\u00eda convertir su bodega en un bazar pues lo considera m\u00e1s rentable."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":155797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buying merchandise to supply her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Comas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2008-05-13T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-27T20:06:15Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-06-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-27T09:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250484},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-07-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-27T09:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":279100},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-08-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-27T09:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308653}],"funded_date":"2008-05-13T20:06:15Z","paid_date":"2008-08-27T09:25:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":51315,"name":"Kudirat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kudirat S. sells foodstuffs at Iba Community located at the northern part of Lagos State, Nigeria.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

living in Smaong village in Takeo province, is requesting a loan. Mrs. Srey Roth K. is the village bank president who has been selected by the members. She is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate rice. In this plantation she faces an obstacle because her field has infertile soil which badly affects her crop. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to support the field. Her husband, Mr.  Ev Mei, is a driver who gets little salary. Mrs. Srey Roth K. is 30 years old and the mother of three children, one of whom stays at home while another attends the local school.  The youngest one is too young to work or study. \r\n<p>\r\nFive members in this group have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":389298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to support the field.

B. is a 39-year-old mother of two who lives in San Jose, located in the central valley of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nIrene has worked in sales over the past ten years. She is a busy entrepreneur who earns a living by selling various products including shoes, catalogue products, jewelry, perfumes and cosmetics. Irene\u2019s goal is to expand her shoe selling business; she plans to use this loan to increase her shoe inventory.\r\n\r\nIrene makes sales over the phone and by visiting individual clients in her community. She also sells products to her children\u00b4s teachers and other members of her community. Through word of mouth, her client base has grown. Irene\u00b4s goal is to have her own store where she would be able to sell various products in order to maintain her diverse client base.\r\n\r\nA main obstacle for Irene is economic and she says she could double her sales with more working capital. She hopes that this loan will help accomplish just that. Another challenge has been clients who are late on payments or refuse to pay. To overcome this obstacle, she has created flexible payment schedules for some of her clients. For example, instead of one payment, a client is allowed to make a number of smaller payments.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Irene is taking guitar lessons and hopes that this activity will one day become a source of income. She says that she is happy places like Fundacion Mujer exist - organizations that support small businesses like hers. The loan process has been a large step up for Irene. It has opened doors and opportunities for her and her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":493821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy more shoes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"San Jos\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-02-23T19:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":19239.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":19560.04},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":19886.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20217.47},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20554.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20897.01},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":21245.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":21599.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":21959.37},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":22325.36},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":22697.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":23075.74},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":23460.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":23851.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":24248.86},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":24653.01},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25063.89},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25465.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.87},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.26},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.51},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.46},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.14},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.83},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.52},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.23},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.95},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":34.87,"local_amount":19239.38,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":19308.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913489},{"amount":35.45,"local_amount":19560.04,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":19630.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136678097},{"amount":33.91,"local_amount":18707.1,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:14Z","rounded_local_amount":18774.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712570},{"amount":38.91,"local_amount":21464.94,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":21541.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152047929},{"amount":5.16,"local_amount":2848.1,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2858.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411538},{"amount":25.55,"local_amount":14097.11,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":14147.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148737},{"amount":551.15,"local_amount":304083,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":305172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315614313}],"funded_date":"2010-02-24T03:08:27Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":183260,"name":"Blanca Estrella Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este banco comunal es llamado \u201cBlanca Estrella\u201d y est\u00e1 conformado por 15 socios, pertenecientes a la ciudad de Talca.

","en":"Raymunda, who is 46 years old, lives with her husband Guillermo (46) and their 6 children, together in their own house. A long time ago, Raymunda worked for a coffee grower, and received a good wage, but her ideas were not taken into account. After some years she ventured into agricultural activities, specifically the production and marketing of coffee, coca and cocoa. This allows her to make her own decisions, and since then she has had good results. In addition, her customer base is growing, and consequently her income is stable. This is due to her constant work, along with her partner, and the support of their workers. Usually she sells her cocoa, coffee and coca to merchants. She works Monday to Saturday, from 7 in the morning to 6 in the evening. Her plan for the future is to continue betting on agriculture, and she wants to buy more farmland with the intent of increasing her agricultural production. This is her first loan with MFP, and she pledges to meet her repayment obligations. She feels empowered by her communal bank, since its members have given her a lot of help. Raymunda plans to invest the requested money in maintaining her farm products with the purchase of manure and fertilizers, and in this way she hopes to continue her progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":692720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase manure and fertilizers to improve her crops ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-14T21:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raymunda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1045.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850544}],"funded_date":"2011-01-15T16:14:38Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Melbourne","image":762140}},{"id":269324,"name":"Marlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marlita C. is from the town of Sta.

Irene still lives with her mother in a three-room house. The death of her fianc\u00e9 made  her confused in life since he was planning to let her further her education. Due to poverty her parents were unable to send her to school nor make her learn a trade. All this made her join GHAPE in 2008. She took her first loan which she invested in the rearing of fowls and buying and selling of used shoes. She also assists her mother in frying and selling puff-puff (fritters) and beans.\r\n\r\nGiven another loan, she plans to buy more used shoes to resell from one local market to another. Most of the people in her community are poor and cannot afford new shoes so most of them buy only used shoes. She also plans to rear fowls with part of the loan as fowls are a fast income-generating activity because they don\u2019t take a long time to mature.\r\n\r\nThe profit she gets from the loan shall be used to expand her business by growing fowls on a larger scale in order to satisfy more people. Part of the profit will also be used to educate her child and her nieces and nephews. \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community in its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":768451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy used shoes and raise pigs and fowls.

She reserves the product with a down payment and the balance is given in payments, and in this manner she makes more profit, and in this same way they have begun to request clothing and other products. This is how she decided to open a store in her own home, and then began to travel to Trujillo because they would request good quality shoes. Little by little she gained more clients and her business prospered a lot. Unfortunately, when her daughter became ill she had to leave the business and dedicate herself to her family. After some time she has returned to the business but only in-home sales and it is going well because her clients are OK with that. With her income she has achieved economic stabilty as well as being able to help her husband with the construction of their own home.\r\n\r\nIn the future Yesenia would like to have a restaurant that serves traditional food; she has taken a course to be a chef and would like to serve as one. It is for this reason that she is saving money because she wishes to buy an adequate piece of land where she can build her restaurant. She and 8 partners are members of the group \u201cYHIRET\u201d. She has been with EDAPROSPO for close to 4 years and is happy with the support that she has received from this entity. Now she will use her loan in order to buy clothes and sneakers since she already has orders to fulfill.

She owns a business venture, selling local Samoan snacks such as palusami (coconut cream wrapped in taro leaves), cooked taro, yams, and soupo ese (hearty papaya soup). Tuamasaga has 3 years of experience in this business. Tuamasaga needs a loan of WST$1500 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tuamasaga joined SPBD. This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tuamasaga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD, and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is what Sarah M., a CCT* community partner, keeps in mind as she faces daily challenges in life owing to the fact that she reached only the third year in high school. Sarah, 61, is married to Wilfredo, a hotel driver. Together, they have raised four children, of whom one is studying while the other three are already working.  They live now in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nSarah manages a \"carinderia\" (food stall) at her home. Every day she wakes up to cook and serve delicious, healthy meals to people in their neighborhood. She also employs two helpers to assist her in the daily operation of the \"carinderia\". Monthly, she earns at least Php 7,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Sarah would like to apply for a Php 10,000 loan, which she will use to make sure the \"carinderia\" is in good shape to better serve the customers. She plans to buy ingredients of quality and in large quantity to gain a reputation for excellent service. Sarah dreams of expanding the \"carinderia\" and putting up her own store.\r\n\r\nTough, complaining customers challenge Sarah as well as customers who do not pay their debts on time.

is a hard working businessman. He is 43 years old and married with two kids. He sells bananas and fresh eggs. He buys his supplies from Volta in the south eastern part of Ghana and from poultry farms around Tema. He enjoys his trade very much but the prices of his commodities and transport have gone up due to the current fuel crisis. This has rendered his capital inadequate so he can't purchase appreciable quantities to sell. He therefore needs the loan to inject additional capital into his business so he meet the demands of the market.
