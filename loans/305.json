She is married and has 3 children. All of her children are currently in school. Mary has a business selling matooke (green plaintain), which she has had for 2 years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mary has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more matooke.  With this loan from BRAC, Mary hopes to generate greater profits and to pay school fees. In the future, Mary hopes to own another business like charcoal sales. Mary is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by learning how to deal with customers through financial literacy training. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n

She lives in her own home with her husband Oscar, 29, and she works with him on a farm.  Together, they want to provide a better life for their beloved son, Aldair.  Working arduously each day in their fields, Marcela is changing their lives.  With her husband she plants beans, corn, and gladioli, which they sell in the markets of Tarma and La Merced, since this is where they can obtain the best prices.  What she likes most about her work is to care for the plantings so that they remain free of diseases and pests.  She has been doing this work for 19 years, and what she considers most difficult is to take her products to the markets where they are sold, since she must carry sacks that are very heavy.  In the future, she hopes to improve her crops and in this way obtain better prices.

Her father was a fisherman and her mother sold fish.\r\n\r\nEach time the river rose they had to leave their home because it would end up under water.  Back then there was still no retaining wall.  Isabel could only study up to her third year of secondary education because when she was 15 her father abandoned the family and, as the eldest daughter, she had to work to help her mom raise her siblings.\r\n\r\nMaria Isabel started working as a cleaner.  At the age of 19 she had her first child and had to go and work on a farm stay as a cook in order to be able to raise her child.\r\n\r\nIsabel currently lives in San Francisco neighborhood, in the city of Concepci\u00f3n with her partner, 32 year-old Carlos Alberto, who works as an assistant chainsaw operator.  They have two children: 15 year-old Daysi and 8 year-old Jos\u00e9 Miguel.  She currently works selling clothes and shoes.\r\n\r\nIsabel is a member of the 'Grupo Unidas' committee which has 19 members who all want to escape the poverty that they live in with their families.  However, in order to achieve this they need the financial help of Kiva through Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya.  They are requesting this loan so that they can make progress, make more income and enjoy a better quality of life.  Isabel will invest her loan in buying clothes and shoes for resale, bearing in mind that purchasing goods in large quantities reduces costs and increases

She is married and has three children. She enjoys her work of fattening up livestock. This trade has a lot of obstacles and difficulties, because the livestock might fall ill if they are not vaccinated in time, or given other necessary medicine. If they are badly taken care of and poorly fed, the livestock might lose weight and not produce offspring. Thus her husband and son help her with the business. \r\n\r\nRaqiba is a positive woman, and she has a large and amiable family. Raqiba has to work a lot in order to support her family. She works in animal husbandry and milk processing. Her husband helps her with this business. They spend the income received from raising cattle and selling milk on their family, and some goes to helping their elderly parents. \r\n\r\nRaqiba wants to give her children a good education. This is her dream, since she herself was unable to receive a good education. In order to make her dreams a reality, she must work even more and augment her business. In order to increase her herd she needs a small sum of money. Raqiba has previously taken a loan from Arvand, and since the service and conditions for granting the loan in this bank are satisfying to her demands, she has decided to once again apply to Arvand. Now she has applied to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to buy livestock. She is hoping very much for support."}},"status":"issue","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2025964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raqiba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":435.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":455.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":443.45},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":494.27},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":492.07},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":505.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":512.01},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":531.77},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":529.63},{"due_date":"2016-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":564.59},{"due_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":574.53},{"due_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":581.82},{"due_date":"2016-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":608.35},{"due_date":"2017-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":618.08},{"due_date":"2017-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":634.88},{"due_date":"2017-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":657.44},{"due_date":"2017-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":670},{"due_date":"2017-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":691.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.32},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.14},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.81},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.75},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.8},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.77},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.44},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.69},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.18},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.27},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.25},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.71},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.23},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.62},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.5},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cheryl Tan","image":null}},{"id":991755,"name":"Jesus Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Jes\u00fas Elizabeth con 32 a\u00f1os, de estado civil madre soltera,vive en casa propia, junto a sus hijos, en el distrito de Lagunas,provincia de Chiclayo,departamento de Lambayeque,pa\u00eds Per\u00fa.

The reality of their lives makes  any woman who wants to improve the quality of life for her family a real fighter.   This group of women maintains the customs and traditions of Cerro de Oro.   As you see in the photos, all of the women wear a traditional skirt with great pride, and most wear the traditional blouse.   The mother tongue for these women is Maya Tzutujil, but many of them speak Spanish well.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the women work in textiles.  Half of them used their loan to buy thread for making the traditional skirts.  These skirts are the same as you see in the photos.  The other half used the money to buy clothing to resell.  Several of the women earn money buying and selling American style clothing, while others sell the traditional clothing.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the nice characteristics of this group is that the loan obligations are shared.  They are all requesting similar amounts of money, and they are growing their businesses at the same time.   This helps make it a cohesive group, as the women feel they are all more or less at the same level.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The women feel that it's important to work with the methodology of the communal banks, because other forms of credit wouldn't be available to them.  The majority of them don't have much to use as collateral, so the loans via communal banks work well for them. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>These women share the dream of improving the quality of life for their families.  The situation in which they live is not ideal for the optimal development of their children, as the community lacks good services.    This is why through Kiva, we can help these women realize their dreams and continue to help their families.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/p> Translated by Kiva volunteer Emily Charnes <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres del grupo Flor del Cerro 2 son unas personas emprendedoras. La realidad en la que viven las mujeres en Cerro de Oro hace a cualquier mujer que quiere salir adelante junto con su familia una verdadera luchadora. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de se\u00f1oras mantienen las costumbres tradicionales de Cerro de Oro. Como se puede ver en la foto todas las se\u00f1oras lucen su corte, o falda tradicional, con mucho orgullo, y todas excepto una lucen sus m\u00e1gicos huipiles o blusas. La lengua materna de estas mujeres es el Maya Tzutujil, sin embargo algunas tienen la facilidad de desenvolverse bien en el idioma espa\u00f1ol. \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las se\u00f1oras trabajan en el \u00e1rea textil. La mitad de ellas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en la compra de hilo para elaborar los huipiles tradicionales de Cerro de Oro. Estos huipiles se asemejan a los que ellas mismas lucen en la foto. La otra mitad de se\u00f1oras invierten su cr\u00e9dito en la compra de ropa para su reventa. Algunas de ellas trabajan comprando y vendiendo ropa americana, mientras que otras revenden ropa tradicional. \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Una de las buenas caracter\u00edsticas de este grupo es que en general el rango de pr\u00e9stamos es reducido. Las mujeres est\u00e1n sacando una cantidad de dinero similar. Esto implica que las mujeres se est\u00e1n desarrollando empresarialmente al mismo tiempo. Este rasgo ayuda a la cohesi\u00f3n del grupo, ya que las mujeres sienten que todas est\u00e1n al mismo nivel. \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Las se\u00f1oras sienten que es realmente importante trabajar bajo la metodolog\u00eda de bancos comunales porque de otra forma ellas no podr\u00edan acceder a un cr\u00e9dito. La mayor\u00eda de ellas no tienen muchas pertenencias o escrituras que pueden dejar como colateral, es por eso que trabajar bajo esta metodolog\u00eda se les hace muy conveniente. \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>El sue\u00f1o de estas mujeres es el de sacar a sus familias adelante. La situaci\u00f3n en la que viven estas mujeres no es ideal para el \u00f3ptimo desarrollo de sus hijos e hijas debido a la falta de buenos servicios en la comunidad. Es por eso que nosotros por medio de Kiva, las tenemos que ayudar para que ellas as\u00ed puedan cumplir su sue\u00f1o, sacar a su familia adelante."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":157527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

His wife works as a teacher in a secondary school. Domullo has been working as a traffic cop for twelve years, but has retired early due to worsened health. His pension is not enough to cover life expenses and this is why he decided to start a business by raising and reselling cattle. He is familiar with this business and has done it before, but now he is fully devoting his time to cattle. His health has improved a great deal and he is ready to continue his work. To increase the working capital he decided to get a loan. His wife is pictured here because Domullo himself was not present during the screening session. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":301547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-11T06:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":612.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000834},{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:22:02Z","rounded_local_amount":612.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846211},{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":612.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110737312},{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":612.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118127043},{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":612.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123964053}],"funded_date":"2009-04-19T19:04:20Z","paid_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":105018,"name":"Sem's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This small loan group is formed by two borrowers and Mr. Sem V., aged 30, is the group leader.

She is married and has four school-aged children.  To make a living, Ni Wayan Suweli owns & operates a general store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Ni Wayan Suweli has been engaged in this business for over seven years and earns approximately 750,000 IDR a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Ni Wayan Suweli joined DINARI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

They are the reason she puts forth so much effort to succeed.  Her business is located in one of the most central parks in the city of Juliaca.  Her snack stand is one of the busiest, given that it is well stocked and people know that they will find what they are looking for there.  This has made her business very profitable, and motivates her to dedicate herself fully to it.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her work is chatting with her customers, as this helps ease the burden of all the long workdays.  She has been carrying out this activity for 2 years, and she considers the most challenging aspect of her business to be at her stall all day long without pause.  Over time, she hopes to rent a site in the same area where she could provide a higher level of service to her patrons.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan that Lucia has accessed with MFP, and she knows that the funds will help her improve her future prospects.  However, she also knows she must make her payments on time in order to not create any problems for her cooperative bank.

Her other 4 children are adults and are already independent.\r\n\r\nOne year ago she set up a small food store in a room of her house, since in the neighborhood where she lives there is no competition.

Susana likes her work very much, since it is quiet and she can interact with her neighbors and acquaintances.  She currently sells a little bit of everything, from basic necessities to soft drinks and beer, which she sells a lot of during the weekends.\r\n\r\nAnd, being a hardworking woman, she has plans for the future to expand the facilities of her store and put in some tables and chairs for the comfort of her customers when they want something to drink.\r\n\r\nThis is her 13th loan with MFP and she is very grateful to all of the people who have made her loan possible so that she can continue working to get ahead.  At the same time she is very content with the work of her group because it is made up of people who are very responsible and punctual in their payments.  Susana plans to use the money she now requests to buy a greater quantity of merchandise for her store, since she wants to restock it with a greater variety of products to offer the best to her

This association was founded in 1993 by twenty women entrepreneurs to increase their purchasing power by way of a tontine (a revolving credit system in which each member periodically pays a suitable amount and which funds its various members by turns). This policy does not allow every member to be financed on the same day. \r\n\r\nThe members decided to join IMCEC in order to award loans without guarantee requirements. Thus, the members are divided into sub-groups of five, each with a designated president and a treasurer. These sub-groups, which are called Takku Liggey in the Medina Fall branch, can be the same for several years but often change their members according to the financing of needs and other considerations. \r\n\r\nThe AFDE organizes member meetings each month, when all the sub-groups and branches are invited. It facilitates cooperation for its members, enabling them to buy rice and other goods at better prices. The AFDE is lead by a president by the name of Ms. Mame Diarra MAR and by a treasurer, Ms. Ndeye Ndella Diouf , both residents of Thi\u00e8s.\r\n\r\nThus, the sub-group Takky Liggey n\u00b0 30 regroups five women in the same business. They sell charcoal and firewood under the control of the Water Affairs and Forestry department to avoid contributing (as they say) to the degradation of nature. This loan allows them to develop their activity and reinforce solidarity through their group deposit. The sub-group is led by Ms. Tabara Tiagne, 50 years old and mother of seven children. This lady knows the business and has an accumulated six years\u2019 experience. She is joined in this group by the Treasurer Ms. Anta Gu\u00e8ne, Ms. Ndeye Ndella L., Ms. Ouzine L. and Ms. Khady B..\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva

She is a single mother with 2 children who are reliant on her: 11 year-old Roberto Mario, who they call Tito, and Linda Patricia (Pati), who is 6. And the baby who will be born in a few months will be a girl, and she is eager to hold her in her arms. \r\nShe has been an elementary school teacher for 11 years. She teaches in a community called Madero, which is some distance from where she lives. But she is still doing well and has been able to help her family get ahead. People treat her well thanks to the service that she gives to her students and they don't want her to leave her work for any reason because she is a good person.\r\nShe says that she requested a loan to buy materials for her craft production, being: thread, rings, wood, and needles to make hammocks, bags, landscape pictures, and swings. She has been doing this work for 10 months and says that it is going well as her customers buy in bulk and she gives them payment schemes.  \r\nWith the income that she makes from her sales, she buys more material so she can make more crafts, and every day she has more income and will be able to repay the loan that she is requesting from Fundac\u00edon Realidad and the loan will give her better work opportunities. \r\nShe wants to be able to save so that in time she can build a larger house and make her children comfortable. She also wants to have a stationary store where she can sell high-quality goods. She wants this so her children can have a good education and good future.  \r\nMacarena became part of the group when her friend, Flor Delva, who is the group's representative for the loan, invited her. She was interested because the loan payments are easy and the interest is low, so she joined. The group is called \"Ori\u00f3n\" because where they work there is a street of that name. \r\nThere are 4 women in the group and each has a different business, being:\r\nMacarena will use the loan to buy materials to make crafts such as hammocks, swings, pictures, and bags. \r\nFlor Delva will use the loan to buy and sell shoes, sandals, and women's bags.\r\nMar\u00eda Elid\u00eda will use the loan to buy catalogs to sell shoes from the Impulso and Maga brands.\r\nAdalia will use the loan to buy catalogs from Fuller, Jafra, and Blondy to sell perfumes, deodorants, and other goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva

He lives in the municipality of Malambo, where he raises chickens and pigs. He learned this business more than 12 years ago, thanks to the fact that he always accompanied his father when he was transporting feed for a business that raised and sold chickens. Thus, together with his brothers, he began with 10 poultry sheds in the yard of his house and 100 chickens. As the business grew, he achieved commercial successes such as becoming registered as a supplier for a state enterprise. However, with these achievements also came great challenges: for instance, there were problems with electricity and water in his poultry sheds and he suffered some losses. Because of this, three years ago Alfredo decided to move his business with the help of a family member, relocating it to a lane with all of the necessary conditions to raise animals appropriately. This made his work easier, and now he is more at ease and enthusiastic about increasing the productivity of his business. He has joined with the National Learning Service, SENA, where he participates in a community project providing technical consulting for raising and fattening animals. His loan with Kiva is the first with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and he needs it to buy 500 chickens, 9 packages of concentrated feed, 65 laying hens, and 10 pigs. This will allow him to increase his working capital and expand his commercial coverage to 1000 chickens, in order to increase his income.

This will be her 6th loan with MFP. She needs a lot of help to achieve her goals. Lida loves to work with her village bank because they are people who are always around her and share the same ideals. With the loan money, Lida will be able to buy manure for her coffee and plantain crops, which costs 120 soles per bag.

Homero is titled the El Paso Business Coach. This is a name his son titled him with to bring in more business. H. Homero said he has witnessed small businesses struggle, stay small, and sometimes, flop. This encouraged him to begin The Ascend: Entrepreneurial Growth. The company is almost three years old now. H. Homero noticed a need to build a stronger economy and stop the cost of business. \u201cWe won\u2019t build our economy if we don\u2019t build ourselves,\u201d he stated. The Ascend: Entrepreneurial Growth assists in coaching small businesses on maturity, building infrastructure and creating a system to ensure a business works as an organization.\r\n\r\nThrough his business, H. Homero offers a workshop at no cost to local business owners entitled: \u201cBlueprint for Business Growth.\u201d He, as well, has others that he charges for. H. Homero\u2019s main advantage is the offered one-on-one coaching of his clients and reasonable price compared to major franchise groups. Since he offers the one-on-one coaching, H. Homero\u2019s assistance is client-limited. Because of this, he works with anywhere from a dozen to 20 clients annually. \r\n\r\nThe current hindrance for H. Homero\u2019s business is his marketing presence. H. Homero stressed the complications of working with minor businesses. He said, \u201cThe trick is to bring (his coaching) to those who can\u2019t afford it.\u201d H. Homero expressed that he would love to decrease his prices for those who want and need his help, but at the moment, he cannot afford to do so. H. Homero requested the loan to purchase office equipment and market his business. His primary goal for The Ascend: Entrepreneurial Growth has not been as dramatically accomplished as he expected, he said, however the loan from ACCION Texas has helped. A returning client, H. Homero said one of things that happens as a small business is that projects and advancements such as purchasing software or other supplies are put off until capital is earned, which in turn, holds the business process. \u201cThe loan helps me grow the business now,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nH. Homero\u2019s work involves educating other entrepreneurs. He said the company is trying to break ground and bring people to his office. As he noticed, other businesses are using their profit to pay franchised business coaches to teach them rudimentary skills they really do not need to pay for. He added: 89 percent of small business owners are sole proprietors leaving that one person to cover every expense and find solutions to every problem, something he is familiar with. H. Homero is also a sole proprietor of his business who sometimes collaborates with other successful business owners. He, too, has learned about small business and entrepreneurship by conducting first-hand interviews with now household names of different industries. \r\nTo find out more about H. Homero and his business, visit his website at: http:\/\/www.ascendeg.com.

The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":126494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more kitchen utensils and food to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-02-11T16:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tully","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-25T20:03:34Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59,"local_amount":67428.57,"processed_date":"2008-03-25T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":69118.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":165953},{"amount":59,"local_amount":67428.57,"processed_date":"2008-04-25T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":69118.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191737},{"amount":59,"local_amount":67428.57,"processed_date":"2008-05-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":69118.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":219400},{"amount":59,"local_amount":67428.57,"processed_date":"2008-06-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":69118.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":248534},{"amount":59,"local_amount":67428.57,"processed_date":"2008-07-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":69118.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277090},{"amount":55,"local_amount":62857.14,"processed_date":"2008-08-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":64432.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":306654}],"funded_date":"2008-02-11T20:03:34Z","paid_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":39475,"name":"Chhun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chhun L., age 28, is married with four little children and lives at SiemReap province, Cambodia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have solid business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Shahnaz baji wants a loan to buy clothes for her cloth selling business.\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":321332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

Her children are what motivate her to do all she does.\r\n\r\nMyrho\u2019s days are long and arduous.  She walks the streets of Julilaca distributing boxes of liquor to various stores and warehouses.  She also brings her merchandise to districts outside of Puno.  This business is beneficial for Myrho and she takes advantage of her free moments to take care of her household chores.  She has been doing this for five years and what she likes least is having to walk so much because it makes her weak and too tired to sell with much gusto.  But she knows she has to do this to get ahead.\r\n\r\nIn the near future, she would like to have her own business in an established place \u2013 possibly a grocery store.  She hasn\u2019t decided exactly what it will be yet.  This is her third loan with MFP and she expects to be able to make her payments on time so she doesn\u2019t cause any problems for the other members of her communal bank.  She is well respected because she is so responsible.  She will increase the merchandise she sells with the 1, 500 she has requested in order to improver her earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":329794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Incremento de mercader\u00eda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-07T01:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Myrho","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":259.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990702},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":259.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211804},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":259.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641329},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":259.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080768},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:48Z","rounded_local_amount":259.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996908},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":259.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842248}],"funded_date":"2009-06-11T01:40:39Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Hubman","image":226625}},{"id":117322,"name":"Merlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlita O. is from the city of Pandan, Gingoog City.

average of four children each; they live in polygamous families in Comorow, one of the villages in the municipality of Loulouni, which lies in the sub-prefecture of Loulouni, the third administrative region of Mali.\r\n\r\nThey collaborate with the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso, in order to manage successfully their agricultural activities during the winter season. They are on their fourth loan from the institution, having repaid the three previous loans correctly.\r\n\r\nThe crops cultivated by the group are sugar peas and rice. Djeneba D. is planning to use her loan to buy agricultural intrants and small equipment, as well as recruiting workers to maintain her hectare of land. The harvested crop is sold to a customer base made up of men and women.

But they live on their own in the rural community of Santa Clara (in the Peruvian mountain range). Some years ago their son started University at Ica (in the coastal regions of Peru) and according to Carlos, it was then when their dreams and aspirations changed.  When he was 17 years old he started work in agriculture and in those days he worked with great zeal on his plantations of potatoes, peas, and fava beans. His plantations were successful and generated great earnings. In time he started a family and since then he has seen an improvement in his earnings. With the funds he saved he managed to purchase more farmland. Today Carlos is able to sell potatoes in very large quantities. He states \"with these harvests I was able to send my son to school\".  He plans on buying a small house in the city of Ica to be closer to their son. There they plan on opening a small grocery store.  This is his fourth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and he is grateful for the support he has received through all this time. With these loans he was able to find many successes and much happiness.

is a 45-year-old man. He is married to Lea and has been blessed with 4 children: Marlin, 23 years old and married; Randy, 20 years old and disabled due to an accident and unable to complete his high school education; Dewi, graduated from senior high school but currently unemployed; Juan, 10 years old and in 4th grade. Danny and his family live in their simple house located in Kolhua Village. \r\n\r\nTo generate daily income, Danny runs a small kiosk. Using the small amount of money that he has, Danny purchases various daily basic needs such as soap, toothpaste, snacks, cigarettes, etc. Danny relies on the profit from his kiosk to meet his family's needs. \r\n\r\nDanny's kiosk is located about 20 meters from the main road and is quite difficult for his customers to reach. This poor location has greatly affected his income. Danny serves just a few customers and can only generate a small income, which he spends to replace his business stock, buy food and pay for electricity and other expenses. Danny feels that his income is very small. As head of the family, he keeps thinking about how to improve his business and generate more income. He believes the solution lies in enlarging his kiosk and finding a strategic location but Danny doesn't have enough capital to do so. \r\n\r\nDanny has tried to find a loan to help him improve his business. Fortunately, he met TLM\u2019s Field Officer who introduced him to TLM\u2019s lending program. Danny is interested in joining the individual program and is requesting a loan of IDR 10,000,000. Danny is hoping to get the loan so he can implement his plan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":713771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

The inhabitants of Nazca are very generous and hospitable people.  This city has a cultural heritage that we, as Peruvians, are very proud of because this is where the Nazca lines are found. They were drawn in a big field and were used by the Nasca culture for farming. They were a type of calendar where the people could figure out when the rainy season would be. These majestic lines attract a great number of tourists. \r\n\r\nPeru is well-known for its exquisite food, but the dish that Elizabeth likes the most is \u201cAji de Gallina\u201d (chile chicken).  She tells us that she could eat this dish every day without tiring of it.  Elizabeth attended school up to the fifth year of high school.  However, she would have liked to have studied administration at the university.  Because her parents did not have sufficient financial resources, she had to work since she was little in order to help at home.\r\n\r\nShe has three children, ages 12, 20, and 22.  The youngest is in the first year of high school, and the older ones attend the university.  Elizabeth struggles a great deal in order to get her children ahead because she is a single mother.  She supports them with great devotion because she wants them to be better than she is.  She wants them to be proud to have a profession and not to have to experience the hardships she lived through since she was little.\r\n\r\nElizabeth sells sweets, soft drinks, and beer.  She used to only sell her products from her tricycle.  But, she saved and now has tables where her customers can sit.  She works around ten hours a day.  She can take care of 30 customers in a day, and she is able to earn up to 100 soles a day; on a very good day she can earn 250 soles.  This helps her with the additional household expenses or her children\u2019s additional educational expenses.  She believes it is going well for her in her business because of her dedication.  She takes very good care of her customers so that they always return to buy her products.\r\n\r\nShe is now very grateful to the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the support they have given her she will be able to buy more merchandise for her business.  With the merchandise she will get greater income in order to improve her quality of life.  She will also have a greater variety of products to sell.  She will also continue saving in order to fulfill her biggest dreams: To give her children a profession and to build her house. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":980252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise (sweets and soft drinks).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-01-16T21:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":120.51},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":126.31},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":129.72},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":135.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":140.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":146.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.19,"local_amount":120.51,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":121.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271206},{"amount":47.37,"local_amount":126.31,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":127.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993856},{"amount":48.64,"local_amount":129.72,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:59:32Z","rounded_local_amount":130.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601762},{"amount":50.9,"local_amount":135.72,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":137.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090878},{"amount":52.81,"local_amount":140.82,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":142.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287221960},{"amount":55.09,"local_amount":146.92,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":148.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298041}],"funded_date":"2012-01-17T01:32:33Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":991787,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Julia con 69 a\u00f1os, de estado civil viuda,vive en casa propia,junto a sus dos hijos, en el distrito de Za\u00f1a,provincia de Lambayeque,departamento de Lambayeque,pa\u00eds Per\u00fa.

Cayara Village Bank is part of FINCA Peru\u2019s Project Wari, an effort to bring micro-loans to rural communities in central Peru. The group is maD. up of 18 members from the Ayacucho region\u2019s Cayara community, who are together requesting loans of $2025 (6200 PEN). The town is located an hour from Huancapi District, on the highway to Southern Ayacucho. The community has three different elevations: a low part suited to growing fruit, a middle ground suited to growing grains, and an elevated section suited to growing tubers, namely potatoes.\r\n<p>\r\nDina, Reyna Marta, and Eufemia are three members of the San Juan Bautista D. Cayara Village Bank.\r\n<p>\r\nDina is married but separated with two children who are 6 and 12 years old and currently attend school. Dina sells dry goods from a small stO., and would like to expand her businesses and sell ground grains. She is requesting a loan of $65 (200 PEN), which she plans to use to buy grains, whole and ground, to bring to the Canaria Mine to sell. She is grateful to work with FINCA; she says it provides a good opportunity to save and to continue to expand her business. Her goals for the future are to proviD. her children with a good education, improve her business, and get ahead in life. She is saving for her children\u2019s education. \r\n<p>\r\nReyna Marta is married and has three children who are 7, 9, and 12 years old. Reyna sells sweets outsiD. several local schools. She also sells lunch to teachers and to workers who are installing an irrigation canal in her community. She is requesting a loan of $65 (200 PEN) to buy mO. sweets to sell and start running her lunch counter from a kiosk in the town\u2019s main plaza. Reyna\u2019s dream is to move her family to a city with mO. opportunities and open up a business in the city of Huamanga. FINCA has helped her save money for herself and for her children. Like Dina, Reyna is saving up for her children\u2019s education. She says her husband plans to start saving, too. \r\n<p>\r\nEufemia lives with her partner and their three children, who are 1, 4, and 9 years old and are all in school. She is involved in Cayara\u2019s local government, and also runs a small stO. and sells household supplies. She is requesting a loan of $200 (600 PEN), which she will use to buy mO. products for her stO. and to help jump-start her savings. Eufemia says that when she first heard that FINCA was coming to Cayara she didn\u2019t believe it, but it did indeed come, and is helping community members to save, which she likes.

A..  It is made up of 9 women and 2 men who meet regularly to organize grant money and determine how they ought to invest it.  They are honest and responsible people.  The women trade in various products, such as clothing, cosmetics, stuffed animals, and cellphones.  They also sell traditional Latin American food.  The men work in the smelting and casting of metals.  Since there is significant competition for business in the commercial sector, the women need to increase the money they have to work with, so that they may stably lower their prices and enable themselves to sell a greater quantity of goods in less time.  By doing this, they will create a greater flow of incoming money, which will allow them to better respond to market demands and to improve quality of life for themselves and their families.

En un futuro le gustar\u00eda cambiar de comercio y en vez de un puesto de pescado en el mercado, tener una tienda de abarrotes.\n","en":"Ang\u00e9lica has been selling fish in the Huayc\u00e1n market for 12 years. She shares a post with her husband, and they work, invest and cover their expenses together. The three children they have are grown up and economically independent. Previously, Ang\u00e9lica worked as a housekeeper in addition to bringing up her children while they were still young. At the age of 37, however, and for the past 12 years, she has been driven to form her own business, and it has gone well. In the past three years, while receiving loans from Edaprospo, she has been able to invest even more in her business. In the future, she would like to switch from selling fish at the market to running a grocery store.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":280685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Invest in capital for fish business and cover some personal costs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huaycan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.083333 -76.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T00:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ang\u00e9lica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":625,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":89.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.39,"local_amount":30.39,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:38Z","rounded_local_amount":30.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084953},{"amount":148.19,"local_amount":148.19,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":148.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978433},{"amount":358.95,"local_amount":358.95,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-02T08:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":358.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439321},{"amount":87.47,"local_amount":87.47,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:47:00Z","rounded_local_amount":87.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669128}],"funded_date":"2009-03-09T02:37:26Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T12:47:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trisha Bury","image":804995}},{"id":96858,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary A. is married and has three children.

their children in Sanoubougou I- Kapel Kourou, an outlying district of the city of Sikasso (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\u00a0 After having run many businesses unsuccessfully, she got introduced to the business of buying and selling cooking oils, Arabian couscous, and Maggie bouillon cubes about seven years ago.\u00a0 She operates at her house and at the market in her district, where she has a spot.\u00a0 She is in high demand by her customers for the quality of her goods.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo satisfy her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso about two years ago.\u00a0 She is now on her second individual loan.\u00a0 The preceding one has been repaid.\u00a0 With this loan, she intends to buy 6 containers of cooking oil, 2 boxes of\u00a0Arabian couscous, and 4 boxes of Maggie cubes. \u00a0 Supplies of these goods are gotten by special order from Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso) and also from local oil producers.\u00a0 She then sells at the retail level,\u00a0cash or credit accepted, to customers composed of women at the district marketplace.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the loan interest.\u00a0 The rest will be invested into the business.<br

Eight out of the 20 have applied for a loan of SLL 8,200,000 from SMT (a partner of Shine on Sierra Leone in Waterloo)\/Kiva lenders in order to meet their immediate financial challenges. \n\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise have not been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business.

He lives with his family in his own house in Banconi, one of the outer suburbs of the town of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nHaving trained as a therapist, he launched himself rapidly into the pharmaceutical business more than twenty years ago. With such a long experience in this domain, he enjoys a good reputation and gets a lot of orders; his resources are however insufficient to satisfy these needs. He thus decided to join the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso, from which he has already had two individual loans, both of which were repaid correctly. \r\n\r\nWith a view to constantly improving his business, he is requesting a third loan which will allow him to buy ten cartons of \"manames\", nine containers of Indian \"inzam\" and three cartons of Aloe (natural medecines).\r\n\r\nHe gets his supplies in Lom\u00e9 (in the Republic of Togo); previously (before he joined Soro Yiriwaso) he stocked up from his supplier in Koutiala in order to resell in his pharmacy in Sikasso's bus station to a customer base made up of travelers, and above all lorry drivers. Some of his customers pay cash and others buy on credit.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 300,000FCFA. With the profits he makes he hopes to be able to cover the bulk of his expenses and those of his family, as well as paying the interest on his loan; the rest will be invested in his business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":579837,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of medicines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yaya ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":127779.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180832},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":63889.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476803},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":63889.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613512},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":63889.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751944},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":63889.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606196},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":63889.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917869},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":63889.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360798}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T20:18:58Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":224714,"name":"Fidele","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N.

In the future, he would like to buy his own house as he currently rents, and he would like to plan for his family's future.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah  Puchner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":588356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy a cow to slaughter and have meat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Nyabugogo-Kigali-Rwanda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":170,"posted_date":"2010-08-23T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fidele","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":166666}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":291.67,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":170625.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172057577},{"amount":291.66,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":170625.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177348871},{"amount":291.67,"local_amount":166666,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":170624.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182483860}],"funded_date":"2010-08-23T18:27:33Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T12:29:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Puchner","image":669957}},{"id":228813,"name":"Tilieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tilieta A. is 32, married, and has five children.

The most difficult problem has been raising capital for her business and  paying for her children\u2019s education and building a house of her own.  She plans to invest this loan in agricultural products, namely in the production  of cash crops and other farm produce such as, cassava, corn, and cocoyams. \r\n\r\nShe is most  especially interested in cassava which is used in the production of gari and water-fufu (staple dishes). She also plans to invest part in her general provisions store which will raise daily income for her family. She believes the business will succeed because she has been in the business for a long time and that she born a farmer and now she has become an expert in farming over the past years. She also thinks her approach to her customers will be captivating and hence lead to the success of her business. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford at least three meals per day at reasonable prices.\r\n\r\nFlorence will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her house rent and save for a rainy day. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost of obtaining and ease of paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her husband, her co-wife, and their children in the Sogomougou district of Koutiala City. \u00a0Due to family problems, Mariam could not continue with her schooling, which is why she soon became interested  in commerce at an early age, along side her mom. After having run several revenue-generating businesses, she opted in the end to buy and sell peanuts and has been doing so for twenty years now. \r\n\r\nIn order to increase her working capital and to expand her business, Mariam turned toward the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso seven years ago. She took out thirteen loans with the association (solidarity loans) that were all properly repaid. She is now on her first individual loan. With this financing, she intends to buy 10 sacks of peanuts from grain stockers of Koutiala and to make her sales at the main market. Her  customer base is composed of women and men. Sales are made in cash and generally at the retail level. \r\n\r\nShe plans on a monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA that she envisions using for repaying the interest on the Soro loan and improving her family\u2019s living conditions. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":790873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy sacks of peanuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":116666.66,"processed_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":118106.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750970},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":59053.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120277},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":59053.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882109},{"amount":129.16,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":59053.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699200},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":58333.35,"processed_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":59053.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655464}],"funded_date":"2011-07-05T02:18:32Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":310773,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecilia is 44 years old and married to Josphat.

Now that his parents are old, they are thinking about leaving the bread shop to him so that he can carry on the family tradition. However, he has demonstrated little interest to take on this task because he has liked to fix radios, televisions, etc. since he was very young.

Since then, he has saved little by little to establish a shop on his own without family support. With an age 46 years and 23 years of local experience, he requests this loan to adapt his shop to the necesities of the job. At the same time, he needs capital to equip his small workshop. Each day that he works, he thinks about growing his shop. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Brittany Thatcher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":230739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To equip his workshop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T23:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gerardo German","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":299.3},{"due_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":305.1},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":311.01},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":317.03},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":323.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":329.43},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":335.81},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":342.32},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":348.95},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":355.71},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":362.6},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":369.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.02},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.86},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":44.71},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.57},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.46},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.36},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":48.27},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":49.21},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":51.13},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.12},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.02,"local_amount":299.3,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":303.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312521},{"amount":43.86,"local_amount":305.1,"processed_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":309.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9929873},{"amount":44.71,"local_amount":311.01,"processed_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":315.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9929874},{"amount":45.57,"local_amount":317.03,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":321.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10213504},{"amount":93.81,"local_amount":652.6,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":661.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20393648},{"amount":48.27,"local_amount":335.81,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-19T08:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":340.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20393649},{"amount":99.21,"local_amount":690.17,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:49:36Z","rounded_local_amount":699.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27085380},{"amount":156.55,"local_amount":1088.98,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:26:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1104.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978858}],"funded_date":"2008-12-10T01:43:03Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T15:26:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Thatcher","image":null}},{"id":80490,"name":"Vicenta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicenta D. is 52 years old and married with ten children.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Hato Mayor is a fairly mountainous region where the principal industry is agriculture. Ana's community, like nearly all impoverished areas in the Dominican Republic, suffers from a constant shortage of running water and electricity. As well as Dominicans, Haitian immigrants make up a large proportion of Ana's community.<p>\r\n  \r\nAna is a former member of the 'Nueva Esperanza' ('New Hope') 'solidarity bank' (group of borrowers). Because she now requires a larger amount, Ana is requesting an individual loan to buy additional stock for her two-year-old clothing business. She would also like to put a small portion of the loan into a savings account set up with Esperanza International, Kiva's field partner in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. <p>\r\n\r\nAna is very excited about taking out another loan so that she can continue to grow her business.

Reem is married and a mother of one son. \r\n\r\nShe took out a loan from FATEN in order to expand her grocery store and to add frozen meat and vegetables to the items she sells in the store. She especially wants to do this since her grocery store is located in a privileged location of the Jabalia Refugee Camp. This loan will help Reem attract more clients and have a better income. \r\n\r\nReem is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed in her place. \r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. \r\n\r\nFATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. \r\n\r\nAs with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

The couple has a child named Mikyla Jane who is now three years old. \r\n\r\nMichelle sells vegetables in their place and is proposing to Kiva lenders to borrow PHP 6,000 in order to make her business grow and be more beneficial for her family, especially for her child who soon will enter school. She purchases fresh vegetables in their public market then sells them in the village. Michelle also wants to venture into a direct-selling business if she will have enough capital, so that she will have another extra source of income aside from vending.\r\n\r\nAt present, her family is living in the house of her parents-in-law.

He is 30 years old and the father of 4 children, ages 3 to 9.  The older children attend school.  He lives in a home he owns in Massaca, in the Boane district, with his family and a brother.  He is in his third year in the teaching program at the Teacher's University in Maputo.  His wife also works as a preschool teacher.\r\n\r\nHe lived with his parents in the city of Maputo until he got married, when he decided to move to Massaca.  He has worked as a teacher for more than 10 years.  He graduated from the Institute of Elementary Education of Matola (IMAP).  He currently earns a monthly salary of 7.000.00 MT.  He has a maid, and sometimes is able to save around 2.000.00MT per month.\r\n\r\nNarciso had already requested a loan from the BIM commercial bank for the amount of 29.000.00MT to begin construction on his home.  He learned about Hluvuku through friends who are clients and after an analysis, decided to take out loans through Hluvuku.  This 25.000.000MT loan is his third with Hluvuku, and will be used to purchase doors, cement, stones, sand, etc.  The previous loans were for 15.000.00MT, 20.000.00MT and 35.000.00MT, all for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to take out more loans to complete his home and to purchase a car, as a way to provide more comfort and convenience to his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br
