Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  food vending and general store businesses. Her husband Sunny V., who is 39 years old, works as a driver to earn his living.  They have two children who are 8 and 10 years old. \r\n\r\nLerma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lerma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future to sustain their daily needs and to educate their children. Lerma V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Kanipaan, San Carlos City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 15,000 PHP. Marilou is borrowing 23,000 PHP so that she can continue to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 20,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Marilou  aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She lives in Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her sari sari (general) store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  Eduvijes is borrowing PHP 24,000 to purchase more stock to sell in her sari-sari store. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 21,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Eduvijes aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way.

He started working at an early age.  When he was only ten years old he sold natural herb remedies in the street and then started working as a salesman in a shop.  And so as a natural businessman he started to save some money to start his own business.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the limited but valuable money that he was able to save through much sacrifice, he took the first step and bought his first goods to sell.  He was then able to become independent by renting a stall in the local market, almost right next to where he used to work, where he now sells embroidered bedspreads, blankets, local clothing and hammocks.\r\n<p>\r\nHis business started to be profitable and he knew how to advantage of his success.  He expanded his store and started to take out loans that he paid back on time.\r\n<p>\r\nHaving passed a critical stage in his business and realizing that his business could not continue to grow where it was, he decided to close his store to look for new opportunities in order to increase his market.  He then began a style of business that is well known in his area, called \u2018macate\u2019 (traveling sales on credit from house to house) selling the same products that he sold in his previous business. He started to travel to other richer cities and was able to build a larger clientele so that his business now expands more every day.\r\n<p>\r\nThanks to his efforts he has already bought a motorcycle that he uses as a key element in his work.  V\u00edctor hopes to obtain a new loan with which he will buy more wholesale cotton thread in different colors to make bedspreads.  He will then give this thread to his family and other people who he will pay to make bedspreads, starting a chain reaction of development in his family and his neighborhood.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Alexandra Jaffe, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nV\u00edctor Hugo; tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero y sin hijos, vive con sus padres y es uno de  los 9 hijos de esta familia.

Alongside her partner and three children, she tries to progress and would like to have her own home very soon.  In the meantime, they will continue to live in her parent\u2019s house.  \r\n\r\nShe has been working as an accountant for a firm for more than 3 years, but her work schedule is taking her away from her loved ones.  Even though she benefits from a salary, Martha will try to increase her savings by investing in the purchase of a stand where she can sell clothing.  She is close to doing this because of her partner\u2019s support.  However, even though she doesn\u2019t have a place to sell from, she\u2019s already beginning to receive requests for items of clothing from her colleagues at work.  Martha is certain that by starting her business in this way, she will be able to reach her goal bit by bit.  \r\n\r\nShe is one of the founders of this group and remembers how her first loans were an opportunity for her to get ahead.  In spite of having left the group for some time, today her friends are opening the doors of their communal bank to her because she is a responsible woman.  \r\n\r\nShe will purchase the clothing that has been ordered with this loan of 2000 soles and in this way begin her business on the right foot.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva

These board members came to SMT\/Kiva to seek a loan of Le 7,000,000 after several unsuccessful attempts from other NGOs within and outside of Makeni town. They have planted a rice farm of 120 acres of land in a village called Rulakoh, about seven miles from Makeni, but are currently in need of labor to help them in the weeding, bird scareing and harvesting. Thus with the Le 7,000,000.00, they will be able to achieve this. \r\n\r\nCSAC is a community based organization registered in 2004 to help ensure the well being of the disabled and their children in the Bombali district. The organization has a membership of 1000 disabled drawn from four different categories of the disabled: leprosy victims, polio victims, amputees and the blind. CSAC carries out agricultural activities and provides free schooling for the children of the disabled.\r\n\r\nAlimany Edward K. is the founder of this organization. He has lived in New York for over twenty-four years but had never seen the disabled begging for a living. But back home in Sierra Leone, the disabled, together with their children, go out begging for a living. This was appalling to Alimany, especially so for the children who were not handicapped. Without any form of empowerment for these children, their plight will be miserable in the future once their parents have passed away \u2013 begging will no longer help them since they are not in any way handicapped. Thus Alimany K. decided to form this organization to help the handicapped by engaging them in agriculture and setting up of a school for their children. \r\n\r\nSo far, CSAC has been able to give education to over 200 children of the disabled. They also give medical and feeding assistance to the most vulnerable of the disabled. However, their two main challenges are 1) labor vacuum \u2013 because of their disabilities, they can not work efficiently on the farm and 2) inadequate funds to ensure proper implementation of their programs.

This business came into being because she wanted to be able to not leave her home, while still generating an income to help her husband with the expenses. The reason for not wanting to work outside of her house is that she has 3 children, one of whom is disabled, and he needs to be cared for with a lot of attention.

She lives with her husband and their three school age children.  She never worked.  She was only a housewife.  When they fired her husband, she did not know where to get money, and she went through some very difficult times.\r\n\r\nHer husband did not find work, and neither did she.  But, she did have a very good friend who told her to do something because her children were suffering.  Her friend, Bertha, helped her a lot.  Bertha motivated her to travel and get comforters.\r\n\r\nThat is the work she now does.  She delivers the comforters to stores and women for cash or credit.  She is happy now because she has income, and they do not have to suffer or worry about food like a lot of women.  She got ahead, and she was not left behind.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from the loan to buy wholesale merchandise.  Elizabeth is very grateful to Emprender and Kiva.  They gave her a hand in the moments that were difficult for her.

Her life is very tough because all of her children are still small.  If just depending on some perches of corn land, their family would not have enough to eat.  She cannot work far from home either, because that means she would not have time to take care of her children.  With this situation, Mrs. H. chose to stay home and breed animals.  In order to buy piglets, Mrs. H. borrowed money from TYM Fund (Kiva Partner in Vietnam).  Since she pays the weekly repayments, at the end of each loan term, the amount of loan unpaid is not too much.  Thus, she can  keep most of the money she got from selling the pigs.  Her family income increases significantly with each loan.  All of her children are able to go to school.  She wants to borrow 525USD to buy piglets.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb H., 30 tu\u1ed5i, s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 4 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con t\u1ea1i H\u01b0ng Nguy\u00ean, Ngh\u1ec7 An.

Tarqu\u00ed is characterized by its plains, and it is the sector that produces the most milk and dairy livestock.  Its climate is cold.  Most of the people work in agriculture and livestock.  A large part of the population of youths has immigrated to different parts of the world to give their families economic stability.  The members, with their characteristic charisma, tell us their stories.\r\n\r\nDelia Eudocial V. V. lives in the Chilcato Tora community in the Tarqu\u00ed parish.  She is a member of the communal bank with the same name as her community.  She is 55, married, and has seven children.  She does not remember their ages because they are all adults and married.  She only remembers that her last daughter is 27, and she is the only one that is single.  Three of her married children live in her house and help economically once in a while.  They have their own responsibilities in the home.  Her husband is a farmer, and through his work in his youth they were able to build a house.\r\n\r\nDelia has been a farmer ever since she was young.  She plants cabbage, lettuce, and turnips, etc.  She raises hens and sells their eggs.  She has two calves, and she is raising them to later sell.  She also has a small store, but she is lacking a lot of supplies.\r\n\r\nWithin the communal bank the members are very good friends.  They are from the same community, and they have known each other for several years.  This is her first loan with the foundation.  She will buy products like rice, sugar, oil, and noodles, etc. to better stock her store.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have no more debts.  She is now helping her son who traveled abroad to pay the expenses he incurred on his trip.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Tr\u00e1nsito P. C. is another member of the Mujeres de Chilcato Tora Communal Bank.  She lives in the community that has the same name as her bank in the Tarqu\u00ed parish.  She is 65, married, and has five children.  She does not remember the ages of her children.  She only remembers the age of her last child who is 25, single, and still lives with her.  Her husband does not work because he became allergic to the cement dust.  This stopped him from doing his work.  She and her husband built a small adobe house.  Their economic situation is down, and all of the community knows it.  Also, she was diagnosed with diabetes five years ago.  Now she has to take very good care of herself to not have a relapse in her health.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been raising chickens for a short time.  She also has a cow, and she sells her milk to the milk carts in the area.  But, they pay very little.  This is her first loan with the foundation.  All of her friends supported her joining, and she tries to get ahead with the benefits the foundation offers their members.  With this loan from ESPOIR she will buy more chickens, food, and vitamins for their growth.  This way she will expand her business and have a secure income to pay the medication and household expenses.  Her dream is to see all of her children succeed personally and economically.  \r\n\r\nTeresa Elvira C. C. lives in the Chilcato Tora community in the Tarqu\u00ed parish.  She is a member of the communal bank with the same name as her community.  She is 47, married, and has six children; ages 24, 22, 20, 14, 11, and 9.  Her first daughter is studying dressmaking at an open academy.  Her second daughter is married and lives independently.  Her 20 year old son works in construction, but all of the money is only for his expenses.  Her last three children are still in school.  Her husband migrated to the exterior to give them a better future.  Thanks to that, they have been able to build their own house.\r\n\r\nTerese is a farmer; most of her crops are for household consumption.  She also raises animals like dairy cows, pigs, and chickens, etc.  She sells them in the community.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with the foundation.  She hopes to improve her economic situation and that of her family.  With the loan from the ESPOIR Foundation she will buy more animals like chickens and pigs, food, and vitamins to take care of them.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to have a large farm and to be a great animal merchant.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

\u0110\u00f4ng Anh - H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i. Hu\u1ec7 is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by SEDA. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is C\u1ed5 D\u01b0\u01a1ng 2 (1).\r\n\r\nHu\u1ec7 is married and has two adult children. She works in a family business planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale. She has been engaged in this business for over ten years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Hu\u1ec7 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,148,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.\r\n\r\nHu\u1ec7 is now requesting a new loan of 3,706,000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding her business. The loan will be her 9th from SEDA. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n\r\n1. L\u00ea Th\u1ecb L\u00fd (10114070014) is a 43-year-old female who is requesting a 5,014,000 VND loan to support her business making and selling food.\r\n\r\n2. Ng\u00f4 Th\u1ecb N.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****************************************************\r\nHu\u1ec7 Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb (10114070013) l\u00e0 55 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

They have 2 children who are 10 and 12 years old.\r\n\r\nRosalinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase a fishing boat so that she can continue to save up for future business improvements. Rosalinda Nidar F. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She lives in  Brgy. 9, Isabela, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1997 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her three businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Merlinda is now borrowing PHP 30,000 in order to fund the operations of her tobacco business. This will be her 19th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Merlinda hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The area is known for its beautiful beaches that surround this lovely place and are frequented by local and foreign tourists who know the locale as Crucita la Bella.\r\n\r\nOdixa is the founding member of the communal bank and she likes it because with the loans she has been able to grow her business and improve her quality of life. She is 39 years old. She is married, and from this marriage she has two children: a son who is 20 and a daughter who is 10 years old. They are studying at the university and at school. Her husband raises chickens.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband raise chickens. She tells us that they sell up to 200 chickens a month. They have these chickens for two months so they can later slaughter them and take them to the local markets and the Portoviejo market. They work every day feeding and taking care of the chickens so they can have good production. She says that these little animals need a lot of care because if they are not cared for there can be many losses because the chickens are delicate. But she tells us that thanks to God, they have never lost many.\r\n\r\nThis loan is for buying chickens, feed, and medicines so they can have good production. Her dream is to have a car to transport her products and the purchases that they have every month."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":693235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy chickens, feed, and medicines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-01-15T22:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Odixa Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422784},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195841550},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283931},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:20Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206151841},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211224679}],"funded_date":"2011-01-16T05:17:26Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:13:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Olivia Shirley","image":836829}},{"id":269468,"name":"Renzo Edemir","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Renzo, reside en El Transito, departamento de San Miguel, donde vive con su familia, su esposa y una hija de un a\u00f1o de edad, solo \u00e9l trabaja para cubrir los gastos del hogar, su edad es de 22 a\u00f1os, Renzo comenz\u00f3 solo como observador del comercio de cerdos, negocio que le gusto ya que tiene al frente de su vivienda el tiangue donde se comercializa animales (ganado, cerdos), debido a la necesidad de obtener un negocio comenz\u00f3 comprando cerdos para comercializarlos, tambi\u00e9n aprendi\u00f3 alba\u00f1iler\u00eda que al igual se dedica por tiempos a este trabajo.\nActualmente est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de materiales para mejorar el piso de su casa,  los materiales a usar ser\u00e1n arena, cemento y ladrillo, con este pr\u00e9stamo espera adquirir todo lo antes mencionado para realizar el trabajo y mejorar la calidad de vida de su familia, ya que estar\u00e1n en un hogar con mejores condiciones y mejor vistosidad.\nPara \u00e9l su mayor deseo es trabajar con mucho entusiasmo logrando vivir con su familia de una forma ordenada y digna, sin pasar dificultades grandes.\n","en":"Renzo lives in El Transito in the department of San Miguel.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from serving a variety of different meals like afritada, caldereta, bulalo and humba to customers in the local community. Ruth has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ruth joined Kiva's partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Ruth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase food and drinks for the restaurant. Ruth is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional raw ingredients like meat, vegetables and spices. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Ruth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

We work to offer reliable, efficient, and affordable technologies to households to improve their livelihoods. \n\nWork in this sector began at SOSAI in 2010. The organisation had existed as a fully commercial company before this, but now we operate as a social enterprise. \n\nSOSAI was set up by Habiba, who is a founder, and who had worked for Developmental Association for Renewable Energies (DARE), where she had got the opportunity to carry out exhibitions and workshops for people in rural areas and urban slums highlighting the benefits of renewable energies. Because DARE is an NGO sales were limited by DARE, so Habiba decided to branch out to revive SOSAI. With benefitting people at the forefront, running this organisation as a social enterprise was paramount. \n\nThe idea behind the project of creating micro-enterprise by providing solar lighting is to empower small entrepreneurs who can penetrate more communities by giving them the opportunity to buy products and pay for them in installments, with an agreed upon plan and model. This will develop micro-enterprise, especially for women, while ensuring that a large number of people get all-important lighting into their homes, at the same time empowering more by giving them a means of livelihood. With the high number of households not connected to the grid--despite its rich energy resources--Nigeria is a fertile ground to grow this business as in the past 10 years (in spite of the government's promises) the power sector has only worsened with more power cuts and fewer people being connected to the grid. \n\nAccording to the WHO 1.6 million deaths occur yearly from indoor air pollution; this project will in the long run reduce green-house gas emissions while improving maternal health and ensuring basic education as longer study hours will be ensured. \n\nBenefits accruable to using Solar Home Systems as provided by Barefoot Power are immense, but the most important reason for SOSAI undertaking this comes from a personal experience Habiba has had with kerosene lamps while assisting her mother who owned a \"Bukka,\" a term used to describe a small eatery, where they worked till late at night using kerosene lamps. Her mother currently has an eye problem because of the exposure to indoor air pollution and Habiba herself wears glasses. What better drive to promote a cleaner source of lighting than personal experience? \n\nThe business model will be fully developed to include training for the business owners and training of technical staff that will ensure the warranty Barefoot Power prides itself in. \n\nThis loan will enable SOSAI to better promote this sales model and move deeper into the rural areas especially to give us the strength to be able to fall back and take on the steam at anytime. \n\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1198189,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2750,"youtubeId":"L9KUyO_dG0k","title":"Kiva Borrower Habiba from Tanzania","thumbnailImageId":1198189},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"To sell solar lighting to people who doesn't have electricity","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":22975,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Habiba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":22975,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":22975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6975},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":16000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6975},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":486909,"name":"Hien","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hien would like to take a further loan to buy more computers and game cards for his shop.

Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"The Azucenas CommUnity (CommUnity is a term used by Friendship Bridge to refer to the Communal Banks) is composed of a group of women who surprise the inspectors with their organization and punctuality. Members of Azucenas always arrive to repayment and disbursement meetings on time, then proceed to sit down orderly and wait for the credit agent to assign their turn to speak, when everyting is in place. This organization is also evident in the financial aspect. These women have been working, collaborating and sharing for approximately seven years. The recipe for this Community to stay together for so long lays in the combination of different ingredients these women have combined, such as promptness of repayment, honesty, solidarity and trust.\r\n<p>Almost all the members of this CommUnity have been and are weavers.  From a young age, they learned the backstrap loom weaving technique, producing naturally colored fabrics. They have learned to color threads using natural dyes, which they get from the mountains. They use the trunk of the banana tree to fix colors and the trunk of avocado, leaves from different bushes, medicinal plants and food ingredients to obtain the dyes. They learned these techniques, which have been passed on for generations in San Juan la Laguna, from their mothers and grandmothers.\r\n<p>They will invest the credit in buying thread wholesale, in order to decrease production costs. One of the women is a painter and she\u2019ll use the loan to buy oil paint. Mar\u00eda C. Gonzales mentioned that her son is sick and she\u2019ll have to make a great effort and invest half of the loan in her business and use the other half to buy medicines for her son.  \r\n<p>Members of Azucena have several dreams. Maril\u00fa Jacinta C. pointed out that she wants to send her son, recently graduated from high-school, to college. For that she needs her business to keep prospering as it has been recently. Concepci\u00f3n M. wants another loan because she would like her business to consolidate to the point where she\u2019s able to buy a small lot of land for her son. \r\n<p>These women constitute an example for all the indigenous women in the region.  Many years ago, they decided to become financially independent and support their respective husbands with extra money to cover household expenses.\r\n<p> Thanks to their effort they are reaching their goals, sending their children to school and providing them with a permanent roof and sufficient food, in order for them to advance. The Azucenas are a typical example of Guatemalan indigenous women, who set the well-being of their families above their own. Nonetheless, if their businesses grow and prosper in the way they have projected, that situation doesn\u2019t have to continue, and all will be able to enjoy a good life. Help them!  \r\n<P>One of the women was not able to be in the picture, due to health issues. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa ComUnidad Azucenas (ComUnidad es un t\u00e9rmino que utiliza Friendship Bridge para llamar a los Bancos comunales) est\u00e1 conformado por un grupo de se\u00f1oras que sorprenden a los veedores por su organizaci\u00f3n y puntualidad. Las Azucenas siempre llegan a las reuniones de repago y desembolso a la hora exacta, luego prosiguen a sentarse en orden y esperan a que la agente de cr\u00e9dito les de la palabra inicial una vez que todo est\u00e1 en orden. Esta organizaci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n se ve en el aspecto financiero. Estas se\u00f1oras han venido trabajando, colaborando y compartiendo juntas desde hace aproximadamente 7 a\u00f1os. La receta para que esta ComUnidad haya permanecido junta por tanto tiempo es que esta se\u00f1oras han combinado distintos ingredientes como: la puntualidad del repago, la honestidad, la solidaridad y la confianza. \r\n<P>Casi todas de las integrantes de esta ComUnidad han sido y son tejedoras. Desde peque\u00f1as ellas aprendieron a tejer con la t\u00e9cnica de telar de cintura, telas te\u00f1idas con tintes naturales. Adem\u00e1s, ellas aprendieron a te\u00f1ir los hilos con tintes naturales. Estos tintes naturales las se\u00f1oras los traen de las monta\u00f1as. Ellas utilizan el tronco del banano como fijador de colores, el tronco del aguacate, hojas de arbustos, plantas medicinales e ingredientes de comida para sacar los tintes. Las t\u00e9cnicas que ellas utilizan las aprendieron de sus madres y abuelas. Son tradiciones que han sido aprendidas por generaciones en San Juan la Laguna. \r\n<P>Estas se\u00f1oras van a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en comprar hilo al por mayor para reducir sus costos de producci\u00f3n. Una de las se\u00f1oras es pintora. Ella va a utilizar el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar pintura \u00f3leo. Mar\u00eda C. Gonzales coment\u00f3 que su hijo estaba enfermo. Ella va a hacer malabares para invertir la mitad de su cr\u00e9dito en su negocio y la otra mitad en comprar medicinas para su hijo. \r\n<P>Las integrantes de las Azucenas tienen varios sue\u00f1os. Maril\u00fa Jacinta C. coment\u00f3 que ella quiere mandar a su hijo reci\u00e9n graduado del colegio a la universidad. Lo \u00fanico que necesita es que su negocio siga prosperando de la misma manera como ha venido sucediendo. Concepci\u00f3n M. quiere otro pr\u00e9stamo porque quiere que su negocio se consolide al punto donde ella pueda ganar lo suficiente para poder comprar un terrenito para su hijo. \r\n<P>Estas se\u00f1oras son un ejemplo para todas las mujeres ind\u00edgenas de la regi\u00f3n. Muchos a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s ellas decidieron independizarse econ\u00f3micamente y apoyar a sus respectivos maridos con dinero extra para cubrir los gastos de la casa.\r\n<P>Gracias a su esfuerzo ellas est\u00e1n cumpliendo sus objetivos, mandar a sus hijos a la escuela y proveerles un techo permanente y suficiente comida para que puedan salir adelante. Las Azucenas son un t\u00edpico ejemplo de la mujer ind\u00edgena Guatemalteca, ellas ponen el bienestar de su familia por encima del de ellas. Sin embargo, si sus negocio crecen y prosperan de la manera como ellas han proyectado, esa situaci\u00f3n no va a tener que suceder, ya que todos van a poder disfrutar de una buena vida. Ay\u00fadenlas a salir adelante!\r\n<P>Una de las se\u00f1oras no pudo estar presente en la fotograf\u00eda por razones de

The care that she takes to feed the animals and supply them with occasional medical visits from the veterinarian has increased their population and so now she guides them into the field each day for feeding. <p>\r\n\r\nShe makes sure not to neglect her role as a mother, because she\u2019s also very dedicated to lovingly raising her three children, who also help out in caring for the animals during their free time.

It is for this reason that she\u2019s requesting a loan of 2000 Somoni (600 USD) for the term of 12 months to buy small cattle and fodder for her animals.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

E. is a single woman who lives in Sitio San Juan, Brgy. Caradio-an, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  General Store and E-load retailer businesses. \r\n\r\nChelistie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Chelistie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her businesses so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her businesses. \r\n\r\nChelistie E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She was married to Mr. Ndifon Augustin and is blessed with five children, two of them are under fifteen years old. They live in a three room apartment in Tumuku quarter in the Belo subdivision. Evelyn received her first loan of 50,000 FCFA from GHAPE in 2009. She embarked on a retail store business in her area.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is applying for her second loan to increase stock in her store. This loan will be used to buy 20 liters of honey for 30,000 FCFA, 100kg of rice for 30,000 FCFA, a cartoon of soap for 15,000 FCFA, and 125kg of groundnut for 35,000 FCFA. She knows that her trade will be a success because her store is the only one in the quarter and she always meets the demands of the people. Her trade actually helps the community since the demands of the people are satisfied. \r\n\r\nEvelyn had problems in life when the husband died and she was unable to pay her children's school fees. She will use the gain from her loan to buy a plot of land for her children and educate them. She preferred a loan from GHAPE because repayment is in small installments and it offers some training on how loans are to be used.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

women who create a village bank through which they receive assistance in terms of loans. The main goal is to give them the opportunity to carry out economic activities which enable them to live in dignity and contribute to a better quality of life in their homes. Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. What is more, the sense of belonging to a group gives these poor women, as members of a Committee, the energy and motivation to reach success.<p> \r\n\r\nThe Committee \u201c29 de setiembre\u201d (September 29th) is formed of a group of 20 women who live in Limpio. A woman who wanted to become member of another Committee in Villa Elisa city could not make it because she was not living in the same town. As a result she contacted 19 other women living in the same town (Limpio) and convinced them to form another group. That is how \u201c29 de septiembre\u201d  \r\n(September 29th) was born. Today the Commitee is on its 8th loan cycle and they can request loans ranging from 100.000 to 1.600.000 guaranies (US$ 25 to 400) per member.<p>\r\n\r\nAmong the businesses these women run are: despensas (grocery stores), sewing shops, sales of cheese, food, drinks, jewelry, cloth, fruits, vegetables, lingerie, and sheets. The money provided by the loan will be used for the purchase of lingerie, meat, vegetables, fruits, jewelry, candies, fabrics, thread, cloth and others. <p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4900,"image":{"id":156476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of lingerie, meat, vegetables, fruits, jewelry, candies, fabrics, thread, cloth and others","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Mariano R.

The soil in Nekmese Naet Village where Ande lives is fertile, and it has potential to growth coconut and banana. Most of the community in this village relies on the agricultural sector to earn money. The weather and climate in this area is good as the season changes every 6 months. \r\n\r\nAnde is interested in the cattle fattening program because he wants to improve his living standard as a farmer, and the availability of cattle food that he has encourages him to join the cattle fattening program.

V., age 43, lives in Bosa-Brasil.  This neighborhood is just to the south of the capital of Colombia.  Myriam says that her community is united, and the people work together.  There is a great sense of belonging in her community.  \r\n\r\nThat is where she has been able to generate income by working in her own business of making different sizes of felt and foam rollers.\r\n\r\nHer family consists of her three children; ages 24, 12, and 6; and her life partner.  He also works in this activity; he started the business.  Myriam owes it to the experience her husband got when he retired from a company where he learned to make the rollers they now sell.  That is how they decided to live surrounded by handles, covers, screws, felt, and foam. \r\n\r\nWith her first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo she got greater work opportunities.  She was able to add more products or elements to her business.  Now, with this second loan for 1,000,000 COP, she will make repairs to a damaged machine that injects plastic.  Because the machine is damaged their production has been affected.\r\n\r\nWith this money she will also buy materials like handles, covers, screws, felt, and foam.  That way she will continue working in her own house with her husband.  Her biggest challenge is to become a consolidated business at a commercial and labor level in the market.  Part of this challenge is to add other modern machines to improve her work effort.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns good profits from the income generated by these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1997, Josefina joined ASHI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Josefina has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASHI and she received a 100% credit rating. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. \r\n<p>\r\nJosefina is requesting a new loan of 44,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and additional piglets so she can earn more revenue. This will be the tenth loan taken out by Josefina from ASHI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. This will allow Josefina to grow her hog raising business further so that her four children can fulfill their dreams of managing their own business someday. Josefina wants to give her family a decent life.\r\n<p>\r\nJosefina's long term goal is to continue to build her secondary fishing business. She wants to purchase additional raw materials for her fishing business so she can expand it. This will allow her to sell more fish in the local community and in the surrounding neighborhoods. She also hopes to have successful pig farm

She has two employees that work with her and her workshop is in her home.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy fabric and other dressmaking supplies.\r\n\r\nHer dream is that she always has work and good health.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":594630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":" To buy fabric, thread, zippers, buttons, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-09-05T01:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":96.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113595},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:38Z","rounded_local_amount":96.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407343},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":96.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407344},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":96.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388461},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":96.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388462},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":96.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388463},{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682872}],"funded_date":"2010-09-05T06:44:37Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:11:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":232618,"name":"Hanh's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanh T.

The eldest, 16, is a college student and the two youngest, 9 and 11, are elementary grade pupils. The family\u2019s main source of income is the salary of her husband, but the cost of living in the city is so expensive that she decided to help her husband with their financial needs. She looked for people to help her financially and she found Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), a partner of Kiva in the Philippines. She was encouraged to join because of the principles and program that the institution offers. She consulted her husband about her plan, he approved, and she became a member in 2004. She used her previous loans to start a small store business. Her husband is grateful because his wife now helps to support the family. Sheridan is happy as well because, as years passed, her customers have increased and she is earning more. Now she is applying for another loan of PHP 23000 to buy more grocery products. She wants to buy more sacks of rice for retail, soft drinks, liquors, canned goods, assorted snack foods and noodles, kitchen ingredients and personal beauty products. She will be delighted if Kiva lenders will assist her financially. She is hoping that the partnership of ASHI and Kiva will continue and prosper."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":612832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is from El Consuelo, in Pueblo Nuevo, Estel\u00ed.  Marlon has two children aged 8 and 3.  Ten years ago, he travelled to Costa Rica to work and save some money.  As a result, he was able to buy three 'manzanas' of farmland (one 'manzana' = 1.68 acres), and a plot of land where he built his house.  He grows his coffee with the help of his wife who has supported him from the beginning.  When work is slower during the sowing season, he works as a day laborer on neighboring farms. \r\n\r\nMarlon requested this loan to buy manure, supplies, insecticides and fertilizers for his coffee crops, and to pay laborers.

The majority of our population eats tortillas with all three meals.  We sell our product to our neighbors and to nearby eating establishments in our neighborhood.  Around here there are many places to eat because our national soccer stadium is located very close to us.\r\nWith our jobs we have helped our families get ahead.

He works as a nursing assistant and has two children: the oldest is 8 years old and is in second grade, and the youngest is 4. His wife also works as a nursing assistant and together they share household expenses. It's important to mention that since Lucas was very young he has supported his mother. He started working at a young age since his family has limited economic resources, and carried out his work with a lot of responsibility. He feels happy with his job because he helps many people in the Jacinto Baca region. He's studying for a nursing degree, and it's worth emphasizing that this young man is characterized by his modesty and humility, but he posses a strong desire for personal improvement. He aspires to become an excellent professional so he can continue helping his family and the entire community. His goal is to little by little improve his quality of life and that his family lacks nothing.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva
