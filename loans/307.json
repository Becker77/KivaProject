most of the women in her village, Magdalena has many irons in the fire.

She also grows vegetables, and with this loan she will buy a calf to raise for sale. \r\nMagdalena is 40 and has five children, four of school age. Two of them are still in school, but the 13- and 14-year-olds are now working instead of going to school. She herself never went to school and does not read or write. Magdalena's husband left long ago. Magdalena hopes someday to rent another little plot of land to grow more vegetables. Magdalena's village is nestled right against the side of the Santa Maria volcano, part of a complex of volcanoes that regularly rumbles the area and that completely destroyed the village in the early 20th century. It's a place of beautiful green hillsides and lush plots of corn and vegetables, all divided into little sections called cuerdas. The poorer women often rent just one cuerda and try to grow their own corn for the family and sell some vegetables from it. Those who have more sometimes own two or more cuerdas, and sometimes rent even more. It's hard work, and they always refer to their life as a \"battle\" or \"struggle\", but they continue with the battle to feed their families and keep the kids in school.\r\nWritten by Randy Fay and

Her excellent performance in ASHI in terms of repayment and business all throughout her membership made her one of the most outstanding member. Despite the financial struggle she had in all of her life since birth and during marriage especially on raising her 11 children whose age range is from six to 25 years old, she had manage to remain strong and happy. Her loving husband who is a driver has been so supportive to her especially on her desire for requesting bigger amount of loan. As agreed by both of them, Rose Eden is now requesting for a much bigger amount of loan which will be used for buying a new motorcycle intended for a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) for hire business to be managed by her husband. This is to replace their old second hand motorcycle which was bought more than five years ago.\n\nTricycle is one of the most common means of transportation people in the municipality take in going to different villages and neighboring municipalities. \n\nThough at some point of her life, Rose Eden is so disappointed because three of her elder children had decided to stop schooling yet she never loses hope that the rest of them aside from her disabled child will be pursuing their education. She hoped that through her continues loaning, she will be able to grow her business to be able to sustain the education of their children and improve their standard of living.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":400893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Thanks to the support of her spouse and her own effort, she was able to expand her business, which began with little inventory and in a small space and now has a bigger space and a large clientele.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has two children and one dependent to take care of.\r\n\r\nGiven the variety of fruits, vegetables and other foods that she sells, Immaculate has managed to attract and hold her own big and reliable share of clients.

He works in diverse fields in the area. Since this activity does not provide him with enough stablility to pay his personal expenses and help his parents, he began additional work raising animals and selling wood.\r\n\r\nJuan buys carob trees recently felled from sellers in the area and cuts them into pieces to offer them to his customers in 30-unit \"armadas\" (bundles of wood). The business selling wood is useful in the area where he lives since the majority of families cook their food with this product. Additionaly, he raises animals in pens to sell them to vendors who visit the area.\r\n\r\nJuan has already had a loan financed by Kiva and, thanks to that money, he acquired more wood with which he was able to expand his business.

She earns her living by operating fishing and fish vending businesses. Her husband Benito, who is 45 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 15 and 24 years old. Isabelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Isabelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 to buy fishing gear and equipment so that she can continue to save up for education and home repairs. Isabelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Kanymkul sells six or seven liters of milk a day; in this way, she earns about 3,000 soms per month. \r\n\r\nKanymkul applied for the loan because she needs additional financial funds to increase the number of livestock.

She is 40 years old, married, and went to school until the 7th grade.  She is the mother of one son who is studying at the Pedagogical University in the Capital.\r\n\r\nLaurentina left Zavala with her parents who were serving in Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, since her father was an official of the local government.  Having arrived in Namaacha she did not have access to schooling due to a lack of documentation for transfers from one school to another so she went without.\r\n\r\nTime passed, and she became pregnant with her first and only child who was rejected by her boyfriend who alleged that the child she hoped to have did not belong to him.  Laurentina became desperate and asked for help from her father who gave her some funds.  She began her own business of selling empanadas on the black market.  With the funds collected she began to prepare food on the Swaziland border where there was a large flux of people.\r\n\r\nToday she is the owner of a food stand.  Every day she purchases 10 chickens at 100 each, 5kg of stomach at 50 per kg, and 5kg of beef at 95 per kg.  Each plate has a price.  For example, the chicken plate is 40MT per plate, and she can make 7 plates per chicken.  The beef and the stomach do not have exact numbers because it depends on the quality of the meat.\r\n\r\nShe sells 1,500MT on the normal days and 2,300MT on the busy days, but she is only able to save 500MT due to the expenses of her son, who is at the university, and her 2 employees.  One of her employees helps her in the stand earning 800MT, and the other helps at home earning 700MT monthly.\r\n\r\nThis is Laurentina's second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  This 10,000MT will be used to purchase more products since she is ready to open another food stand in the informal market, Shoprite, to resell staple products.  She is confident that she will be able to pay off the loan before the stipulated time and request another loan in order to furnish her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared

This place is known for its craftwork in weaving and also for archeological sites like Cauzhin and Tambo de Marivi\u00f1a, which attract national and foreign tourists alike. The community bank consists of a group of businesswomen who have forged a solid friendship while always looking to improve their families and community bank. Rosario C. is an active member of this community bank. She lives in Cumbe, is 54 years old, married and has three children, ages 33, 30 and 20. Her eldest daughter has her own family and lives at home, while the other two migrated abroad in search of better days for themselves and their parents. Her husband is a construction worker, and with everyone's efforts they were able to build their home. Rosario dedicates herself to households chores and also raises animals like chickens, guinea pigs, pigs, sheep and cows, which produce milk that she delivers to neighbors in her community. She raises the animals as much for her family to eat as to sell them. Rosario has 12 years' experience working with loans from Kiva partner Foundacion Espoir, and with them she has purchased her animals little by little. With the new loan she is requesting, she plans to purchase fertilizer and seeds for her animals' pastures.

Her home is located in Para\u00edso de Guayaquil.  She has been married for nine years.  Her husband works as a carpenter and construction worker.  They have a three year-old daughter.\r\n\r\nA year ago a friend invited her to sell Yanbal beauty products.  This allowed her to save up some money, which she invested in clothing, which she sold alongside the Yanbal items.  Adela now works anytime her customers request her products.  She sells perfumes, creams, lotions, clothing, and makeup.  One of her biggest complications is when her customers do not cancel orders in a timely manner and she must then pay for the items herself.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to invest in other Yanbal products and clothing in order to be able to offer a wider assortment.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to tmhe 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

One of them, Alejandro, lives with her. She let him have a part of her house, which is located in a neighborhood in the south of Lima. Since 1980, she has worked in a popular restaurant with her neighbor and partner. She works Monday through Fridays from 10:00 in the morning until 2:00 in the afternoon in a rented locale two blocks from her house. Seeing that her customers were looking for different culinary tastes, it became necessary to prepare different dishes at home. So, from 6:00 until 8:00 in the morning she cooks in order to offer these new dishes to those who wish for something different on the menu than what she normally offers. Later it is paid for with the earnings. She also sells cakes and other sweets and in this way obtains additional income. She likes to cook and she is very happy with the rythym of her work, besides the fact that it is profitable. Her wish is to be recognized for her work in culinary arts, because she plans on making it her profession and her only means of support. This will be her nineteenth loan with MFP and this whole time she has shown herself to be a very responsible person in making her payments. In addition, she acknowledges that she gets along well with the other members of her communal group. The loan that she is asking for will be for her to purchase products and ingredients to prepare her dishes.      <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":512592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Products and ingredients to continue preparing her dishes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-24T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":379.76},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":385.98},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":403.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":424.76},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":443.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":461.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.96},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.41},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.92},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.8},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":136.71,"local_amount":379.76,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":387.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993392},{"amount":138.96,"local_amount":385.98,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:03Z","rounded_local_amount":394.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718209},{"amount":624.33,"local_amount":1734.26,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1771.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751884}],"funded_date":"2010-03-27T04:58:17Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":192101,"name":"Nkeiruka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nkeiruka sells foodstuffs like garri (cassava flakes), rice, beans and yam flour.

The laws had recently changed, requiring fourplexes to have sprinkler systems installed.  \u201cThere were only five companies that did that between San Antonio, Laredo, and La Isla.  Only one company wanted to come look at my project.\u201d Due to the high demand of this sprinkler installation service and the low supply, companies could get away with overcharging. David decided that he would get certified to install sprinkler systems and charge this service for a more reasonable price. \r\n\r\nDavid says he charges about a third of what that company charged him for a comparable job. David and his 10 employees now install sprinkler systems and fire protection in private, commercial, and government buildings.\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenges in this industry are finding credit and funding everything up-front.  \u201cRight now my dream is just to survive.  \u2026It\u2019s very difficult to get credit, so you have to fund everything yourself.\u201d  David\u2019s clients do not pay him until the job is done, or up to 90 days later.  In the past, the people who sold the raw materials would take some of this risk by offering credit. \u201cBut now they don\u2019t have inventory\u2026 now you go to them and say \u201cI need this and this\u201d and they say \u2018good.  Pay me now, and I\u2019ll go get it for you.\u2019 So you become the financier for your clients.  Because you have to go buy the materials and then wait to be paid at the end of the job. You have to start with your money.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat is not the only reason the industry is so difficult, David says.  \u201cNone of the other companies want to help you.  \u2026They never tell you where to start if you want to get certified\u2026 and if anyone starts charging a cheaper rate, they start badmouthing them.  That way no one will contract them and the price never lowers.\u201d\r\n\r\nDavid is proud of his work.  \u201cWe\u2019ve done about 200 installations. About 99% of our clients are very happy and use us again or recommend us to others.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis loan will go to buy tubing and other raw materials in order to install sprinkler systems in a 12-story building in La Isla.  David needs to buy the materials up front, \u201cSo I\u2019m looking for credit anywhere I can.\u201d\r\n\u2003\r\nWithout this loan, David would have to hire fewer workers and take on smaller jobs.  David originally went to a bank, but they said they do not lend for this kind of loan. \u201cA loan to buy a house, yes.  But to buy raw materials?  Not one cent.\u201d \r\n\r\nDavid hopes that eventually he can get a larger loan or a revolving line of credit.  \r\n\r\nDavid supports his wife and two children with this company. He is from Mexico, but moved to the U.S. 20 years ago.  David describes himself as \u201ca person who wants to help the community but every day it\u2019s more difficult.\u201d  He advises other business owners \u201cdon\u2019t spend effort on superfluous

With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Avelina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000 to buy new tools and equipment to maintain her motorcycle so that she can continue to save up for future family needs.

This school was established in 2004\/2005 academic year. The school is staffed with 17 teachers and has an enrollment of over 600 pupils. \n\nAlimamy is the leader of this group of teachers. Born in Freetown, the 33 year old is married to a secretary and the couple has 1 child. Alimamy has requested for a loan of 1,000,000.00 SLL from SMT\/Kiva lenders in order to invest it in a business. He will use it to buy rice, palm-oil, etc. in large quantity for resale.  \n\nThis will be the first loan that teachers of this school are requesting from SMT\/Kiva lenders. This loan will certainly be of immense help to these teachers. Since salaries are usually small in Sierra Leone; especially so for people in the teaching profession, they could not use such salaries to buy or do anything great. But with a loan, they can now buy or do something big and then repay over a period of time.

She overcame her loss and has been selling her clothes in the markets of Masaya and the surrounding region in order to improve her family's quality of life. \r\nDo\u00f1a Ruth and Do\u00f1a Petrona began making clothing at an early age, inheriting the business from their parents.

In order to achieve this dream, they know that they have to manage their loan repayment well so that they become eligible for a larger one.\r\nThe group's members are from the same neighborhood and they support one another's work, helping each other out both with the production and the marketing of their clothing. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":242840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Nindiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.004722 -86.119444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2008-12-20T22:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dania ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrona Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":13076.44,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1452.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9891096},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14814371},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14814372},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349252},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-28T07:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349253},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T08:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27036648},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T08:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27036649},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927091},{"amount":72.24,"local_amount":1452.92,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1459.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927092}],"funded_date":"2008-12-21T04:51:55Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T09:34:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Sultan","image":null}},{"id":84746,"name":"Parveen Akhtar Mumtaz Ali Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Parveen akhtar baji is a 38 years old married woman.

de ciertos pa\u00edses sudamericanos), ella los alimenta con corteza de pl\u00e1tano y con chala (una variedad de sembr\u00edo de ma\u00edz utilizado como forraje para animales), su esposo trabaja eventualmente como pe\u00f3n agr\u00edcola y entre ambos tratan de sacar adelante su hogar.\n\nSu negocio ha ido creciendo y ahora tienen mas de un centenar de cuyes, pero lo que percibe por la venta no le alcanza para alimentarlos, por lo que est\u00e1 solicitando por tercera vez a nuestra Instituci\u00f3n un cr\u00e9dito de 1500 nuevos soles que le permita invertir en la alimentaci\u00f3n y sanidad de sus animales, por otro lado el creciente n\u00famero de ejemplares amerita el mantenimiento de las javas en las que viven.\n\nSu m\u00e1s grande anhelo es llegar a tener a largo plazo una granja de cuyes y tambi\u00e9n poder construir una casa propia.\n\nElla ya ha trabajado con nosotros anteriormente y ha demostrado puntualidad y responsabilidad en sus pagos, por lo que es considerada como una cliente excelente.","en":"Mar\u00eda is 21 years old, married, and has a 5 month old child.  She and her family live in the village of La Zaranda in the district of Pitipo, which is located 45 minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nFor a year and a half, she has been breeding and selling native guinea pigs (traditional domesticated animals in certain South American countries).  She feeds them banana tree bark and corn husks (from a variety of corn commonly used for animal fodder).  Her husband works as a farmhand.  They both try to succeed in their home life. \r\n<p>\r\nHer business has grown and now she has more than 100 guinea pigs.  However, her revenue is not enough to continue feeding them.  She is requesting her third loan from our Institution in the amount of 1500 soles so that she can invest in the nutrition and health of her animals.  Since the number of animals continues to increase, Mar\u00eda has paid more attention to maintaining the cages in which they live.\r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest dream is to continue her guinea pig farm for the long term and build her own house.  Mar\u00eda has worked with us previously and demonstrated her punctuality and responsibility with her payments.  She is considered to be an excellent client.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

One hundred percent of the inhabitants speak the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mixtec\" target=\"_blank\" >Mixtec<\/a> dialect.  Here we find the Tepetlapa Solidarity Group, which consists of five people and is led by Sra. Josefina T. L\u00f3pez.  She also serves as the translator for the group.\r\n<p>\r\nAll of the members are originally from San Antonio Tepetlapa and sell beef tamales and sweets.  Sra. Tomasa also sells freshly butchered chickens.  In addition to selling tamales, Sra. Josefina sometimes travels to Pinotepa to buy fresh fish and shrimp because those products are more readily available there.  It is quite a distance between Tepetlapa and Pinotepa, so the locals prefer to buy any seafood that she has available to sell.\r\n<p>\r\nSras. Tomasa G. G. and Catalina L\u00f3pez L\u00f3pez told us that they need to work because they are widows and the money they set aside for their children is not enough to cover their expenses.  It is even more difficult when they have to buy medicines because the prices are too high.  The other group members work in order to help their spouses with their children\u2019s expenses, such as their education, which can be excessive in most cases.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Josefina says they all enjoy working with the loans they receive from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad because it provides them with as much additional financing as possible to help them improve their families each day. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":421131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase ingredients & supplies for making tamales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SANTIAGO PINOTEPA NACIONAL","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2009-11-08T06:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4537.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4783.32},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4978.6},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5214.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5486.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":344.82},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":363.54},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.37},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.29},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":344.82,"local_amount":4537.17,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4581.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794847},{"amount":363.54,"local_amount":4783.32,"processed_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4829.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110686007},{"amount":378.37,"local_amount":4978.6,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5027.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080339},{"amount":396.29,"local_amount":5214.39,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5265.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123916662},{"amount":416.98,"local_amount":5486.52,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5539.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128952402}],"funded_date":"2009-11-09T03:04:53Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:06:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":154558,"name":"Angela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angela C. is now 48 years old.

They have helped each other to earn a living and finance the education of their children.\r\n\r\nFarming is the common source of their living; they plant rice and vegetables twice a year. Aside from this, Angela is engaged in rice retailing to earn additional income since harvesting takes a long time. She wants to sell more rice, but she has inadequate capital to do so.\r\n\r\nAngela would like to borrow Php 6,000 from Kiva lenders to acquire more rice to sell in their village since it is one of the basic commodities. She hopes that she can improve her small business and continue to support the schooling of their children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":429492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Para lograrlo quiere ir incorporando de a poco productos nuevos, por ejemplo su pr\u00f3xima meta es comprar una fotocopiadora. \nAdem\u00e1s tiene otras metas personales como sacar su 4\u00ba a\u00f1o de educaci\u00f3n media, lo cual est\u00e1 realizando este a\u00f1o en jornada vespertina, para as\u00ed m\u00e1s adelante estudiar una carrera. Su mayor sue\u00f1o es ser fuente de trabajo para otras personas como ella, con ganas de superarse. Su gran motivaci\u00f3n es su familia, sus dos hijas, de 11 y 2 a\u00f1os y su esposo que la apoya en todo.\nEsperanza siente que Fondo Esperanza significa un pilar muy importante para su desarrollo personal y estabilidad econ\u00f3mica y est\u00e1 muy agradecida de la facilidad con la cual ha obtenido sus cr\u00e9ditos.\nTemuco es la capital de la regi\u00f3n de la Araucan\u00eda. La ciudad se ubica a 670 kil\u00f3metros al sur de Santiago (capital de Chile) y posee una serie de balnearios lacustres y una flora y fauna nativa muy llamativas. Cabe destacar que en esta regi\u00f3n habita el 50% de los mapuches, pueblo ind\u00edgena, existente en nuestro pa\u00eds.\n\n\n\n","en":"The communal bank \"Avanzando Contigo\" is made up of 16 members from the city of Temuco.  They work mainly in the area of retail sales, including sales of used clothing, underwear, food according to the season of the year (for example, tamales), and catering.  Other members also attend to an internet cafe, make and repair shoes, and do embroidery.  \r\n\r\nThe member interviewed was Esperanza, who is the president of this group.  In the photograph she is found in the first row, crouching, with shoulder-length hair.  She has a deli (where she sells perishable and non-perishable food) in her house.  With the loan she wants to expand her business, since her dream is eventually have a mini-market where she can sell a large variety of products, including not only food but also office supplies.  To achieve this she wants to start gradually incorporating new products into her business.  For example, her next goal is to buy a photocopier.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she has other personal goals such as completing her last year of high school, which she is doing this year in the evenings, so that later on she can begin to study for an advanced degree.  Her main dream is to be a source of work for others like her who want to succeed.   Her greatest motivation is her family: her 2 daughters, aged 11 and 2, and her husband who supports her in everything.  \r\n\r\nEsperanza feels that the Fondo Esperanza supports her personal development and economic stability, and she is very grateful for the easy terms at which she has been able to access credit.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region.  The city is located 670 kilometers to the south of Santiago (the capital of Chile), and has number of lake resorts and colorful vegetation and wildlife.  It is worth highlighting that this region is where 50 percent of Chile's Mapuches (indigenous people) live. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

Domnic, from Nandihills, a remote town in Kenya, is an active and progressive farmer in his locality. He has a wife and together they live on a small piece of land. Traditionally, his primary source of income has been eggs, crops, a personal business, and he has been practicing farming for the past 42 years. \r\n\r\nHaving done farming for such a long time he has gained so much experience that he is always ranked the best farmer in his village. Domnic is respectfully seeking for a loan to buy a quality breed dairy cow. He has planted so many trees on his farm that food for the cattle will never be a problem. Marketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge, because he will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Domnic will not only benefit from milk, but will also benefit from manure (cow dung) that will be used in improving the fertility of his farm, thus saving money that would have been spent buying fertilizer. Domnic has been facing challenges in accessing finances, but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva, are there to make his dream come true. \r\n\r\nDomnic chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low and is on a reducing basis. Domnic underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and during the training season he learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. Through accumulated profits Domnic plans to permanently improve his living conditions, and to secure the future of his school-aged children by paying tuition fees for them. \r\n\r\nHe plans that through increased income, he will be able to buy more dairy cows and build a bio-gas digester in the future, and hence save costs incurred in buying fuel."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1863081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality breed dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domnic","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.34},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iris Belen","image":697625}},{"id":2818,"name":"Ophelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mothercare Hair Salon is a beauty care centre in the community of Christian Village.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n<p>\r\nOriginal French business description:\r\n<p>\r\n\u00abContexte : Le

This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

The loan will help him greatly by allowing him to provide a dignified and secure home for his family.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pamela Carre\u00f3n, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":242917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy construction materials to build a new roof","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Ricardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.22,"local_amount":444.44,"processed_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":449.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816797},{"amount":22.22,"local_amount":444.44,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":449.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351481},{"amount":22.22,"local_amount":444.44,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":449.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038819},{"amount":22.22,"local_amount":444.44,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":449.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929116},{"amount":45.25,"local_amount":904.95,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":914.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384029},{"amount":21.41,"local_amount":428.37,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":432.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111794},{"amount":22.22,"local_amount":444.44,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":449.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533219},{"amount":22.24,"local_amount":444.48,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":449.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964605}],"funded_date":"2009-01-03T04:42:43Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T09:51:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Carreon","image":90574}},{"id":84762,"name":"Chhoeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chhoeun T., 56, pictured with her husband and her children, is married and lives with her husband and four of her children in Bati district, Takeo province.

He has a nine-year-old child and is a single parent. He will use this loan to buy a few piglets, as well as vitamins, food, and serum to feed them and help them grow bigger. Some of the other group members also raise pigs, and others sell fruits or vegetables. Eusebio hopes his business will be profitable enough one day to allow him to repair his house. He works very hard and takes excellent care of the pigs he raises.

She is 56 years old. Omo is widowed and has 3 adult-aged children. To make a living, Omo owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling \"malong\" or tube skirts in the local community. Omo has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3000 Philippine pesos (about $62 US) a month for these activities.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2008, Omo joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Omo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 pesos from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Omo is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Omo from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<P>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<P>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<P>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is married, 37 years old and the mother of 3 children, two of whom still depend on her and are students.\r\n<p>\r\nMaril\u00fa has been selling groceries for 8 years, due to the necessity of increasing family income and the lack of work.  With her first loan of 300 new sols she decided to start her small business, obtaining very good results from the beginning, due to the quality of her products, her comfortable prices, and good customer service.\r\n<p>\r\nAt present, she continues the same business, located in her own house.  Her principal customers are her neighbors, friends, and residents of the city.  Also, in her free time, she sells cosmetics of different lines, such as Avon, Esika, or CyZone, and she tells us that this business is also doing very well.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of 800 new sols she will buy more products to add to her business; including rice, sugar in kilos, crates of eggs, items for personal hygiene and home cleaning, drinks in packets, sweets and other products to satisfy her customers.  Part of the money will be invested in purchasing beauty products, thus complementing her business.\r\n<p>\r\nToday she feels very happy about the work and service she offers and she thanks the Manuela Ramos Movement for helping people like her who wish to work and get ahead.  And she hopes that they will continue for a long time and aid many families and enterprising women. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Angelito L., a bus driver, and is the mother of a young boy now at preparatory school. By the grace of God, Gemma has managed to support her child's schooling and she is now working hard to be able to send him all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Gemma, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave their children.\r\n\r\nGemma maintains a direct sales business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct selling brands such as Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is paid for in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer, who has a one-month-to-pay credit. Since dealers\u2019 cost prices are lower than those in the catalog, they earn profit on the price difference. Gemma's regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 700 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Gemma is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan, which she will use to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.

Working seven days-a- week, and ten hours a day, he earns about Le 1,200,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Mohamed has already received, and successfully repaid three loans. He now requires a new loan in order to buy additional mini dresses, tan tops, and cotton shirts.

Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp. 500.000.-, Sapitriah bisa mendapat keuntungan Rp. 25.000.- per hari. Namun keuntungan itu harus disisihkan untuk membiayai hidupnya dan seorang anaknya uang berusia 5 tahun, sedangkan suaminya berprofesi sebagai pedagang sandal dan tas yang dipasarkan dengan cara berkeliling di sekitar lingkungan tempat tinggalnya atau di desa lainya.\r\nKarena menempati lokasi yang strategis, dagangan Sapitriah banyak dikunjungi oleh pelanggan. Namun karena keterbatasan modal, seringkali pelanggan tidak mendapat yang diinginkannya. Setelah mendapat pinjaman dana dari Dinari, Sapitriah menambah variasi dagangannya sehingga para pelanggan menjadi puas karena semua keinginannya bisa terpenuhi.

She faced many difficulties before joining the TYM fund because her husband had passed away early, leaving her with 2 small children. She made the first loan of 2,000,000 Vietnamese Dong to invest in the manufacturing of bricks. This business usually brings in 400,000 Vietnamese Dong per month. Until now, the family\u2019s main income still came from making bricks. The business has since expanded and she can now hire another worker. To increase her moneymaking prospects, she raises pigs, chickens, and fish. She plans to make the next loan of 15,000,000 Vietnamese Dong to buy supplies and food for the animals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Duc Tran, Kiva

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
