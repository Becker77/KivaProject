In addition to the loan, and this small business, she also sells fruits and vegetables in the Leon bus terminal market, as these are products her husband grows.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets. Women are considered non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This situation leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":270217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase hair products and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-12T00:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Eva J.

She is 32 years old and the leader of a six-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Elizabeth P.'s group.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, she runs a general store selling a variety of different products. She has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Elizabeth joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She successfully repaid a previous loan of 19000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elizabeth is requesting a new loan of 19000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Elizabeth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

He is 38 years old. Quirwin is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Quirwin raises crops. The main source of income for his business comes from planting and harvesting corn for sale. Quirwin has been engaged in his business for more than two years and earns approximately 8,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Quirwin joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Quirwin has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from GDMPC, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. \r\n\r\nQuirwin is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the third loan taken out by Quirwin from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small-scale entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

They tell us that they named it thus because most of the members live in a place called Flores Mag\u00f3n.  The group is located in the town of Zit\u00e1cuaro in the state of Michoac\u00e1n.  It has 11 members.\r\n\r\nThe group representative is Mar\u00eda Socorro S. D\u00edaz.  Do\u00f1a Soco, as her family and acquaintances call her, is 43 years old.  She studied to be an Executive Secretary but says that she never practiced her profession because she married very young and her husband didn\u2019t let her work so that she could dedicate herself totally to home and children.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Soco is a very hard working woman.  Her husband realized in time that what he earned wasn\u2019t sufficient to support the family so she decided to help him with household expenses and started her plastics business.  Now, both of them sell plastic bags, drinking glasses, Styrofoam dishes, spoons, forks, etc.  She tells us that her customers are people who have stands in the market, tortilla makers and bakers.  She has been in this business for 7 years and has her plastics stand outside the Zit\u00e1cuaro, Michoac\u00e1n market where she also sells women\u2019s underwear and crafts like bathroom sets, napkins, decorated purses, etc.\r\n\r\nSocorro has been married to Mario for 22 years and they have three daughters:  Marisol, 22, Stephanie, 19, both married, and Carol, 17 who is studying to be a teacher at the Zit\u00e1cuaro Normal School.  Socorro hopes that her youngest daughter finishes her career because she says that\u2019s the best inheritance a parent can leave her children.\r\n\r\nRoci\u00f3 Sanrom\u00e1n M., 29, is also part of the \u201cFlores Mag\u00f3n\u201d group.  She is currently finishing high school in the Open High School program because her parents couldn\u2019t afford to buy her uniforms and school supplies back when she was in regular school.  She says her husband is a great help to her because he encourages her to continue forward and study a career.  Do\u00f1a Rosi, as her friends and family refer to her, sells candies, juices, chicharrones (made from soy), soft-drinks, snacks, popsicles, etc. in front of the Zit\u00e1cuaro Regional Hospital.  \r\n\r\nShe has had the business for two years.  She comments that she started selling juices and other items because she noticed that family members of patients in the hospital didn\u2019t have anything to eat at lunch so she decided to set up her stand.  Another motive behind her doing this is that she wanted to help her husband meet household expenses.\r\n\r\nRosi is married to Salvador, who is an attorney, and they have a six year old daughter named Leylan who is in first grade.\r\n\r\nRosi says that her life goal is to have a stable location where she can sell her candy and also sell costume jewelry because she likes to design jeweled necklaces and bracelets.  Another one of her goals is to finish high school and then complete a career in Law.\r\n\r\nShe says that profits from the candy and juice sales will be to buy the lot to build the locale she so dreams of.\r\n\r\nThe other nine group members are: Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Juli\u00e1n C., Reyna P. E., Isabel M. Garc\u00eda, Clementina Sol\u00eds S., Stephanie Sanrom\u00e1n S., Teresa L\u00f3pez P., Perla Janeth M. L\u00f3pez Azucena Juli\u00e1n C. and Mar\u00eda Amparo S. N..  They want the loans to invest in several lines of work: catalogue bedspread sales, candy sales, catalogue shoe sales, arts and crafts, bakery, catalogue cosmetics sales, etc.\r\n<br

That\u2019s why she decided to use her small savings to buy a cart which allows the mobile preparation of \u201csalchipapas\u201d (sausages and fried potatoes).  This is giving her very good results since it provides her the income she needs to live.  What she likes most about her new work is that she has the morning free in order to be able to care for her dear son.  She has been in this business for 6 months and feels that the most difficult part is having to stay in the streets selling until very late at night.  With the passage of time she hopes to be able to purchase more equipment for her cart in order to be able to sell other, additional dishes.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Maisa\u2019s fourth loan with MFP, and, just as she did with her prior loans, she hopes to be able to make her payments on time.

To make a living, Jovelyn owns and operates a business venture in the food sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling of fruits and vegetables in the local community. Jovelyn has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Jovelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jovelyn is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Jovelyn from ASKI.

This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase fish so that she can continue to save up for future repairs for the house and for her children's school fees. \r\n\r\nLudivina C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: Barter\/buying and selling of rice, fish vending and food vending. Her husband Antonio, who is 52 years old, earns his living as a laborer in a sugarcane field.  They have two children who are 14 and 17 years old. Morena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Morena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000 to use as funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for her children's education and family needs. Morena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

All the members live in the community of Independencia, in the city of Santiago.\r\n\r\nLorena, a member of the communal bank, is in the photo on the right edge with blond hair, wearing a gold jacket. She has been a beautician for 19 years. For 10 years, she worked as an employee but with the birth of her daughters, she began to work independently from home. Lorena's work schedule is Monday through Saturday, and she sometimes works on Sundays, when her customers request her hair services. Her salon is located in a room in the interior of her house, where Lorena only attends to known customers. Here she has all the equipment for her shop. She buys her merchandise from a distributor who sells specific cosmetology and hair products.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Lorena will buy a professional hair dryer plus professional cosmetology products. \r\n\r\nHer goals are to install her beauty salon in an established and more ample space so that she can attend to a larger number of customers. Also Lorena  would like to supply her salon with more innovative products for this area. Lorena lives with her husband and 2 children aged 12 and 9, plus her mother. One of her dreams has been to obtain her own house and, fortunately, during the month of December she obtained her own home. \r\n\r\nLorena is very content and grateful for the services offered by Fondo Eslperanza. She comments that in addition to enjoying the meetings very much, she has learned a great deal, and has gotten to know the other members, plus enjoyed having a place to relax.\r\n\r\nIndependencia is one of the 34 neighborhoods that make up the city of Santiago (Chile's capital).

Chile (Chilean Indigenous Cultural Center) is located here. It also has important historical monuments, among them 6 of Chile's historical monuments.     \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":868625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy a professional hair dryer, plus cosmetology products for  the hair for her beauty salon.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Independencia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-09-15T22:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3700,"lender_count":131,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeannette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Johanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shirley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Myriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pabla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1703400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":116468},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":115247},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":116351},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":117470},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":118592},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":119716},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120857},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":122011},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":122146},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125209},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":125545},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":126739},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":127960},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":129089}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.98},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.73},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.16},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.6},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":260.04},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.51},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":265.03},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":265.31},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.97},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.7},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275.3},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":277.94},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":280.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1011.2,"local_amount":465536,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:00:19Z","rounded_local_amount":467782.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232796001},{"amount":1045.18,"local_amount":481176,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:11:46Z","rounded_local_amount":483498.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238606922},{"amount":1363.22,"local_amount":627599,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:34Z","rounded_local_amount":630628.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244561290},{"amount":280.4,"local_amount":129089,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":129712.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250772285}],"funded_date":"2011-09-16T10:04:17Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":339312,"name":"Regina  Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Regina is 45 years old and lives in Senor, Sinaaacaban, Misamis Occidental.

However, since the sinking of the Joola [note: the Joola was the original ship that used to make a stop at Carabane on its way between Dakar and Ziguinchor, however after a tragic accident which resulted in the sinking of the Joola, the stops at Carabane were discontinued] we established our business at the port, where we market local products that we purchase in the villages. <p>\r\n\r\nOur objective is to sell the greatest possible quantity of the seafood and forest products of the local villages, in order to earn enough money to fulfill our needs, and to improve our sources of income in order to pay for our children\u2019s schooling.  Our business will consist of purchasing and reselling a large quantity of seafood and forest products, as well as small-scale retail trade of various merchandise.  It is for this purpose that we are requesting a loan of 600,000 francs in order to launch this enterprise on a large scale.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French: <p>\r\n\r\n\u00ab Contexte du Projet : Nous habitons une zone enclav\u00e9e qui re\u00e7oit beaucoup de touristes et de passagers venants des \u00eeles voisines pour prendre le bateau qui fait la liaison Dakar Ziguinchor.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":6868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing seafood and other village products; transportation to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Carabane","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.533333 -16.716667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-12-09T01:33:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Binta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-24T17:24:41Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1175,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":106,"local_amount":106,"processed_date":"2007-03-23T04:40:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":11572},{"amount":106,"local_amount":106,"processed_date":"2007-04-16T22:12:13Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13123},{"amount":142,"local_amount":142,"processed_date":"2007-05-10T09:15:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":142,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15789},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T20:42:20Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34425},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T04:03:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41455},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:04:55Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50196},{"amount":534,"local_amount":534,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:41:00Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":534,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63342}],"funded_date":"2006-12-10T17:24:41Z","paid_date":"2007-10-06T00:41:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":6,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6574,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicky is 28 years old and a mother of 2.

H. is 57 years old and married. He has two children, who are 18 and 19 years old. Both children are in their first year of university. Lenuel's wife works as a domestic servant, and he runs a welding business from his home. Lenuel's goal is to improve the infrastructure of his business, because his shop is the main source of income for the family. Lenuel's greatest dream is for his children to complete their professional education.

He lives in Senegal, and has lived there since he was young.  He works in transportation, and has been driving a small public transportation bus for seven years.  He chose this profession because he always dreamed of owning his own transportation vehicle.  For him, the best part is the profitable aspect of the business, which enables him to meet his personal needs.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.

Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

This is 47-yea-old Anna M. from Mbeya. She is widowed with 3 children between the ages of 13 and 24. Anna has been running a local restaurant known as \u201cmamalishe\u201d since 1989. \r\n\r\nWhen you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough made from maize flour), plantain (a savory cooked banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.\r\n\r\nShe works at her business for 9 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Anna currently earns about $120 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $375 USD to purchase foods like rice beans, potatoes,cooking oil and other items for her business. In the future, she plans to increase number and varieties of services in her restaurant . Anna thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase food and other items for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-14T00:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna E.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At the weekends Hugo works in his fields, while from Monday to Friday he drives a heavy-duty truck for a mining company.\r\n\r\nThanks to his wife\u2019s hard work, his fields produce a good crop of beans, corn, potatoes and peas. For the last twenty years she has tended these crops and at the same time has never neglected her household duties. \r\n\r\nHugo\u2019s greatest pleasure is picking the ripe beans which he then parboils with salt and enjoys them as if they were a true delicacy. His work as a farmer is profitable and he can cover the household costs with the money he earns. \r\n\r\nIn the future he would like to buy more land and increase production.

It is also known for its wood, ceramic, and reed handicrafts.

He has 13 cows, and 6 of them produce milk daily.  His stable is a half hour from his house.  He goes there very early everyday to milk the cows.  He sells the milk to a wholesaler in the area. \r\n\r\nAs this activity is his only source of income, Pablo always feeds his livestock well and takes good care of them.  He now wants to get balanced nutritional feed and natural grass to improve the milk production of his cows.  That is why he has requested a loan for 1,000 PEN from Edypme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nPablo is a family man who really likes the work he does.  He has always counted on it to get ahead.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: hog raising, running a general store, and managing a sugarcane plantation. Her husband Francisco, who is 52 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps with his wife\u2019s business activities. They have four children who are between 24 to 32 years old. All of them have family of their own.  \r\n\r\nJosephine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Josephine has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 21,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,000 PHP and uplifted the family\u2019s standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP to buy feed and fertilizer to continue to save for the future expansion of her hog raising business. Josephine is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through its alleviation program, NWTF is empowering women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":269766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase the capital by purchasing more crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-14T00:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Upendo I.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History <p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

If she is not contented with her daily sales turnover in the market, she goes to other municipalities on their scheduled market day to sell.<p>\r\n\r\nWithout much training, Sherly has able to develop an entrepreneurial skill and attitude within herself through practical experience, just like other poor women. She is determined to change their standard of living so that her 17-year-old only child can graduate from college. She will never surrender to the challenges poverty will bring her. Through loans she can access from ASHI and KIVA, she will be have an opportunity to grow and expand her hog fattening business until she has a

She lives together with her husband, who works as a trader for various products, which he markets door to door. She also lives together with her two small children, 3 and 2 years of age. Marlene sells many products such as batteries, combs, hair clips and other things. She and her husband are actually passing through a difficult moment as they don't have some basic home services such as water and light, owing to the fact that they don't have the necessary capital to buy them. It is for this reason that Marlene is seeking a loan, with which she can expand her inventory with products such as lamps, calculators, radios and more. These will help them during the Christmas period as their sales can be very good and they can augment their earnings, which she greatly desires and hopes to be able to improve her family situation.

She lives at her sister\u2019s house, which is located in the District of M\u00f3rrope.  The inhabitants of this district mostly live in rural areas and can be found in the Province of Lambayeque, which is 30 minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.  \r\n<p>\r\nLindaura needed for her children to get ahead, so she started a business a year ago of raising and selling guinea pigs.  She keeps them in cages that she stores at the back of her home and sells them to dealers who frequent the area.  Prior to this business, she worked as a farm laborer but the need to obtain a stable source of income made her gradually devote more to time to raising guinea pigs.  Within a year, her business has grown considerably and she has plans to invest the earnings into building new cages.  \r\n<p>\r\nLindaura wants to buy more feed to improve the quality of her animals.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan from Edpymne Alternativa in the amount of 1500 PEN in order to meet this objective.  Lindaura is a responsible and determined woman.

Ruth has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Ruth joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ruth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Ruth is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional goats to raise. This will be the third loan taken out by Ruth from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She plans to open a chicken shop with her sister; she\u2019s been planning this for quite some time.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about the communal bank is the unity among the members and the ease of the loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":778483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cologne, jewelry and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T01:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ambrosia Nicolasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:27:48Z","rounded_local_amount":188.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216543914},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":188.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221712433},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":188.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227082808},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":188.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232844435}],"funded_date":"2011-05-29T23:17:08Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:41:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":306560,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene is married with seven children, four of whom are in school.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. \n\nThe amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She lives with her husband and children in the home they own, where they have a small convenience store. For the past 6 years she has sold different products to meet the demand in her neighborhood, which is heavy since her store is the closest one in the area. Liz usually works alone, but when she has to go our to buy more goods her children help out. She likes her work because she can do it from home and she is comfortable selling there. Unfortunately sometimes it is tiring as she has to open at 6 in the morning and stay open until 9 or 10 at night, which makes for a long day. However, thanks to her neighbors who always visit the store, she can chat with them while she works. Liz hopes to expand her business and to keep buying more goods. She has had 16 loans with Microfinanzas PRISMA and each loan has helped to to get ahead bit by bit. Also, working with her communal bank has been good and she is pleased to be part of the group.

After successfully selling some of their property, they bought a cow and a calf. They took a risk to put in $625, which was quite a large sum of money at that time. Now, they have turned it into a monthly income of $100. By means of saving money, they have obtained some necessary equipment for her husband\u2019s work and a car.\r\n\r\nZamira and her husband need a loan to buy another cow. This would enable them breed their cattle and increase its population. \r\n\r\n\"Everything we do, we do for the sake of our children. Our son is growing up. Very soon, he will be going to school. So we need to purchase everything needed for his education, including stationary and (a) school uniform,\" says Zamira.\r\n\r\nTaalaibek, Suyorbubu and Kayir are in the same group with Zamira. Taalaibek is 40. He is married and has three children. Taalaibek provides for his family by collecting milk from local villagers and producing milk products. He sells these products in the city of Alma Ata. He needs a loan to purchase sheep and cows and to increase turnover. \r\n\r\nKayir is 44. She sells yogurt that she produces from her cow\u2019s milk, or from milk that she buys from other villagers. She urgently needs a new fridge to put the milk products in since the old one cannot contain all of her products. She cannot buy a fridge unless she obtains a loan. \r\n\r\nSuyorbubu is a housewife. She keeps a cow and sells milk. Some years ago she obtained a loan and bought a car. Since then, by selling milk she has managed to save enough money to buy new furniture for her son. She wants to obtain a loan to purchase calves and feed for them. After fattening them up, she is going to resell them. \r\n\r\n\"Even though raising livestock requires certain amount of efforts, it is not that troublesome. In a rural area like ours, it is the most convenient business,\" says Suyorbubu with enthusiasm.  \r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the three Ps concept: people (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the planet (taking care of the environment).
