It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Many head of cattle have passed through her care. \r\n\r\nNowadays she owns a cow with a calf. It yields fresh milk every morning which she distributes to her regular customers. Buraima remembers how, being a young lady in 1971, she started with the purchase of her first cow, in which she put big hopes, and spent the last savings in her family budget. At that time, she and her husband were a young couple and her husband was farmer. Since that time, milk products bring in a significant portion of Buraima\u2019s income. \r\n\r\nThanks to those financial assets, she raised three kids, helped with their employment and finished major repairing at her house. She invests her monthly income of about $215 back into her business. This time she needs some financial assistance in purchasing one more cow.

Nana\u2019s husband works in the family-owned cornfield, where 2 - 3 tonnes of maize are harvested for the season. The total harvest is used on the farm for feeding the animals. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan, Nana plans to purchase construction materials for a new cattle shed. The existing one is already too small and doesn\u2019t allow Nana to plan future expansion of the family\u2019s farming activities.

For lack of adequate working capital, Millicent buys a few stocks of lace materials and garment cloth and sells through hawking.

","en":"Ra\u00fal is 27 years old, is a calm and responsible man, and lives with the mother of his only son in his aunt\u2019s house. Since he was a child, he has worked in agriculture and has taken care of his plants. Now, he and his partner have decided to work together because they want to go forward by means of their crops. For this, they have rented farms, where they will sow potatoes and peas. They will pay between 280 and 340 soles for each planting. At the same time, they have joined the community lands so that in later years they will be able to become co-proprietors. Ra\u00fal is very happy with his agricultural work. For this, he wakes up very early so that at 8 in the morning he can begin his work, and he catches up with his wife at lunch. To achieve very good harvests this season, he hopes to have the opportunity to buy land that is easily accessible by cars, so that he can avoid transportation work during the harvest months. Though he joined later, his peers at the community bank got their ninth loan from MFP. For this, his fifth loan, he will continue paying his installments punctually. The money he is requesting will be invested to buy chemical fertilizers for his potato crop. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":352149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-14T17:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ra\u00fal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734037}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T03:42:41Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":125834,"name":"William De Los Reyes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or William S\u00e1nchez M. tiene  37 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y actualmente tiene un hijo el cual es menor de edad.

He is a hardworking man who lives with his wife, Cledina, who is 33 years old and with whom he has 2 children. They all live together in their own house, in the town of Patay. He has been working in agriculture for more than 13 years, planting potatoes and peas on some pieces of land he owns. Generally his wife is in charge of the domestic work and caring for their children. \r\n\r\nWhat Delbor likes most is cultivating potatoes and watching them as they grow because he is very careful with his crops; he is certain that taking good care of the land is the key to having successful harvests. On the other hand, he dislikes fighting against the climatic variations. The wind and the rain are very strong and they don\u2019t let the plants develop normally. He is steadfast and continues in his work because he finds his work profitable since it allows him to cover educating his children, the costs of his household, and to save to buy more land so he can plant more. He has also been able to open a small grocery store in his house. \r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan with MFP, and he is happy to continue working with the members of his communal bank, who all work actively. With his loan he plans to buy several sacks of organic fertilizer for his next planting. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":580478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of organic fertilizer.

Bernadette has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Bernadette is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Bernadette from ASKI.

","en":"Irene is a native of the state of Michoac\u00e1n. She is 58 years old and has a fifth-grade education. She says she stopped going to school because her parents didn't want her to continue her education due to a lack of financial resources because she had many siblings and they couldn't afford to buy books. Irene is married to Pedro, who makes a living as a construction worker. They have seven children, of which two live with them: Guadalupe, 21, and Tomasa, 12, who is in school. Irene runs a convenience store out of her home and makes a living selling ornamental flowers, avocados and chili peppers, since she has a garden and a nursery. She goes out on boats to sell them to suppliers in the city of Zitacuaro, and almost always what she sells is on order from customers. Irene is requesting the loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad to purchase eggs, sugar, soups, beans and other products of more primary need. She says that previously she made a living on selling seasonal fruits and legumes in the regional street markets but for health reasons she decided to open a store out of her home since her back and bones ached out of the effort from loading the very heavy cargo into the boats. She says that she and her clients are going to benefit from the loan because they won't go to other, more remote stores and will be able to find everything they need in her store. Irene will also be able to sell her avocados and chili peppers out of her home. Her goal is to expand her garden of avocados and chili peppers and also stock her store with products so that her local customers don't have to travel to Zitacuaro or have travel expenses. Irene says that her store is going very well and that her avocado and chili pepper sales are gaining customers in her area. She says with the earnings she makes she will paint and remodel her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":720317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase supplies to stock her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-03-09T03:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":432.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":465.23},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":475.27},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":485.52},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":496},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":506.7},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":517.63},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":528.8},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":540.21},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":551.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.79},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.54},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.4},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.16},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.07},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.94},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":76.33,"local_amount":898.01,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":923.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292471},{"amount":81.67,"local_amount":961.01,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":988.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160729},{"amount":85.23,"local_amount":1002.48,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1031.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233603},{"amount":181.77,"local_amount":2138.5,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2200.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512428}],"funded_date":"2011-03-09T09:08:31Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":282391,"name":"Jaqueline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacqueline is 49 years old and is married with three children.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling animal feed and farm-related products in the local community. Anecita has been engaged in this business for over 14 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Anecita joined NWTF to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anecita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 19,000 PHP from NWTF. Anecita is now requesting a new loan of 19,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be her 17th loan taken out from NWTF. Anecita plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc., has answered the calls of not just of a few but thousands of women.

He has a business selling metal boxes and other items to the local people for the past two years. He says that this business is profitable and the only major challenges he has are that there are very many people in the area doing the same kind of business as his, hence customers are spoiled for choice, and high prices of raw materials. However, he works very hard to keep his business doing well. \r\n\r\nMutunga is using his loan of Kes 50,000 to buy more scrap metal to make the metal boxes to sell.

Socorro is the group leader of a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMa. Socorro is 37 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Ma. Socorro owns and operates a  general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Ma. Socorro is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ma. Socorro joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ma. Socorro has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Ma. Socorro is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be Ma. Socorro's second loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherpeople, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":664713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Carabatan Chica, Cauayan City, Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2010-12-14T20:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

In order to properly care for her family, she left her job teaching pre-school, where she cared for children under 5 years old.  Her husband works for the local government as an agricultural engineer for rural development projects.  Aware of the expenses she caused in leaving her job, she opened a small bookstore in her house where she sells paper, pens, notebooks, and other desk supplies.  However, she is most passionate about farming.  She grows coffee, which she harvests once a year, on her four hectares of farmland and later sells the grains to the Sanchirio Palomar area cooperative through her father, who is one of the members of the cooperative.  Now she wants to improve her production and continue progressing with her business.  She belongs to the Desarrollando para el Progreso de Prisma Communal Bank and this is her first loan with MFP, where she is sure that she will meet her goals.  Lizet is getting ready for the school year and her coffee harvest.  For this reason, she plans to use the loan to purchase organic manure, office supplies, and use the rest to pay the farm workers that she will hire to collect the first coffee beans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":732658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy school items and materials to sell for the school year, as well as to hire workers to pick coffee beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-17T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lizet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1038,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850706}],"funded_date":"2011-03-17T19:07:50Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen O'Connell","image":578556}},{"id":286506,"name":"Olive","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olive M. is 25 years old, married to a barber and has two children who are three years old and two months old.

She tells us that her business is going very well because she has good customers who come to her for the good service that she provides and for her good work.  She would like to continue stocking her business and so is requesting a loan to buy clothing and tools which she needs for her blacksmith's such as iron, sheets of metal, paints, etc.  She is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya and Kiva for the opportunity that they are giving her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":905826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy iron, sheets of metal, paint and other products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ciudad del Este","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.516667 -54.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2011-11-04T11:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leidy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelaida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Johana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernarda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Germania ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Digna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Liliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":13544535,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2257423},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2257423},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2257423},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2257423},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2257423},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2257420}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":541.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":541.67,"local_amount":2257423,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2266875.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244571014},{"amount":541.66,"local_amount":2257423,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2266875.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250782319},{"amount":541.67,"local_amount":2257423,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2266875.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257190763},{"amount":541.67,"local_amount":2257423,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2266875.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263326992},{"amount":541.66,"local_amount":2257423,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2266875.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270041093},{"amount":541.67,"local_amount":2257420,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2266872.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276653263}],"funded_date":"2011-11-09T08:39:07Z","paid_date":"2012-05-16T08:31:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":356206,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is 50 years old and lives in Canubay, Oroquieta City.

She has been selling Oriental style jewelry at the local market for the past 11 years. The national earrings, rings and bracelets she sells are very beautiful and popular in Tajikistan. All Tajik women have at least one set of jewelry, often inherited from their grandmothers. <P>\r\n\r\nGulmira\u2019s jewelry business is successful and generates a stable income for her family.  She started out with $300 USD and now has $3000 USD in working capital.  She requests a loan of $1200 USD to purchase new jewelry and increase the range of items she sells. Gulmira has demonstrated herself as a reliable IMON borrower over the past two years. She thanks all for the support and promises to repay the loan. <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:<P> \r\n\r\n<B>Tajikistan<\/B><P>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\n<B>IMON's History<\/B><P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they

She earns her living by operating three trisikads. For those of you that do not know what a trisikad is, allow me to shed some light for you. A trisikad is a typical means of transportation in the Philippines. It is a BMX bike with a small sidecar attached. Inside is a padded seat big enough to fit two (though as many as five people can fit on a trisikad at one time). This is different from a tricycle which is a motorbike with a sidecar attached.\r\n\r\nLeonora owns three trisikads, all of which are used to generate income for her family. Leonora\u2019s husband, Raul, also helps run the business. They have two children ages 21 and 27 years old. The two children work and help the family financially. Leonora wants to buy another trisikad and expand her business. This is a great opportunity for you to help a Kiva borrower expand her business.\r\n\r\nLeonora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in March of 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income, earning an extra 4,800 Philippine pesos (PHP) from her business activities.\r\n\r\nLeonora is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of 14,000 PHP was used to fund the operations of her trisikad business and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is requesting her 17th loan, for 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy a trisikad. Leonora is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":475994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

Mavjuda is 35 years old. She is married and the mother of 3 children. Mavjuda's lack of a stable job and the slow productivity of her husband's business as an independent constructor didn't leave enough money to pay the expenses of the family. \r\n\r\nThis was the reason that Mavjuda decided to start her own business 18 years ago. She sells the fabric used to make their national dresses. Little by little, she has made her business grow and, by allowing her clients to pay in installments, her orders are getting bigger. Now her business is running normally. However, she would like to continue improving herself (and her business) so her situation will be stable in the future. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan of 3800 Somoni ($1125 USD) that she will pay back in 9 months. With this money, Mavjuda will be able to buy seasonal fabrics for the national dresses. The power to help her business grow is in your hands. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her objectives are to increase the inventory of her sales and to support her daughter in her studies.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":259098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy construction materials to build a porch\/Comprar materiales de construccion para hacer un porche","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1416.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1416.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1416.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1416.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1416.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1416.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1416.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1416.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1416.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1416.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1416.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1416.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.51,"local_amount":1430.16,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1441.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351590},{"amount":70.53,"local_amount":1410.6,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1422.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038928},{"amount":74.98,"local_amount":1499.64,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1511.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929223},{"amount":68.32,"local_amount":1366.43,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1377.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384134},{"amount":70.21,"local_amount":1404.29,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:33:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1415.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890596},{"amount":73.12,"local_amount":1462.5,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1474.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111895},{"amount":71.49,"local_amount":1429.73,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1441.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533307},{"amount":71.82,"local_amount":1436.49,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T10:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1448.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964685},{"amount":70.89,"local_amount":1417.79,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:55:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1429.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875151},{"amount":207.13,"local_amount":4142.37,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4176.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713124}],"funded_date":"2009-02-13T21:00:42Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T10:45:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Liz Harvey","image":null}},{"id":89018,"name":"Mwajuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings!) from Tanzania!

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":271544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing cosmetics in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T15:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Mwajuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130785},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027574},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:21Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613575},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010654},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232940},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664732}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T16:34:22Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susanna Heinz","image":1284039}},{"id":93114,"name":"Medelii A Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janeth C. has been a cement seller in the Ipagala neighborhood of Dodoma for one year.

She is a married woman with three children. Currently all of her children are in school. She lives with her family at Sefwi Wiawso, in the western region of Ghana. She has been a baker, using flour for her production, for ten years now.  In spite of the challenges she faces, she bakes bread, cake, meat pie, chips, etc. and retails them to her customers.

The residents of the area are engaged primarily in agriculture and animal husbandry.  There are factories that produce candles, hats and industrial machinery, and provide work to anyone who wants a manufacturing job similar to those found in larger cities.  Children spend most of their time inside because of the unevenness of the land and the strong winds that blow all day long.   This group consists of 12 women, all of whom are organized and well-mannered.  They are devoted to different business activities, carried out both within and outside of the home.  Here are some examples:\r\n<p>\r\n<b> Sra. C. I. Blanca Celestina<\/b>:  Blanca is 27 years old, married, and has three children (ages 9, 7, and 1).  The two oldest children attend school in the Yanaturo area.  Her husband works in the city as a jeweler.  The communal bank gathers at her house every 15 days for their meetings because she is the group president.  She currently leases her home, but will own it outright in about two months when she completes the payments.  During the week, Blanca spends most of her time on household chores.  On the weekends or whenever people ask her, she prepares food at her customer\u2019s house or in her own home.  She learned to cook about 10 years ago when she worked at a restaurant called <i> Balc\u00f3n Cuencano<\/i>.   Everything she makes is well received because the food is quite tasty.  \r\n<p>\r\nBlanca is requesting a loan of $440 USD from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR to buy pots, industrial kitchenware, and other materials needed for her work.  Her future goal is to finish her house payments and, at the same time, open a restaurant.\r\n<p>\r\n<b> Sra. C. Guam\u00e1n Cecilia Del Roc\u00edo<\/b>:  Cecilia is a native of East Puyo, Ecuador and has lived in Cuenca 23 years.  Her husband is 33 years old and also from Puyo.  They have four children (ages 15, 10, 8 and 3).  The first three children are students, one in high school and the other two in elementary school.  Cecilia spends her time sewing, which she has been doing for about 4 months.  She is not a professional yet, but is still learning.  Sra. Cecilia works with Sra. Pilar S., who is also a communal bank member, and asked to be part of the group.  Her first loan was very beneficial because she used her $330 to buy a sewing machine and fabric.  Although not yet known for her work, she is learning from Do\u00f1a Pilar how to make trousers, blouses, dresses, and sportswear.  She needs to purchase lycra fabric, which costs $5.80 per yard.  Her work schedule runs between 8am-12pm and 2pm-5pm.  She also works on the weekends during the morning.  She is able to get much accomplished on the weekends because her husband helps with the household chores.  He works as a company driver and is off on the weekends.  Cecilia\u2019s goal is to continue learning her craft and open a workshop in her home.\r\n<p>\r\n<b> Sra. I. Zumba Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngeles<\/b>:  Mar\u00eda is 55 years old, married and has 12 children between the ages of 10 and 20.  She doesn\u2019t remember the exact ages of each of them.  Four of them are in high school, three are in elementary school, and the older ones are working and married.  She lives in a rented house because her family cannot complete the construction on their own.  Her husband is a farmer, and when he is not working, he helps around the house.  She spends her time performing household chores (including washing clothes), raising animals, and cultivating crops.  Starting on Thursdays and through the weekend, she washes clothes for neighbors.  She charges $1 per dozen garments, $0.50 for blankets, and $0.25 for jackets.   Mar\u00eda is a native of Santa Ana, which is a parish in Cuenca.  She has lived in Yanaturo for 18 years.  She will use her loan of $330 to buy livestock that she will yoke together to plow her fields.  She plans to fight through life\u2019s struggles and hopes to own a house so that she can rest peacefully and not have to worry about the rent each month.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br

She is a fighter with a lot of dreams.  She lives in her own house together with her 34-year-old husband, Teofilo, and their three children, who are her reason for living.  Together with her husband, she has spent the last 14 years growing potatoes, gladiolas, peas, and corn on their own property as well as rented land.  During harvest time, the couple contracts operators to speed up the work, but Nancy is always responsible for taking care of the land since she likes to plant peas and gladiolas, two products in high demand at her local markets.  It inconveniences her to pull out the bad grass that invades her farm land but she takes the extra time to do so since it is necessary to keep the land clean.  \r\n\r\nThese past few months, Nancy's husband has learned to make doors, windows, and metal furniture, which is a very profitable business.  For this reason, the couple wants to install a metallurgy shop in their home.  Nancy also wants to open a business selling non-perishable foods while still tending to her agricultural projects.\r\n\r\nThis is Nancy's fourth loan with MFP.  She says she enjoys working with a community brink because she works with responsible, honest, hard-working people like herself.

They reside in their own home in the town of Santa Rosa, which is located in the beautiful Ayacucho jungle.  Nery says she sells cacao because it is quite profitable, so she tries to provide her crops the best care.  She has many buyers who are satisfied with the quality of her product, so she strives to achieve this result as often as possible.  Nery devotes much of her time to growing cacao and has the help of her husband.  During the harvest season, she needs to hire laborers to facilitate the extraction of the cacao beans from the pods so that she can sell the final product.  Her efforts result in a good financial income.  Normally her products are sold at the local collection centers for a reasonable price.  Her work routine is from Monday to Saturday, beginning at 6am and lasting until 6pm.  Nery\u2019s wish for the near future is to have her own source of water in order to differentiate herself from the competition and create a new source of income.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  Nery plans to complete her payments faithfully.  She predicts that she will have much success with her Communal Bank since the members get along with one another.  The loan she is requesting will be used to buy supplies and compost in order to provide adequate maintenance for her cacao crops.  This will improve the quality and quantity of her production.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":596135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase compost & supplies for her cacao crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-09T08:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nery ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3006.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269312}],"funded_date":"2010-09-13T12:17:57Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":233262,"name":"Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Isabel es soltera, tiene 51 a\u00f1os y 4 hijos de los cuales solo una vive con ella y estudia en el colegio, Isabel vende agregados en un local alquilado, vende productos como arena, ladrillos, productos que trae del r\u00edo con un carro alquilado, sus ventas son al por mayor y menos cuenta con un carro peque\u00f1o para el reparto.

She has been doing this for the past 5 years and the toughest part in the competition. That is why she provides excellent service and little by little has gained customers.

M. is a married woman who has two children aged 15 and 17.  She owns a beauty salon where she offers haircuts, hair straightenings, manicures and pedicures.  She also sells beauty products, especially facial cleansers.\r\n\r\nSalis started out in her business 12 years ago.  Over the years she has learned how to make significant changes in the image and beauty of her customers.  She started out when she was still studying for a degree in social and economic sciences at university but she gave this up and studied hairdressing for two years.  She did a good job of learning the techniques of the trade and was really enthusiastic about setting up her own business.  She bought her first basic tools and, with a lot of perseverance, she managed to expand her range of offerings.  She studied cosmetology, and facial and body aesthetics, and put into practice everything that she learned. \r\n\r\nThis is Salis' 11th loan.  She will use her Kiva loan to adapt her premises and expand her space so that she can adapt the small space from which she sells iced treats and turn it into an ice-cream parlor.  Her dream is to own an aesthetics and beauty clinic, and to advise her customers, offering them products that they really need, to highlight their personal and professional image."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":732695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

the district and community named Yauli. Yauli has a warm climate. The most popular occupation is commerce because there is an abundance of potatoes, onions, wheat, and livestock, including cows, goats, and sheep, although in smaller numbers. The community also produces milk and cheese, and its beautiful sights attract tourists. Along the streets of Yauli you can see the Chopccas, the native people of the region who dress in colorful garments. In Yauli there is place near the train station where the members of Finca Peru sell their delicious potato and cheese dishes to the passengers.<p>\r\n\r\nPaulina C. is married and has two children, 23 and 30 years old, who are both married. Paulina started selling lollipops, earning nine soles for every box she sold. She heard about Finca Peru in the train station, and she decided to take part in their meetings. Her loans have allowed her to rent a store downtown in Yauli and purchase pots and pans, dishes, and clothing to stock the store. Paulina told us that business is going very well. With Finca Peru she learned to overcome problems in managing a store and thanks to the training given to members, she considers Finca Peru as a parent giving her a loan to start a new business. She learned how to save money and to set up a working capital fund. Paulina's dream is to have a larger store and to purchase more merchandise to better serve her clients.\r\n<p>\r\nMarceL. T. is married and has 4 children. She sells meats. MarceL. has a daughter who is mentally disabled and wanders the streets. This worries MarceL. very much but her friends at Finca Peru remind her that with the help of God she will get better. With her loans MarceL. rented a store in downtown Yauli and purchased more merchandise. She sells ice cream, soft drinks, and beer. Her dream is to purchase a house in downtown Yauli. It is very expensive but she is saving to make her dream a reality.\r\n<p>\r\nDoris B. is married and has 2 children, 2 and 4 years old. She tells us that her husband has abandoned her and during that period she suffered a great deal. She is the only one supporting her daughters. She has a convenience store where she previously sold only groceries, but little by little she was able to improve the selection. Now she sells meats, vegetables, fruits, clothing etc. In Yuali there are many weddings and baptisms and she wants to purchase merchandise for these special occasions. She has learned to appreciate herself as a woman and never allow herself to be mistreated. She is grateful to Finca Peru because she learned how to save money, to be strong, and have strong values. Doris\u2019 dream is to proviD. her daughters with an education, until they grow up to be professionals.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was established in 1923 by the Catholic Mission to spread education and religious doctrine. The school has a total number of 570 pupils and a staff of thirteen teachers. The school produces good results at the National Primary School Exams (NPSE). They also organize sports and thanks giving every academic year for the pupils.\r\n\r\nSome of the major challenges facing this school are the late receipt of school fee subsidies from the government, the belated arrival of the teaching materials and the inadequate seating accommodations for the pupils.\r\n\r\nTeachers and other professional workers come to SMT to seek loans for different reasons. Since salaries are usually very small, they are prompted to engage in businesses to supplement their meager salaries. Some cannot run a business for themselves directly; rather, they will invest whatever little they have into their wives\u2019 businesses. Others seek a loan in order to pursue further studies or to pay school fees for their children. There will also be some who will want a loan to buy pieces of furniture like chairs or a bed, and some will want to either start building a house or continue with a house building project they have already begun. It is for some of these reasons that teachers at St. Raphael have come to SMT to seek a loan. \r\n\r\nSylvanus A. K. (left) is the head of this group. He has been in the teaching profession for thirty years. He was born in Waterloo, twenty miles (32 km) from Freetown. He is fifty years old and married to a businesswoman. They have seven children between the ages of seven and twenty-one. With this loan, Mr. K. will buy house-building materials such as doors and windows. He has already started building the house and only the doors and windows are lacking for the completion of the house. This loan will certainly enable Mr. K. to achieve his dream of completing his house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":292925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To supplement their salaries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Waterloo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T22:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sylvanus A.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mabinty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alphenus A.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He now does maintenance and upkeep for seven commercial buildings and apartments, spending two hours a day at each location.  \r\n\r\nAt some locations, Oscar has the opportunity to increase his profits by offering car-washing as a service. He is requesting a loan from ACCION USA to purchase the equipment he needs to get started. He needs a water tank, a pump and hose, some bulk cleaning supplies, as well as a used van to transport the material.\r\n\r\nOscar is enthusiastic and optimistic about the expansion of his cleaning business.

There's always a way to get out from under it. In 1999, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines with hope to access capital for her business. During her previous loans, she carefully invested in resale of fruits and dressed chicken. The business went good and brings her enough income for her family.\r\n\r\nNow on her 10th loan, she proposes a loan as addtional capital for her business fruit stand and resale of dressed chicken. She is optimistic that she can bring her family out of poverty as she feels slowly the progress of her

This family lives in a small house, which is their own.\r\n\r\nFor 24 years he has been cultivating peas, corn, potatoes (Peruvian tuber), and different colors of gladiola flowers.  He inherited the land from his parents.  His wife and children help him cultivate the land.  What he likes best about his work is harvesting the potatoes and flowers, which sell rapidly in the wholesale market in the city.  This activity allows him to live comfortably and to provide an adequate education for his children.  With the earnings he also is able to get animals like livestock, horses, and donkeys.  These make his farming work easier.\r\n\r\nHis desires to progress have made him think of buying more land and planting in greater quantity in the future.  Most of all, he will do this with peas because he invests a small amount and gets good earnings in less time.\r\n\r\nThis is his ninth loan with MFP, and he knows that he will be punctual and responsible as always.  He will use the money from the loan to buy bags of pea seeds, organic fertilizer, and chemical fertilizer to take care of his land.

Coming from an area where cattle-raising is popular, Numonjon has been selling cattle since 2001. He buys them in his village from the farmers who raise them and then sells them at the markets. As his business capital is limited, Numonjon buys just a few and then after he sells those, he returns to buy more. \r\n\r\nToday he would like to expand his business by increasing his capital so that he can maximize his profits. For this reason, Numonjon is requesting a loan of $3000 to purchase young cattle. This will be his second loan with IMON International, and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The group is comprised of 12 very active and dynamic members.  Elsa Miriam is a member who demonstrates this.  She works selling \u201cchoripanes\u201d (barbecued sausage stuffed in bread) and sandwiches in the old station in the city of El Alto.  \r\n\r\nShe is married and has two children.  Her husband is a bricklayer, and he helps her with some of the household expenses.  Because this is not enough, she needs to work for her children\u2019s food and education.  Her children are school-age.  That is how they got the name of the group.  The family makes any small business big.  Elsa Miriam\u2019s greatest hope is that her children become professionals and to see them develop enough so that they have a better future.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the members sell wholesale CDs, beer, clothes, and plastics.  Some provide plumbing and transportation services.  There is plenty of competition in the market, but they get ahead by quickly changing and stocking their merchandise.  That way they get the necessary income to support their families.\r\n\r\nThe current loan will be used as operating capital to get merchandise, supplies, and materials to increase their sales and improve their families\u2019 quality of life.  The group is currently in their fourth cycle.  They always demonstrate competence, responsibility, and commitment to their group.  Many of the small business have grown.  For example, Elsa Miriam now has her cart for selling choripanes.  She can give her customers better service.  Now she wants to start selling another type of food.  That is the reason she needs the loan. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva
