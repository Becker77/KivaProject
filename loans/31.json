It was founded in 2003, inspired by the solidarity and affinity that exists between the women.  After the group had existed for seven years and the women had gained experience in group organization, they approached the micro-finance institution, CAURIE-MF, to make use of their financial services.   Thus, on April 29, 2010, they became a Banc Villageois with the same name as their group and the village. They received their first loan on May 17, 2010 when they were inaugurated.\r\n\r\nThree quarters of the members are married and have at least two children; the average age of the women is 40. \r\n\r\nThe President of the Banc Villageois, Madame Awa N., is 47 and has four children. She farms livestock and plans to use her loan to buy four goats, which she will raise for at least four months before selling them in the large weekly market in her village.  She has been doing this for three years. In order to reduce feeding costs, she collects hay at the end of the rainy season and dries it so that it keeps better. Her goal is to help improve her family's standard of living by contributing to the cost of food, health care and clothing for her children. Her earnings also allow her to satisfy her own personal needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a single mom, and has a 14-year-old son.  She lives with her father in Viloma, a canton of the Sipe Sipe municipality, province of Quillacolla, 20 km. from Cochabamba.\r\n\r\nFor the past fifteen years, she has worked in dairy, since her mother died.  She also sees to her father\u2019s well-being, as he is elderly and can no longer work.  That\u2019s why she takes care of him, for she is the youngest sibling, and the only woman in the family.  Maria is a hard-working woman who gets up very early to milk the cows and deliver milk to the station in the area.  She also farms, growing onions and carrots in certain seasons.\r\n\r\nShe is devoted to her work but does not neglect her son\u2019s upbringing, and consistently supports him in his schooling.  Her dream is for her son to enroll in the university to complete his studies.  She wants him to study medicine and thus be able to help the people in the community where they live.  It is an isolated area whose inhabitants struggle to make a living.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to purchase cattle and thus increase milk production and deliver more to the station.  This will enable her to increase her earnings and provide a better future for her son and make her father more comfortable in his old age.  He always worked for her brothers and for her, and that is why she strives to be better each day.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":607128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Compra de una cabeza de ganado lechero","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-09-26T01:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188657927},{"amount":301.34,"local_amount":301.34,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":301.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201262148},{"amount":298.66,"local_amount":298.66,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":298.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216479303},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-29T07:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232770071}],"funded_date":"2010-09-26T12:53:21Z","paid_date":"2011-10-29T07:46:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Jane Wilkie","image":null}},{"id":238509,"name":"Harrison","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Harrison is married and has two children whom he supports.

She runs a small store selling candies and sweets. The store is located on the first floor of a big apartment building which provides easy access for her clientele. She has been in this business for 6 years. \r\n\r\nRuzijon is very cheery and optimistic. Her store faces high competition as there are many supermarkets in the neighborhood. However, her customer-friendly service and the individual attention she can give help her keep loyal customers. Her responsibility and perseverance have helped Ruzijon repay all loans she has received from IMON International successfully. \r\n\r\nRuzijon is requesting a loan of $1500 US for a couple of purposes. She is going to do some remodeling work inside her vending facility and she\u2019d like to increase the assortment of products she has available. This loan will help Ruzijon expand her business, having a positive impact on her trade profitability, and helping to further improve the economic and social situation of her family.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Collision and Auto Repair\", as a family affair. The staff is comprised of Israel, his father and his brother. With a true entrepreneurial spirit, he states that the reason for starting his business was, simply, that \u201cnobody was hiring.\u201d With combined 40 years of experience, Israel and his family were able to take the grim reality of the economic downturn and turn it into a business opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe road to a successful business, Israel says, hasn\u2019t been an easy one. When he opened his business, which offers a wide range of automobile services from mechanical repairs to body work, it was located in a small shop in a residential neighborhood that wasn\u2019t a prime location for a body shop. The most successful business choice C. Auto Repair has made since it opened was moving from its original shop in Rueda, Texas, to a larger shop in Dallas. Of this choice, Israel says, \u201cWe took a leap of faith and moved to Dallas, and we just started growing based on referrals alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile he is happy about the business\u2019 success in its new location, Israel is constantly driving to grow and expand the services he offers. \u201cIn the future, I would really like to offer full-service everything \u2013 state inspections and alignments in a year or two, and, eventually, one or two other locations,\u201d he says. Getting to this future goal involves tireless work from Israel and his family \u2013 the shop is open for business 7 days a week, and Israel is typically there from open to close.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, C. Auto Repair was able to attain the operating capital needed to begin working in its new location. A large portion of the loan was used to install the plumbing systems necessary to get certified by the state. The remainder allowed Israel to buy an inspection machine, which will be used to further him toward his goal of turning C. Auto into a full-service shop.\r\n\r\nIsrael\u2019s business ethic is rooted in a dedication to good customer service. The advice that he gives to aspiring business owners is that \u201cthe biggest thing is return customers; always take care of your customers, and in return they will take care of you.\u201d This loan has allowed Israel to continue doing work he loves, expand his family business and continue to reliably serve the automobile needs of his Dallas community.

raised four children.  In search of an income source for his family, he started his own business of selling products and goods of daily demand in 2009.  Chiybyl's store is famous for the good quality of products.  He sells products at low prices, which is important to people with small incomes.

Her husband got a disease and died in 1998, making her life even more difficult.  Her four children and she put all of their efforts to earn money for the living.  At the beginning she applied for a 200 USD loan to raise pigs.  After substracting all the costs, her first pigs bring her 100 USD profit.  She continues to apply for loans to expand her business.  When all of her children have grown up, she applies for the highest loan to open a new store which provides building materials like gravel, sand, etc.  Her total income from both the pigs and the store in Trung Gia commune, Soc Son district is around 370 \u2013 430 USD.  Her two oldest children just get married, so the family expenses increase.  She would like to apply for a 1200 USD loan to expand her business model to increase her income.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb G\u00e1i, 52 tu\u1ed5i, \u0111\u00e3 tham gia Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c 11 n\u0103m.

He went to school through third grade.  He is married and the father of five children, ages two to nine years old.  Only the eldest goes to school.  In pursuit of work, Arlindo left his family in Gaza and moved to Namaacha, a village on the border with Swaziland.  <P>\r\n\r\nArlindo had to interrupt his studies after finishing third grade because of the meager financial situation of his parents, who were poor country folk.  As such, he had to start working as a cook in people\u2019s houses.  Years later he was contracted by some customs employees who worked at the border in Namaacha, where he moved to take the job.  He received 1,850 meticais (MTn) per month while working as a cook.  Years later his employers were transferred, and he found employment at a five-star hotel in the village (Hotel Libombos), where he has worked until now.  He works 7am to 3pm on the morning shift and 3pm to 10pm on the afternoon shift, earning a monthly salary of 1,800MTn.  But because this salary was not enough to cover all his necessities, he decided to open his own business.  He acquired a stall at the central market in the village, where he sells clothes he purchases in Swaziland.  His best-selling items are nightgowns, shorts, and shirts, which he buys for 55MTn, 120MTn, and 220MTn and sells for 180MTn, 250MTn, and 450MTn respectively.  He makes a monthly profit of 4,000MTn.  He is able to save 1,500MTn, sends 3,500MTn to his family, and spends 800MTn. In addition to supporting his family, he takes care of three nephews, who live with his wife in Gaza because they lost their father.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Arlindo\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku [Kiva\u2019s Field Partner] and his first with Kiva.  He used his first loan of 9,200MTn to buy merchandise and requests this second loan of 15,000MTn for the same end.  He is confident that he will repay before the due date and will ask for another loan to complete his work in Gaza.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

He lives with his brother and shares activities with him. Together they looked for opportunities outside of their birthplace. As of this date, they have obtained their own home, which took quite a bit of effort. Since Angel has finished his secondary studies, he has been interested in having his own business. Economic conditions had not allowed him to begin this business. To achieve his goals, he had to work at different sales jobs in the crowded markets of the city. After several years he obtained the capital that he needed and with his brother they purchased a booth where they sell clothes in the most popular market in the city. The large crowds in this market help their business. Never the less, the customers are very particular. The brothers have to provide a variety of clothing They also must provide the latest styles for men and women. It is in this manner that they work from eight in the morning until eleven at night.

Jessie is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to repair an existing vehicle for better service. This will be his first loan from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

From her childhood she has farmed, as it was her main source of income. The products that she cultivates the most are potatoes and corn. After about 6 months there is a harvest, for which she requires the help of labourers to facilitate the extraction of these products. She is very happy doing this work because she considers herself to be a capable and independent person. She wants to expand her land in order to cultivate more crops and increase production. This is her first loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she has financial support. She is grateful to be part of her community bank because all of her peers are responsible and supportive. She thanks those who will lend money toward this loan. It will be very useful in the progress of her activities.

She is 19 years old and married. To make a living, Cherrie Mae owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop.

Cherrie Mae is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like biscuits and instant noodles. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Cherrie Mae from HSPFI.

Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She also supplies fresh fruit to hotels for additional income. She is married and has three children, ages 18, 16, 10 years old. All attend school; the elder two in high schools and the last in primary school. She lives in Malindi town of the Coastal Province, Kenya. \r\n\r\nJosephine joined Milango in April, 2011, after an invitation from a friend. Her major challenge comes from her supply business where payments are made on a monthly basis. A loan of 60,000 Kenyan shillings will help Josephine restock her business with retail stock like soap, sugar, flour, oil, etc. Josephine intends to faithfully repay her upcoming loan, so she can obtain higher credit and establish a salon and a boutique. This loan will also help her obtain additional income to carry out farming on the piece of land she bought using her first loan. She hopes Milango partners, especially KIVA, will support her with credit for her upcoming businesses.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":891336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She feels very good being a part of her community bank because it allows her to have savings.  The money she is now asking for is to buy utensils for her restaurant.  She will also buy new tablecloths and ingredients (rice and condiments) in large quantities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":384650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy utensils and ingredients for her food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-07T17:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brigida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:30:45Z","rounded_local_amount":205.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081310},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":205.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997465},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":205.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842810},{"amount":280,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-16T10:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":823.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734387},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":205.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717243},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":205.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751020},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":205.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933658}],"funded_date":"2009-09-07T22:27:20Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":139403,"name":"Hard Working Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These are members of the Hard Working group.

She says selling these products is very lucrative and she has been in business for twenty years now. With her rich experience in selling, she is very popular in the areas where she trades her goods. She takes delivery of stock from the farming communities and this prevents her from using intermediaries who sell to her at higher prices.

They consistently put forth huge efforts in order to lead a decent life.  Some of them are the only providers for their families.  Kumushay A. is the leader of the group.  She is a mother of three children: two sons and one daughter.  All of the children attend universities, and the huge burden for paying their education contracts lies on the shoulders of Kumushay and her husband.  In order to provide the children with education, Kumushay took out a loan in the sum of five thousand som ($100) in 2001 and started selling various goods (seeds, chewing gum, candy, etc.) at a store that she opened together with her husband near their home.  She was fortunate to have the store near a school.  The sales were very good, and soon Kumushay and her husband were able to increase the goods turnover to twenty thousand som ($450).  Their current net monthly profit from the sales is from five to six thousand som.  Her husband and daughter primarily work at the store now.  Kumushay found a salesperson job at a pharmacy opposite a hospital and receives a salary in the sum of four thousand som ($90).  She needed means to increase goods turnover and merchandise variety at their store.  This is why she requested this loan.\r\n\r\nHer group partners are:\r\n\r\nElmira B. is forty-five years old.

His wife is a homemaker, and this is why he is mainly responsible for supporting the family.  Rahatbek is involved in agriculture.  He buys livestock, fattens it and resells it.

By the grace of God, Roselyn has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send all of her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Roselyn as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nRoselyn operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them piecemeal with a little profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing and other such products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy greater quantity and more variety of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nRoselyn dreams of being able to give all her children a good, high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":617965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more products to expand her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T09:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roselyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":933.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":130,"local_amount":5599.98,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5645.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380506},{"amount":195,"local_amount":8400.02,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":8468.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816840}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T14:16:50Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":242642,"name":"Jessica Tatiana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudadela Cevallos de la ciudad de Portoviejo se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas el Banco Comunal Damas De \u00c9xito, esta es una zona urbano marginal muy poblada en esta ciudad.\n\nAqu\u00ed encontramos a la se\u00f1ora Jessica, ella tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y tiene una hija de 5 a\u00f1os de edad la cual est\u00e1 en el primer a\u00f1o de educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica, su marido realiza transporte escolar en su carro.\n\nSe dedica al comercio, arrienda un local en el centro de la ciudad de Portoviejo donde vende zapatos de ni\u00f1as, nos cuenta que ya son tres a\u00f1os que lleva en este negocio y que gracias  a Dios le ha ido bien, trabaja todos los d\u00edas desde las 8am hasta las 18h00, cuenta con la ayuda de una ayudante a la cual ella le paga un sueldo.

They are all involved in clothing retail and support each other in repaying the loan.\r\n\r\nGulnarkan K., 50, is a leader of this group. She\u2019s a resident of one of the five largest towns in the Jalalabad province. She lives with her husband, who is a private entrepreneur as a city cab driver, and with a 16-year-old daughter, who goes to high school. \r\n\r\nGulnarkan has always been characterized by her friends and relatives as a person with a fighting spirit and a big desire to move forward. She says these precise features helped her to start up a women\u2019s apparel retail business. Being a business-lady, she truly realizes the importance of the environment in business. She always hopes to have political and economic stability in Kyrgyzstan. This knowledge is due to her original profession in economics. Many years ago she used to work as an economist in a plant, but soon it stopped functioning and forced her to go into the business sphere. \r\n\r\nSix years ago, Gulnarakan spent 300,000 soms form the family budget to build a shop. She attaches high importance to how the shop looks and has decorated it carefully. Now she gains the fruits of her labor by 15,000 soms of monthly income. \r\n\r\nGulnarkan applied for this loan with the belief that it\u2019ll help her to increase her stock. The generated revenue will be spent on construction of a house. \r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From? <\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple \"P\" bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

A., age 27, is a young kerosene merchant in the village of Aklakou, where he lives with his family of five people. The place where he sells kerosene for lamps is out in the open, under the hot sun. He is often obliged to buy on credit and repay after he sells the kerosene. That system does not permit him to make enough profit to support his family and improve his business premises. The need to build a shed to sell out of and to pay upfront for the kerosene leads him to ask for a loan of US$ 1200. Finding financing for these improvements in his business will allow him to flourish and to better provide for his family. <P> <B>Translated from the French by Teresa Kramer, KIVA volunteer <P><\/B>Age de 27 ans, M.

He is 42 years old, is married and has 4 children.  Olimjon has a high school education and works at a construction site.  He does not earn very much at his job and supplements his income by raising livestock.  Olimjon has a small barn with several small calves.  He purchases them, grows them, fattens them and then sells them.  He has very little working capital and he needs additional funds. <p>\r\n\r\nOlimjon thought about it for a long time, decided that he could get a loan and turned to us.  With the loan he will be able to purchase 2-3 calves, fatten them for around 3 months and resell them for a profit.  By that time demand for animals will increase and prices will go up.  Purchasing calves now, will allow Olimjon to raise the animals without additional costs, because it is now spring and there are no problems with getting grass for feed.  This will allow Olimjon to maximize his profits and to improve his family\u2019s financial situation.  He has 4 children and would like to give them the opportunity to study and to get an education.  He will pay back the loan over 15 months.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0410\u0447\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432

Anne recently joined the K-MET network to become a volunteer Community Health Worker in her neighborhood. This makes her eligible for a K-MET loan.<P>\r\n\r\nAnne has a small business selling net curtains and sheets in the Kibuye Market on Sunday, the main market day, and door-to-door on other days. She started this business in 1990. It was in that year that Anne decided that her former business of selling vegetables was not earning enough profit, so she switched to selling curtains. P>\r\n\r\nOne of the challenges of the business is that sometimes Anne will deliver an item without having received payment \u2013 this prevents her from buying more stock until she can get the payment from the customer. Anne is applying for a loan of approximately 275 USD from K-MET in order to increase her stock of curtains and sheets.

Nasibakhon is 39 years old and comes from a large and humble family. She is married and the loving mother of three children. Her father's hard and demanding character showed her, from the time she was a little girl, the significant value of work, and therefore she has been successful in various activities throughout her life. \r\n\r\nNow she dedicates herself to raising and selling cows and sheep. With the income she generates, she provides a better quality of life for her children, who are her greatest joy and have become her best friends. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan of $1000 USD for 9 months to buy more young cattle to sell when they are fully grown. With this investment, Mrs. Nasibakhon will be able to substantially increase her earnings and improve her quality of life. Let\u2019s support this dedicated mother's proposal.\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At 37 years old, she lives in a house with her family and\r\nwhat she most wants is to have a better future. When she left her hometown, she decided that she would do all she could to improve her life, and today she buys hardware supplies at low prices in Oruro and sells them in hardware stores in the city of Puno at a very good price, which drives up demand. Isabel enjoys distributing construction materials, since it gives her the freedom to travel around the city freely. She has been doing this for 4 years, and the most difficult part is transporting her goods long distances since it is so tiring. In the future, she hopes to have her own store where she herself can sell the merchandise that she purchases. This is the second loan she has solicited from MFO, and she is very happy to have received the first one. She looks forward to making her payments on time, and in her community bank she is loved and respected. With the 1700 Sols she plans to increase her investment capital in order to buy more materials.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cyrus Maher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":314784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-08T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":213},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":213},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":213},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":213},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":213},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":213},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":213},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":209}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.04},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.04},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.04},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.04},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.04},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.04},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.04},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.04,"local_amount":213,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":216.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596198},{"amount":72.04,"local_amount":213,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":216.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990476},{"amount":72.04,"local_amount":213,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":216.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211587},{"amount":72.04,"local_amount":213,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":216.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641109},{"amount":72.04,"local_amount":213,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":216.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080549},{"amount":72.04,"local_amount":213,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":216.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996673},{"amount":72.04,"local_amount":213,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":216.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842157},{"amount":70.72,"local_amount":209,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":212.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733831}],"funded_date":"2009-05-11T00:23:31Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:20:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cyrus Maher","image":null}},{"id":110692,"name":"Lani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lani E. is 42 years old and married to Antonio, a civil engineer.

In the attempt to grow the volume of her business she approached Hluvuku and solicited a loan in the amount of 10,000MT.\r\n\r\nHer best product is bread which she acquires in neighboring Swaziland.  Besides her children Alice is not responsible for anyone.  She is able to save a little each month.  She says that she will be able to pay off this loan without difficulties, and she will request other loans to grow her business as well as realize her other future plans.<br \/><p><strong>Translated

He lives with his 25 year old son, and is his mother's carer. For 4 years he has worked selling guinea pigs in the main markets in his neighbourhood. He makes his sales every weekend and on the other days, with the help of his mother, he cares for and feeds his guinea pigs in the farm he has built in his house. Owing to the good care that he offers his animals, he has had good sales, because his guinea pigs are of a good size and weight. In the near future, Rufino wants to expand his farm and improve the breed of his animals so he can move forward with his sales. This is the third time he has had a loan with MFP. His commitment during these 2 years of work in his communal bank is recognised by the other members and his desire is to continue to contribute the best for the wellbeing of his group. The money that he is seeking will be destined for the purchase of a large quantity of guinea pigs to increase his sales. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":344385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of guinea pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-29T00:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rufino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":380.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211957},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":380.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641485},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":380.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080924},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:03:19Z","rounded_local_amount":380.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997066},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:33Z","rounded_local_amount":380.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842407},{"amount":375,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-19T10:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1141.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733975}],"funded_date":"2009-06-30T18:39:12Z","paid_date":"2010-01-19T10:53:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":122980,"name":"Deep","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Deep is married with a family consisting of eight members, their ages varying from 20 to 4 years old.

He deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him.         \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

C. is 31 years old, and comes from the central part of the City of Masaya.  This area specializes in the production of handicrafts, such as leather work, pottery, plastic, and others.  Francisco is the head of a young family which includes his daughter of 6 years, to whom he dedicates his life and work, and his wife, who has supported him in all of his projects and dreams.  He owns a handicraft workshop, where he works making footwear, such as slippers and shoes for schoolchildren.  He learned the trade because he worked as an employee in a workshop in the occupation that they call \"alistadores\" (this term refers to those who make the sole of the shoe, and later give it to those who finish it.)  His aunt distributes shoes in different areas of the country; this motivated him to have his own workshop, since she offered to sell the shoes that he would produce.  Francisco has passed through some difficult situations, as when he suffered appendicitis, and was just recovering when his mother died.  This loss was very hard for his family, but most of all for him.  In spite of this, with the help of his wife and the encouragement and love of his daughter, he decided to exert himself much more and, with the loans that he secured, establish a mini grocery store.  The current loan will be invested in the growth of the mini grocery and in raw materials for his workshop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

organization located in Manistutu village near the town of Melaya in northwest Bali. Manis Kasih was originally formed out of the initiative of mothers who, at the time, found it very difficult to obtain loans to develop their businesses. Local banks had numerous requirements that were quite burdensome to the women and thus made it difficult to secure loans. This group was formed to make loans more accessible to the women in the region and, with its continued growth, became a legal entity in Bali in 2007.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Manis Kasih Women\u2019s Cooperative has 126 members, all of whom are mothers of children of various ages. The group is located in a rural region of Bali, thus the majority of the women utilizing these loans work in agriculture as farmers, breeders or traders. Other women own small shops that sell daily goods such as rice, soap, etc. In this group there are also a few tailors and chocolate traders who will receive loans.\r\n \r\nTo meet the needs of its members and allow them to expand their businesses, Manis Kasih Women\u2019s Cooperative is working with Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) and Kiva to receive a loan fund that will be managed by the group leadership in accordance with the rules the members have established.\r\n\r\nThe leadership team pictured here will receive this loan and will distribute it to a group of approximately forty women who are all members of Manis Kasih. The loan money will allow the women to expand their respective businesses by buying new livestock, food or supplies for their animals, or by buying items to sell in their stores.\r\n\r\nThis subset of the Manis Kasih is headed by Ni Putu B. and they have requested a loan in the amount of 25,000,000 IDR. Ni Putu B. is a chocolate merchant. As the wife of a farmer, she chooses to not stay at home quietly, simply relying on her husband\u2019s income. Instead, she searches for additional family income by riding on her motorcycle around the village each day to buy local crops such as coconuts, bananas and chocolate that she can sell in markets in neighboring regions. With her profits from this venture she supplements her husband\u2019s income primarily to pay the school fees of her two young children.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Note to Kiva Lenders: <\/b> \r\nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\r\n\r\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\r\n \r\nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking\" TARGET=\"_new\">here<\/a>.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":490022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more local crops such as coconuts, bananas and chocolate","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-02-17T17:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Kadek ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Kadek ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":25000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2675,"local_amount":25000000,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":25011250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195878554}],"funded_date":"2010-02-18T10:24:02Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":181062,"name":"Phanice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phanice A. is a 43-year-old single mother of three (3) children and a businesswoman in Nambale.

She offers her products in a busy plaza in the city of Chep\u00e9n to passersby who come through the area.  Karina sells her products every day early in the morning and also in the afternoon.  This business is an important source of income to her family, so she tries to maintain it with great effort.\r\n<p>\r\nHer vending post receives many customers, which is why she wants to expand her business by purchasing more products so that she can offer more variety.  For this reason, she is requesting her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 400 PEN.  She wants to buy sausages, butter, and other products that are served for breakfast and snacks (most people take a light meal between lunch and dinner, usually eaten between 5-7pm).  \r\n<p>\r\nKarina is an enterprising woman who always looks after the welfare of her family.  Her greatest wish is to see her children become professionals and develop into good people.  She is well-liked and respected by her neighbors and acquaintances, who consider her to be a trustworthy and responsible woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":525007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase butter, sausages, and other products to sell in addition to bread","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chep\u00e9n, La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-04-19T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina Margot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":31.91},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":32.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":32.49},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":32.73},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":32.9},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":33.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33.71},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":33.96},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":34.18},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":34.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.97},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.09},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.18},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.28},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.64},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.74},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.81},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.93},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":48.52,"local_amount":129.38,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":138.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662425},{"amount":62.72,"local_amount":167.25,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":179.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695137},{"amount":38.76,"local_amount":103.37,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":110.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878181}],"funded_date":"2010-04-19T00:32:51Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":197585,"name":"Magaly Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 pertenece a la parroquia Picoaza en la capital manabita, es un sitio muy comercial donde sus habitantes viven en comercio informal, es aqu\u00ed donde cada a\u00f1o realizan la feria del juguete y adem\u00e1s de tener los precios mas bajos en todas sus mercader\u00eda, aqu\u00ed en este sitio hay cantidad de negocios, como la venta de ropa, accesorios para el hogar, accesorios para los celulares y mas productos desde ah\u00ed llevan a vender a otras partes de la provincia.\n\nAl visitar este banco comunal pudimos conocer de una de las comerciantes de la parroquia, la se\u00f1ora Magaly, esta casada a sus 39 a\u00f1os tiene dos hijos y se dedica al comercio de compra y venta de hamacas (camas colgantes), en estas hamacas se utiliza el material de hilo tra\u00eddas directamente de una parte de la sierra en la provincia de Imbabura extramente en Otavalo hasta ese lugar se traslada la socia a comprar a los mayoristas, pero en los \u00faltimos tiempos ya son los distribuidores que le visitan a su domicilio para entregarle los pedidos que realiza por mes.\n\nDe las ventas esta encargado el esposo es quien entrega los pedidos, ellos entregan a comerciantes que recorren el pa\u00eds, los precios de las hamacas est\u00e1n estimados entre 13, 8  y 4 d\u00f3lares al por mayor, dependiendo como este la demanda hacen los pedios pero es cada 15 d\u00edas lo mas habitual, ya son cliente fijos que van directamente a la casa a comprar, con el nuevo cr\u00e9dito que va a recibir la se\u00f1ora Magaly invertir\u00e1 en unas 300 hamacas que tiene por entregar durante el mes.

She started her business from a small number of shoes she offered for sale and has slowly expanded her inventory. Now she has a market stall from which she runs her business.

Su esposa se dedica a la venta de medicina de botiqu\u00edn (que no necesita receta m\u00e9dica) de comunidad en comunidad.\n\nDurante la epoca seca (aproximadamente 9 meses del a\u00f1o), Catalino depende de su empleo como jornalero en una finca ganadera. En dicho empleo gana entre $6 a $8 d\u00f3lares diarios. Durante la epoca de cultivo, Catalino cultiva un maximo de 7,000 metros cuadrados. \u00c9l cosecha lo suficiente para la alimentaci\u00f3n de su familia, y deja una porci\u00f3n para la venta. De las ganancias de la venta, Catalino compra todos los insumos necesarios para su cultivo.

Hace dos a\u00f1os Catalino y su esposa construyeron su casa de adobe (tierra o barro crudo).

De igual modo el inmueble subir\u00e1 en valor con acceso a dicho servicio.\n\nEn un futuro Catalino quiere comprar un refrigerador, y una cocina o una plancha pupusera (para hacer pupusas, platillo t\u00edpico de El Salvador). Por la ubicaci\u00f3n estrat\u00e9gica de su vivienda, Catalino desea tener una peque\u00f1a tienda y venta de pupusas.

Catalino works as a laborer during the dry season (November to June) and as a farmer during the rest of the year (which is during the rainy season).  His wife sells over-the-counter medicines in their community.\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the dry season (which lasts approximately nine months), Catalino depends on his job as a ranch hand.  In this job, he earns between $6 to $8 per day.  During the farming season, he cultivates 7000 square meters of land.  He grows enough to feed his family and has a portion left over to sell.  The profit from what he sells is used to buy all the supplies he needs for farming.  Last year, Catalino received a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for growing corn.  He completed his payments responsibly.\r\n<p>\r\nHe is now requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo in order to install electricity in his house.  In addition, he will build a fence along the perimeter of his farmland.  Two years ago, Catalino and his wife built a house out of adobe (earth or crude clay).  With the help of this loan, Catalino will be able to have electricity in his house for the first time in his life.  As a result, he will be able to have appliances for preparing and preserving food.  In addition, his home will have greater security because he will have lighting at night. Since his property will have access to this service, it will increase in value.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Catalino wants to buy a refrigerator, a stove, and a griddle for making \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pupusa\" target=\"_blank\" >pupusas<\/a>\u201d (a traditional dish in El Salvador).  Since his home is in a strategic location, Catalino wants to open a small store and start selling \u201cpupusas\u201d so that his wife will not have to travel far in order to work.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Osana  has 3 years of experience in this business.  Osana  needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 280 tala or US $117 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Osana  joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Osana 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Osana  T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She lives in her own house alongside her husband, Homero, 47, and their three dear children to whom they wish to provide a better quality of life. Julia's daily activity is selling meat. She has a stall in the No 2 market (an important market in the city of Pucallpa), which is very busy, since she always sells meat of very good quality. She is a very happy seller and receives her customers with a smile on her lips. What she likes most about her work is to converse with her neighboring sellers.  She has been doing this work for 13 years and considers having to stay at her stall all day without being able to leave the most difficult part.

The communal bank meets once a month in the town of Kiteni.  This is where we met a member, Ruth Mery.\r\n\r\nRuth Mery tell us, \u201cI was born in the city of Kiteni.  I am 23 years old.  I do not yet have children, but I will soon be a mother.  I live in the city where I was born and where my primary business activity is selling food.\u201d  Ruth Mery has a small restaurant where she sells breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  At the moment the business is incapacitated because they are refurbishing the place.\r\n\r\nShe has been in the business for one year, and it is going very well for her thanks to the effort she puts into her work.  At this time Ruth Mery is working in a laundry washing clothes from seven in the morning until midday on Mondays through Fridays.\r\n\r\nHer father invited her to participate in the communal bank.  Her first loan was for 800 soles, and she used it to buy supplies.  This time she needs the loan to equip her restaurant, and she wants to buy chairs, tables, and utensils.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":821064,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2425,"youtubeId":"MmMSDdzufiI","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur  Ruth Mery from  Peru","thumbnailImageId":821064},"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to equip her restaurant and buy chairs, tables, and utensils.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Echarate - La Convencion - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2011-07-23T16:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3125,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Ruth Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antoquia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicente","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Jhonn","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia Honorata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neftali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1284.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1334.97},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1387.89},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1442.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1500.2},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1549.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":472.07},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.8},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":510.26},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":530.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":551.54},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":569.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":472.07,"local_amount":1284.04,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226988985},{"amount":490.8,"local_amount":1334.97,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1341.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232747689},{"amount":510.26,"local_amount":1387.89,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238551764},{"amount":530.5,"local_amount":1442.96,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1450.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244510586},{"amount":1121.37,"local_amount":3050.14,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:25:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3065.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250718161}],"funded_date":"2011-08-14T12:23:50Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:25:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":324632,"name":"Cyprien","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cyprien has been a Rwandan rice farmer for the past two years and was trained by his COOP (cooperative).\r\n\r\nHe will use his Kiva loan to cover labor costs during rice production: nursery, transplanting, field management, guarding against birds, and then in harvesting activities.\r\n\r\nWith profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

Seeing the problems faced by women subsistence farmers in obtaining seeds and other farm implements, Haja started a small agro-business shop where she took some seeds and fertilizers on loan to be sold to the farmers. She also supplies seeds to some NGOs, but at a small scale.  With cash loans from SMT, she was able to expand her stock, but still more needs to be done. Haja is now discussing with SMT how women subsistence farmers can get access to loans so that they can expand their farm land and produce more food for sale and for consumption.

In those next three years, she continued to take loans to brew wine and breeding pigs.  Last year, she was able to rebuild her house.

She dedicates herself to caring for the children and to her studies from Monday to Friday.  On the weekends, she tends to her farmland where she cultivates potatoes that she plants for her own consumption since, as she tells us, what she buys at the market is not enough.  She likes farming because, since she was a young girl, she was raised in this environment.  Her parents were farmers and, for her, this activity has been the primary source of income.  The items she grows are indispensable to the daily menu.  The difficulty she has is that her partner does not enjoy farming, so she undertakes her activities on her own.  This is her 7th loan with MFP.  With the funds she is requesting, she will hire laborers to help work her land.  Each worker charges 15 soles per week, and she calculates she would need 20 people.  The remainder of the funds would be used to purchase herbicides.  <p>  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":224216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Hire laborers to help her work her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-11T13:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1313.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011276}],"funded_date":"2008-11-11T17:27:40Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":77956,"name":"Maria Teresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Teresa tiene 61 a\u00f1os D. edad, pertenece al Banco Comunal Bellavista II y vive en la calle Los \u00c1ngeles 799, distrito La Esperanza, provincia D.

These schools, WCSL Mabanta and WCSL Makama, were established by the Wesleyan Church of Sierra Leone. Since both schools from the villages of Mabanta and Makama operate on the same payroll, they have merged to seek a loan from Kiva through SMT.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be the second loan WCSL Mabanta will be receiving from Kiva through SMT. The previous loan that WCSL Mabanta received from Kiva through SMT created a tremendous impact in the lives of these teachers. Because of the successes of the first loan to the teachers of WCSL Mabanta, WCSL Makama from the next village has decided to join their colleagues in seeking a loan from SMT.\r\n<p>\r\nWCSL Mabanta was established in 1970 to give formal training to the children of Mabanta village and its environs. Over the years, this school has produced a great number of lecturers, teachers, and many other professionals in different walks of life. Presently, the school has 368 pupils with a staff of 10 teachers.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, some of these teachers will start a small business and those who are already running small businesses will invest the loan into their business. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children in their education or pay for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in home-building projects.  \r\n<p>\r\nFifty-three year old Solomon S. K. (right) is the headmaster at the school.  He was born in a village called Rogbin. He is married with three children \u2013 two of whom are in Junior Secondary Schools I (JSS I) and the eldest is in a Teachers Training College pursuing a Higher Teachers\u2019 Certificate. Solomon will use his loan to buy house-building materials like corrugated iron zinc, boards, stick and nails. Solomon\u2019s greatest desire is to see the completion of the house he is constructing. Being able to complete building his house will relieve him of the many problems tenants suffer at the hands of landlords, he told me.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4300,"image":{"id":286222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy house-building materials like corrugated iron zinc, boards, stick and nails","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-03-13T00:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4300,"lender_count":102,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Solomon S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David B.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isatu A.

Some of them trek to other towns to sell on their market days as well. <P>\r\n\r\nThe members have been in business for some time and have amassed a great deal of experience in their businesses. They are therefore asking for the loan to help them procure more goods to be able to expand their businesses.

district of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali). \r\n\r\nShe dropped out of her 5th year of primary schooling (education system in Mali) in order to help her mother, who used to sell condiments.\u00a0 After several years of apprenticeship with her, Fatoumata enjoys a great deal of experience in the commerce of various goods, especially firewood and charcoal, which she has been selling for four years.\u00a0 Being the only seller of firewood in her district, she is in high demand.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nConcerned about satisfying her customers, who grow in number from day to day, she decided to turn toward Soro Yiriwaso 30 months ago.\u00a0 After three solidarity loans and an individual loan, all correctly repaid, she is now on her second individual loan.\u00a0 She intends to use it to buy six truck loads of firewood.\u00a0 She stocks up in the village of K\u00e9l\u00e9kou from rural suppliers possessing a permit to cut, issued by the competent authorities.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nFatoumata sells to customers composed mostly of women, cash or credit accepted.\u00a0 Among her customers are also a few men, who are roast cooks.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nThus, with this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 50,000 francs CFA, which will enable her to repay her debts, to help her husband cover family expenses, and to provide for herself without any

Abdumanon is a diligent and tenacious farmer who strives to meet his family\u2019s needs. He is widower, and thus he carries the burden alone through his farming income to meet his family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nAbdumanon works on a 1-hectare (2.5-acre) farm owned by his parents. His harvests are sometimes not maximized because his cultivation method and seeds are not the best. Better farming supplies, seeds and fertilizer require a larger capital, which he didn\u2019t have.\r\n\r\nAbdumanon is now relieved that IMON International is helping him obtain the loan he needs to improve his farming. This loan will be used to buy superior seeds, organic fertilizers, and pesticides. He is waiting for his next harvest, which he hopes will yield better results than his previous harvests.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Merlyn has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Merlyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merlyn is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional plastics and other recyclables to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Merlyn from HSPFI.

He lives in his own home together with his wife, 46 year-old Martha who is a saleswoman, and their five children.  Their children are all grown up and work.  Together they all work hard every day to get ahead in life. From a young age, this hard-working man learned to make jewelry (necklaces, earrings, bracelets) from different precious stones.  When he had to support his family, he didn't hesitate to continue with this work.  He currently produces all kinds of jewelry wholesale and he sells, to order, to the large stores in the city. \r\n\r\nAparicio is very satisfied because he makes regular profits which have allowed him to get his family ahead.  In addition, the work is relaxed since he does it from Monday to Friday, in the mornings and afternoons.  He works alone, since the rest of his family work in other jobs, and he delivers his goods once a week.  However, as he is a hard-working man, he has many plans for the future such as increasing the quantity of goods that he sells in order to improve his profits.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that Aparicio has had from MFP and he pledges to make his repayments on time as he doesn't want to disappoint the people who made this support possible since it will allow him to continue working in search of progress.
