Six of his children currently attend school, while four children have graduated from school. He owns a house that has neither electricity nor piped water. He explains that his greatest monthly expenses are for food and school tuition fees. <p>\r\n\r\nTo earn a living, he operates a goat meat business. Specifically, he buys and then sells goats at the market to nearby butchers. Charles's primarily challenge as of late has been the high cost of transporation. In the future, he hopes to expand his business (and to solve much of his transportation problem) by establishing a slaughterhouse. Charles is now seeking a loan in the amount of 40,000 KES ($500) to purchase goats for re-sale purposes. He decided to join Yehu because it enables him to access financial services.

He is from Mali, and growing up, he never received an education. He is a 36-year-old married father to four children aged between eight months and 14 years old. Only one of his children is currently attending school. His partner stays at home as a housewife.<br \/><br \/>Bakary earns a living by raising livestock. He is taking out this loan from RMCR in order to purchase rams. He gets his supplies from the local livestock markets then resells his rams in town. He has been doing this for over 12 years.

With her first loan from GHAPE she purchased similar items and did well repaying the loan. With the proceeds from her last loan she expanded her business.\r\n<p>\r\nBridget mentions that she lives in tough circumstances, always \u201csuffering in the hands of thieves.\u201d She also had to experience the passing of her child. She wants to be able to provide for her children now. With the profits from this loan, Bridget wants to pay for her children\u2019s school fees and hopes to continue expanding her business. GHAPE loans are good for Bridget because the conditions are agreeable to her.\r\n<p><br>\r\nAbout GHAPE<br>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

He earns his living by selling fish, and owning and operating three motorcycle tricycles, a rice farm and a fish pond.\r\n\r\nRomulo\u2019s wife, Erlinda, helps him run the business.  They have eight adult children who also help in increasing the family income by engaging in driving of the motorcycles. \r\n\r\nRomulo joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 in the hope that he would be able to improve the quality of life of his family. With the help of his loans  from NWTF-PD, he has been able to increase his family's income by engaging in fish vending, driving three tricycles, and running the rice farm and a fish pond.  Now, he earns an average monthly income of Php 90,000 from his business activities.\r\n\r\nRomulo is a member of good standing. His previous loan of Php 29,000 was used to fund operations of his fish pond, rice farm and fish vending, and had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now, he is borrowing his seventh loan in the amount of Php 29,000, which he  intends to use on the fish vending business and motorcycle operations. Romulo is working hard to achieve his dreams and aspirations for his family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of  thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program,  NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\" -- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":446456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She states that the loan has had a positive impact in that it has brought about an increase in sales.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":595131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy dairy products at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-10-02T07:10:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Xiomara Del Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":269.51},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":363.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":379.53},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":387.15},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":401},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":426.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":439.62},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":454.14},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":459.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.48},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.16},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.98},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.36},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.32},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.98},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.71},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":13.48,"local_amount":269.51,"processed_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":290.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177382707},{"amount":18.16,"local_amount":363.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":391.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182520309},{"amount":18.98,"local_amount":379.53,"processed_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":408.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188654681},{"amount":19.36,"local_amount":387.15,"processed_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":416.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191397803},{"amount":20.05,"local_amount":401,"processed_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":431.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195815972},{"amount":21,"local_amount":420,"processed_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:39:09Z","rounded_local_amount":452.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201258376},{"amount":21.32,"local_amount":426.42,"processed_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":459.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206125154},{"amount":21.98,"local_amount":439.62,"processed_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":473.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211197005},{"amount":22.71,"local_amount":454.14,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-16T08:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":488.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216475455},{"amount":22.96,"local_amount":459.3,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T07:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":494.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221638344}],"funded_date":"2010-10-04T19:16:26Z","paid_date":"2011-08-16T07:55:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":232906,"name":"Lucy Wanjiku","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy Wanjiku is 44 years old and married to Samson Kamande, who is a teacher.

After eight solidarity loans (group loans), all of which were successfully repaid, she is now in her fourth individual loan; previous loans have been successfully repaid.\r\nShe intends on purchasing four bags of onions, three packages of soap and many other small articles with this loan. She gets her supplies from Koutiala's great market and retails cash at the market in Kouloukoro, to a clientele mainly composed of women.\r\nBy strengthening her commercial interests, she hopes to make an average monthly profit of 105,000 FCFA, which she is planning on using to repay Soro's loan interests, to participate to the family's expenses, and to support herself and her children.

She started supporting herself at 19, working as a cleaner and opening a general store in a space in her parents' house.   She's sold lots of merchandise since then and was able to save enough eventually to buy the land where her store now sits.  She is a determined woman and says that perseverance is the key to success.  She is pleased with her business now and with the income that it's generated.

is an entrepreneur who works with a small team of socially minded partners to improve lives for farmers throughout Kenya. Her work involves training farmers and building market linkages with suppliers of environmentally friendly products that are needed within local communities. Over the last several years, Joyce has worked with thousands of low-income farmers that grow tea, coffee, flowers, and vegetables. She started Boma Safi Limited to support the many farmers who lack access to sustainable energy and products that alleviate poverty. \n\nThe Boma Safi product line now includes solar energy solutions, as well as clean cookstoves, water purifiers, and women's health products. These goods are sold directly on farms, as well as in rural open-air markets and two small shops that Joyce now operates. Boma Safi (meaning \"clean home\" in Swahili) has quickly built a reputation as a trusted voice in the East African Fair Trade community.\n\nJoyce leads a small team that conducts workshops on farms across Kenya, demonstrating the positive aspects of solar when compared to traditional energy sources such as candles, kerosene, and disposable batteries. With years of experience selling a variety of solar products, Joyce began working with One Degree\u2019s team in Kenya in 2012 after collecting feedback from farmers about BrightBox, a new solar energy kit that powers lights, phones, and radios. During workshops, farmers would exclaim \"stima!\" - meaning electricity - when seeing BrightBox lights in action, and Joyce knew she found a winning solution.\n\nSince September 2012, Joyce has already sold hundreds of BrightBox systems to farmers. She already has requests for many more, which she would like to provide before the holidays. While happy with her initial success, Joyce has been selling to farmers on a regular cash basis, while many others cannot afford to pay upfront. These same lower-income farmers are sadly stuck spending $10-$15 per month - a considerable portion of their income - on lighting and phone charging.\n\nTo break this cycle and provide renewable energy to these farmers, Joyce would like to start offering flexible payment terms to those who need it most. She seeks support from Kiva lenders to make this happen.\n\nJoyce will use funds for 150 BrightBoxes, which will be used to energize and empower farming households across the region. Farmers will be able to collect BrightBox systems immediately and pay for them over several months. Since they are currently spending money on polluting, unsafe, and inefficient energy, most will save enough to recoup costs in 4-5 months and never worry about fuel or fire again. With your help, Joyce will help farming families eliminate energy expenses, improve safety, and allow their children to read into the night."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1255500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"to pay for solar energy systems and offer financing plans to lower-income farmers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Naivasha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.716667 36.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":276,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":7500,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":7500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":7500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":856604,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce is a 28-year-old lady and a married mother of three whose husband provides additional income for the family.\n\nJoyce operates a salon, a business she has done for the last nine years, and it's flourishing as depicted in the uploaded photo of Joyce plaiting one of her customers.\n\nThis marks her first borrowing from VisionFund Kenya to finance her business.

I Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<P>The women from the mujeres Chuacante group live in a popular tourist destination, San Pedro La Laguna, Lake Atitlan. They enjoy their community and are proud to have lived in it since childhood. Amongst the highlights of living in their town is the fact that they all own land there and enjoy a healthy church life and festive season, such as the town fair coming up in early June. The microcredit group that they are part of has brought them closer to each other through \u201cunity and love amongst us,\u201d as Norma G. described her experience.\r\n<P>\tWhen at home or in the workplace, these women, who are mostly mothers, dedicate their lives to weaving. Some are bead-workers and others are dedicated to selling fruit and vegetables.  The weavers make traditional clothing such as colorful belts, aprons and tops (guipiles) and the bead-workers make bead belts and bracelets. They sell this merchandise to intermediaries who take it all over the region and re-sell it to stores, tourists and shoppers. \r\n\t<P>Norma G. began her business a few years ago and took out very small loans at high interest. Recently, she has switched over to loans of virtually no interest, which are generously provided online. She can now confidently take out large loans (and growing) of 340 USD and with it help pay the wages of her 6 employees who work with her to produce many more products than before, and sell them for cheaper, while still making a profit.\r\n\t<P>When asked about how their business was going, they complained about the rainy season and the drop in sales during this time of the year. They said that this lull in sales didn\u2019t mean less work, but a whole other load to be taken care of.  The credit that they receive from microlenders goes towards more cloth and string, which they can buy by bulk and get a cheaper deal. At the same time, they can invest in their business to produce better and more products. Secundina E. said that she \u201ccould see a difference\u201d from the time she began to take out loans. She explained that she could now buy more, for less money, and realize larger profits. \r\n<P>\tThe hard work, combined with the loans, allows them to successfully send their children to public school, and accomplish what Josefa B. described as one of her largest dreams: to create a successful business and make it grow to the point where loans are no longer needed, and financial self-sustainability of the family and business are reached and maintained."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":179518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, \r\n\r\nscientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), \r\n\r\nFirdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The \r\n\r\ncountry is home to communities that still speak the ancient \r\n\r\nSogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th \r\n\r\nmillennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the \r\n\r\nIslamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central \r\n\r\nAsian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A \r\n\r\ncivil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the \r\n\r\nU.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, \r\n\r\n93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is \r\n\r\narable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of \r\n\r\nunemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work \r\n\r\nin other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of \r\n\r\nTajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity \r\n\r\nand the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the \r\n\r\npopulation still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with \r\n\r\nKiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients \r\n\r\nrepresent viable business prospects.

He breeds livestock, which provides sustenance for his humble home. Shodmonkul is married with three children. It's important to note that since he started his business, he has acquired an abundance of experience and knowledge because of his great dedication to breeding his animals. Shodmonkul is looking for support from IMON International to purchase livestock to sell in order to continue with his arduous work with cattle in his sector.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/p>\r\n<p>Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She\u2019s been farming for eight years; raising potatoes.  She also raises alfalfa, which she needs to feed her Guinea pigs, which she raises in a dedicated area at her father\u2019s home.  She also has cows which produce milk that she sells each day.  This income helps to support her family and also allows her to invest into her land in order to increase her production.\r\n\r\nShe sometimes gets help from her father, but she usually does the work herself.  It makes her feel very satisfied, especially because her sales of Guinea pigs and potatoes are increasing.  She tries to plant more varieties of potatoes because it\u2019s more profitable.  Her goals are to industrialize her Guinea pig farm and acquire more extensions to her land.\r\n\r\nThis will be her seventh loan through MFP and she is very happy to know that she has some financial backing.  She has proven to be responsible in making her payments and she really enjoys being part of a communal group because all of its members are responsible and very supportive.  She also very much appreciates the people who will make this loan possible, which will be very helpful to her business.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to buy lumber and metal fencing in order to expand her farm with new sheds for her Guinea pigs.

She lives in the house she owns with her husband Salvador (52-years-old). They have two young children and everyday the family works together to get ahead. For several years this hardworking woman has sold cakes and kekes (pastries). She began working out of her house, selling pacifiers, yogurt, candy, and everything else you can imagine because she's always been willing to help her husband earn money for the family expenses. After two years she took the initiative to study baking and since then she's opened her own business. That's how she found herself making cakes, pastries, and ice creams. She enjoys her occupation and she offers the most delicious desserts to her loyal customers, who are primarily shopkeepers from the neighborhood stores. As soon as she makes her products they're sold. To increase her production she teamed up with a friend to sell a greater quantity. She couldn't do it all on her own. \r\n\r\nThat's how the days pass for this hardworking woman who's always looking to improve her business. She's planning to to buy a new oven in the future so that she can sell her cakes, kekes, and other products to big commercial centers in the city. This is her 13th loan with MFP and she promises to make her payments punctually, as always. She's very grateful to everyone who's made this money possible. It will allow her to continue working in search of progress. Mar\u00eda plans to invest the loan in wholesale ingredients that she needs to make her desserts because she has various orders to complete and in this way she hopes to improve her income.

She lives with her 3 dependent children and her mother.  Together they work hard every day to get ahead.  This hard-working woman's day begins with the first rays of light since her business is selling hot drinks and it can't wait.  She moves her special unit to the corner of a busy avenue and there she begins, at 5 in the morning, to sell 'emoliente' (a traditional, medicinal drink), 'quinua' (quinoa drink), 'ponche de habas' (hot drink made from bean flour, milk, water, sugar, vanilla, cloves, cinnamon), and 'maca' (similar drink but made with 'maca' \u2013 a native root vegetable).  The last two drinks are energizing drinks.  She finishes at 11 in the morning.\r\n\r\nOver time, Esther's customers suggested she sell food products too.  Since then, she also offers different sandwiches.  In the afternoon, Esther begins selling her hot drinks again from 6 in the afternoon to 11 at night.  She likes her work a lot since it makes her regular income.  As she is an enterprising woman, in the future she plans to expand her business.  She is already looking at selling another type of drinks which she knows will be very popular.\r\n\r\nThis is Esther's first loan with MFP and she promises to make her repayments punctually as she doesn't want to disappoint the people who made this support possible since it will enable her to continue working in search of progress.

She gives her thanks to the Fundacion for helping people who have the desire to start their own business and those who want to expand them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":892280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy coloured threads, blankets and ribbons to make traditional embroidered dresses, blouses and housecoats.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-11-05T15:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sebastina  Hermila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1520.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573274},{"amount":75,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784986},{"amount":112.31,"local_amount":1497.44,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1517.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193549},{"amount":75.19,"local_amount":1002.56,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1016.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263329920}],"funded_date":"2011-11-05T22:27:58Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":355898,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David, aged 36, is a single, hardworking businessman.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, the country has a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Its 12 members are very close and dynamic where it concerns group activities.  As a general rule, group members engage in different activities. Ms. Maria Elena, for instance, sells groceries in her neighborhood store and is able to support her three children with the business. Other members sell newspapers, detergents, cosmetics through catalogues and underwear, still others proviD. services in hardware, food, manicure, housecleaning and laundry. There is currently a lot of competition. The important thing, though, is that group members have regular customers who trust them and their services as they always fulfill their orders. Competition in sales is stiff, but the group\u2019s businesses are very profitable, though they require hard work, evidence of which is the fact that members work seven days a week. They are able to proviD. food and education for their families thanks to their hard work. The loan is to be used to add new product lines, to invest in fabric in wholesale quantities, to buy merchandise more in tune with current needs and to buy supplies to increase manufacture and improve on their products.  Even though this is the first loan the group requests, some individual members have previously participated with other communal groups. They already know how to manage loans and understand fully that by meeting their obligations they will be able to continue to grow and enjoy the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Montserrat Zuckerman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":390353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3375,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Deysi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Pura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1837.47},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1858.61},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1880},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1901.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1923.51},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1945.65},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1968.04},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1990.68},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2013.59},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2036.76},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2060.19},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":263.89},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":266.93},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":273.11},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":276.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":282.65},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.19},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":292.51},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.88},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":142012,"name":"Mayda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia Mayda, pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLLANKAY HUAYNA\u201d; ubicado en el valle sagrado de los Inkas, exactamente en la provincia de Urubamba.\n\nNuestra socia tiene a\u00f1os de edad, 33 a\u00f1os de edad y es madre soltera,  tiene 2 hijos, la socia alterna sus actividades del hogar con el comercio minorista, ella vende cosm\u00e9ticos en el municipio de Urubamba, nuestra socia vende por cat\u00e1logos y luego los distribuye a quienes le hayan pedido, espera al d\u00eda de pago y los visita nuevamente a sus clientes y cobra lo que le deben.

It includes six members, who know each other and are neighbors: Felipa C. R. plans to use her loan to buy merchandise, including avocados, apples, peaches, guava, and loquat fruit to stock her store; Anabel Z. C. will buy chemical fertilizer for her nopal [prickly pear] to get it to grow; Alberta Arag\u00f3n Noriea will buy chemicals to fertilize her crops and increase production; Martha Graciela Mart\u00ednez M. will buy products to make her nopal grow better; Benita V. will buy boxes of avocados, and spray to increase the plants' production; and Gudelia Ch\u00e1vez G. will repair her chainsaw by changing the chain, spark plugs, oil, gas, etc. \r\n\r\nMartha Graciela Mart\u00ednez M. is a member of the group.  She is forty-years-old and completed the third year of secondary school to get her certificate.  She has seven children: Sandy Paulina, twenty-one,  is in her first semester of a degree program in physical education; Roberto, twenty, is in his fifth year of a degree program in economics; Brian, eighteen, is in his first semester of a degree program in economics; Brandon, fourteen, is in his third year of secondary school; Guadalupe, twelve, is in her third year of secondary school;  Hugo, six, is in his second year of elementary school; and Argelia, five, is in kindergarten.\r\n\r\nThe loan Martha is seeking is to buy produce, including nopal, avocados, peaches, lemons, custard apples, tomatoes, and guava.  She is very excited about this loan because it's the first one she has requested.  She's in business selling nopal, avocados, peaches, custard apples, tomatoes, and guava, and she also grows the nopal.  Martha is married; her husband works three days a week as a van driver, and the other four days growing nopal, weeding, hoeing, and spreading seeds.\r\n\r\nMartha started her business ten years ago out of necessity.  Between the kids growing and their education, there was a growing financial need.  Plus, the kids sure are good students.  Martha also grows nopal.  It's a good business, but the season is ending, and after five good months, prices are dropping.  She sells in the  Xochimilco market, traveling an hour to get there.  She stocks up on peaches and avocados at the Abastos Cuautla Central Market in T\u00e9tela del Volc\u00e1n.  Her business is important because it's a source of income, another means of support. In addition, she knows the people who come to her house from the country to buy her fresh produce.  She gets great satisfaction with the nopal she and her children grow; they participate, too, and everyone works together Saturdays and Sundays.  Her children help her cut lemons, avocados, and guava. She feels very proud that she has been able to buy two computers: one for the little ones in grade school, and one for the high schoolers who have now gone to college.  \r\n\r\nMartha has plenty of customers; they seek her out because she's got pickled nopals that are delicious because she makes them with so much love.  She gets about sixty customers per day.  Her business is popular for the tastiness of the pickled nopal.  The challenge is that in the Xochimilco market there are other vendors selling the same products.  She spends her profits on transporting her kids to school, and for their clothing and shoes.  She would like to expand her business.  She's saving a bit of the profits to add some new products like lettuce, papalo herb, and cilantro.  Her hopes and dreams include seeing her children win out so they don't suffer and wind up in the countryside.  The goal is for them to finish their studies and find work.  This loan will  help because she bought fertilizer for her nopal seed, and bacteriacide to fight spots on the nopal.\r\n\r\nMartha likes Tlalnepantla because it's beautiful and serene, and also for its hills and history.  She says that Pancho Villa came and drank with his animals from an underground spring that runs through the hills.  Regarding Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad she says, \u201cThank them, and tomorrow introduce my children who have their degrees already, so we don't come across poorly.  Ask them to keep supporting all the people who come knocking at their door.  And I'm really asking God to keep this going, so that more people can benefit from loans because the help is really needed.\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":621718,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer for their nopal so they can produce more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TLANEPANTLA MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-10-26T01:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gudelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2506.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415409},{"amount":200,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2506.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415410},{"amount":200,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2506.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554987},{"amount":440.91,"local_amount":5511.36,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5525.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691477},{"amount":322.62,"local_amount":4032.71,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4042.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430661},{"amount":296.27,"local_amount":3703.42,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3712.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195849943},{"amount":72,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":902.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292520},{"amount":268.2,"local_amount":3352.51,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3360.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160893}],"funded_date":"2010-10-26T13:30:32Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":245238,"name":"Alba Nidia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alba Nidia tiene 3 hijos y trabajan de manera independiente.

in the central city market. There are few other businesses selling similar items in the market where Shahlokhon has her kiosk. Because of this, customer demand continues to grow all the time. Shahlokhon has established a reputation as an entrepreneur with integrity. \r\n\r\nShahlokhon is requesting a loan for 5000 TJS to re-stock her inventory before the fall season. Compelling prices, along with a wide range of fashion and fabric choices to suit every taste and lifestyle, will attract many new female clients to her business. An increase in sales will help her generate more profit and expand her trade even more.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is caring for his 5 beloved children.  They live together in his own home in the Kimbiri district.  Honorato fulfills the role of father and mother due to his family's circumstances.  Since he was very young, his parents instilled in him how to work on the small farm.  He is a country-person and depends on a plot of land with pineapple plantations.  Honorato has been working for 23 years on his own land.  During the harvest times he counts on the support of his children and day laborers to make progress more quickly with the extraction of the fruits.  What he likes the most about his job is harvesting the fruits from the plants, since he feels that the challenging months provide him with compensation for the quality of his fruits.  He considers that the most difficult part is transporting his products from the small farm to the city of San Franscisco, the place where they give him the best prices for his products.  He is asking for the loan to be able to buy more pineapple plant seeds and to be able to exchange them for the coffee plants, because the pineapple fruits generate a better income and in less time.  This will be his 3rd loan with MFP.  He knows that if he pays it on time, he will be able to obtain another loan with greater ease, and he will not bring complications to his communal bank.  With the 2,000 nuevos soles, he will buy more pineapple seeds in order to improve his farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":980573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy more pineapple seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-19T07:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Honorato ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2019,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455468}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T22:20:45Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Danielle Dupre","image":170204}},{"id":987751,"name":"Philemon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Philemon is 22 years old.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

P., age 37, lives in the Gal\u00e1n neighborhood in the city of Barranquilla.  She is separated and has a 15 year old son.  She now lives at home with her family, where they sell lunches and cold drinks.  It is a family business.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan for 2,000,000 COP to buy drinks, refreshments, and supplies for food that she makes during special times like Carnaval.  This is when neighborhood families organize a party in the street and have fun safely.\r\n\r\nThey started the business selling bananas and vegetables in the entrance of a supermarket.  She sold the place because they started paving that affected their sales.  She then went to the market in Barranquilla where she established her business of selling economical lunches liked stuffed potatoes, rice with chicken or dried fish, rice wrapped in a leaf with meat, chicken, egg, and vegetables.  As they are now restructuring the market, she moved again in order to set up the family business in a stable place.  They sell lunches, refreshments, and everything having to do with fried food from her father\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nBesides her business of selling food, Sandra learned how to use industrial sewing machines in training given by Sena (National Service for Learning).  The Santo Domingo Foundation arranged for her to take the course, and she achieved a higher level of efficiency on the machines.  She also took a business course, and she realized that it would be very expensive to buy the industrial sewing machines and set up all of the structure to launch a business.  That is why she does not have her own seamstress shop.  She dreams of one day being able to have the money that will allow her to buy the machinery to create her own clothing business.  That is why she works hard, but also happily and dynamically.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

He learned this business through family tradition, as his family has been in the same line of work ever since they lived in his hometown of Bucaramanga, a place also called \"the city of parks,\" which is located in the department of Santander del Sur.  Although he has been building up experience since he was 15 years old, he had always worked in the family business.  A year ago, he became independent so that he could generate his own income, because as he is an adult with a 1 year-old child, he had to start thinking about the development of his family with his wife.  His main challenge is that he doesn't have enough capital, and this makes him less competitive since he loses customers.  This is the reason that he is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing that he has gotten through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the loan, he will buy accessories for shoes and materials and supplies such as uppers, soles, insoles and buckles in large quantities so that he can get a bulk discount.  But above all, he will be able to have a greater assortment of items that will allow his new customers to have a better view of his business.

Aziadekor is married and has six kids in his care, some of whom are in school.  Of the six children, five are biologically his.  He alone takes care of the children's different expenses.  Aziadekor has never been to school.  He has fished for 35 years, to provide for his needs and for those of his children.  He buys fish nets and wood (acadja) at the Dantokpa market in Cotounou, and does his work in a Cotonou lake.

Her hard work is to generate good income to strengthen her home's wellbeing. In addition to making fried foods and selling beer, as already mentioned, she also makes clothing in all types of fabric and styles as well as curtains. She does clothing repair as well. GRadually, her food business has grown and she needs to buy a fryer to make the preparation of her fried food easier. She also needs to buy ingredients such as oil and beer in bigger quantities to get discounts and pass on the savings in her products. This is the reason that she has taken out a Kiva loan. Her working capital isn't enough to do it with. Her financial indicators show that her business is stable and conditions are favorable for investment. Her goal and big challenge is to increase her sales in order to have more family income and continue to support her children achieve their goals.
