It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a hardworking lady. \r\n<p>\r\nFlavia makes chicken feed from fresh animal blood, shells and bones. She employs people to go to Lufula slaughterhouses to collect the fresh blood in cans. She boils this with ingredients from Ugachick Poultry Breeders Limited in Gayaza, as an independent producer. Once done, she sells to Ugachick itself, although the payments take two weeks to come through. This is one reason she also sells to other firms that pay instant cash for her to remain in business. \r\n<p>\r\n Her previous loan helped her renovate her recently built house and now she needs a loan to help buy more raw materials for her business. She also wants to put a concrete floor in her house to get rid of the dust. She is very grateful for her previous loans and those to come.

They sell their retail ware at the Bougoula Heamu market and through home sales; they take cash or credit payments from a customer base of men and women. \r\nThe women envisage making an average monthly profit of 32.500 FCFA each, a part of which would be used for savings and their families' needs, and the rest would be reinvested in business activities. \r\nThey hope to maintain their collaboration with Soro Yiriwaso and its partner Kiva in order to improve their living conditions.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":440544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase various items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-05T15:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Barakissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":76050.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763606},{"amount":175,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-21T08:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":76050.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152440},{"amount":175,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":76050.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991282},{"amount":175,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-18T08:32:39Z","rounded_local_amount":76050.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021552},{"amount":175,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":76050.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746348},{"amount":175,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":76050.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778893}],"funded_date":"2009-12-16T03:47:36Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Danielle Treharne","image":null}},{"id":163130,"name":"Korb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Korb N. lives in Rolus village in Takeo province.

Inici\u00f3 su actividad de vender almuerzos hace tres a\u00f1os; inicialmente elaboraba la comida en su casa vendi\u00e9ndola a sus vecinos, hasta que uno de ellos le comentara que donde \u00e9l trabajaba no hab\u00eda quien vendiera almuerzos; fue as\u00ed como Margarita se instal\u00f3 en la Zona Industrial de Mamonal, lugar cercano a Cartagena que concentra  muchas empresas importantes del pa\u00eds.

R. is a businesswoman from Cartagena who has ambitious goals for her food business; she hopes it will grow to such an extent that her products will be known city-wide and that, some day, she will be recognized as one of Colombia\u2019s greatest businesswomen.  \r\n\r\nShe started her business selling breakfasts three years ago.  Initially, she made the meals at home and sold them to her neighbors until one of them mentioned to her that where he worked there was no one selling meals.  This was how Margarita set herself up in the Mamonal Industrial Zone, a site near Cartagena that concentrates many of the country\u2019s important companies.  She borrowed money that had to be repaid the next day to buy raw materials and prepare the lunches.\r\n\r\nGradually, her customer base grew.  Since the business needed an injection of capital, she called upon Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization to which she is grateful for giving her the opportunity to launch her business, to increase her income a bit, and to replace the money for that loan she needed to repay the next day.\r\n\r\nThis $2.000.000 loan is her second one and she will use it to buy ingredients for her meals as well as tables and chairs for her business.\r\n\r\nBecause the Fundaci\u00f3n has supported her both financially and personally, she feels very loyal to it.  Her previous loans helped her increase her profits and to expand her service area in her type of work with better quality service; she has two employees and she is happy because she is generating income in other homes like hers.\r\n\r\nMargarita considers her greatest challenge to be having to face life alone with her three children.  However, thanks to God she was able to overcome and today she is happy knowing that she is making the effort for her children to advance.  She has taught them that life isn\u2019t easy but that with effort, dedication and lots of love, one can reach one\u2019s goals.\r\n\r\nThis is her lesson.  It helps her to face difficulties as part of life and business.  For example, when sales are down and they barely produce sufficient income to meet basic needs of her family and her business, she forges ahead even if she has to delay reaching her dreams because she knows that the first priority must be to reinvest in her business so that she can be sure to provide for her family\u2019s support.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan,

They live together in a community located at the edge of the Peruvian jungle, where they have their own home.  Raul is a very demanding person.  Considering that he lived with little money and convinced his wife to increase the size of their farm land, since they worked in small parcels and the money they were making from the sale of their products was not enough.  Currently they produce a larger quantity of cacao and their profits have increased considerably.  He still feel that there are many things to be accomplished in this life, and for this reason he is planning to buy more farmland in the future from other producers, with the goal of planting other products such as coffee and citrus fruit.  He knows very well that he needs to move at a slow and secure pace, and works hard every day, takes good care of his crops so that they are not damaged by pests.  He works together with his wife for 10 hours of every day.  At planting and harvest times, he hires laborers to help him get his final product.  This is a second loan with MFP and he commits to pay his installments on time.  Also, he is eternally grateful to his community group for the organization and fellowship that they show in their team work.  Raul is planning to use the loan money to provide adequate maintenance to his fields by buying manure and fertilizer with the purpose of improving the quality of his products.    <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Bobbit, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":539838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" Purchase of fertilizers and supplies for the care of his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-14T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2057.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886416}],"funded_date":"2010-05-28T11:38:48Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Bobbit","image":null}},{"id":204696,"name":"God Is In Control Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther N., who is holding the sign, is the leader of a group of five borrowers called \"God Is In Control\".

C. is from the village of District 1. She is 41 years old. Salina is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI.

The official name of this borrowing group is Salina D. C. group.\r\n\r\nSalina is married and has one adult child. To make a living, Salina owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Salina has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Salina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Salina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Salina is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Salina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They live in Melitopol, which is a small town with limited options for finding work.  This is why Victoria used an opportunity, which presented itself to her in 2002, to get involved in selling children's clothing at the town's central market.  Her retail outlet is known to regular customers because a wide assortment of merchandise at affordable prices can be found there.  Currently, Victoria's working capital is 12 000 hryvnia.  She wants to use a loan in the sum of 10 000 hryvnia to purchase a winter selection of children's clothing.  Considering that Victoria is a single mother and has no other means to make a living, this loan will be a good help for her business and family as a

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They all live in traditional extended families and average 44 years of age and 5 children each.  They all live in the Bamanan Kin district of Markala (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). The group members do commerce in fruit, <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), locally-made fruit juices, soap, kitchen utensils, etc. \r\n\r\nConcerned about augmenting their working capital, the women decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their fourth solidarity loan, after having repaid the preceding ones.  This loan will be used to buy 21 bolts of Wax <i>pagnes<\/i>, a 300-count sack of soap, a cart-load of mangoes, seven parcels of calabash bowls, and some ladles.  The women resupply themselves with Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> at the grand marketplace of Bamako; with mangoes and soaps at the Diamarabougou fair; and with bowls and ladles at the Tona fair.  The goods are resold to a mixed customer base, cash or credit accepted, in the districts of Markala going door-to-door, and at the fairs of Diamarabougou and Sibila. \r\n\r\nThe women hope to realize an average monthly profit of 46,000 francs CFA that will be used for food and for covering the children's schooling costs.  Their ambition is to save money and to become wholesalers selling soap and livestock feed.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":322218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy various goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sayon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diaratou                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":76652.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020274},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":76652.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243030},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":76652.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678850},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":76652.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112640},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76652.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028207},{"amount":158.35,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":76652.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873545}],"funded_date":"2009-06-11T20:51:47Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":113722,"name":"Nh\u1eef Th\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec7t","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

Nevertheless, because she is a very entrepreneurial woman, she has also been selling food (barbecued foods, kebabs, and other regional specialties) on Saturdays and Sundays for the past 3 years.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes best about her work is the feeling of being active, as well as the ability to be profitable because revenues are constant.  Before, she would have liked to have had a minimarket.  This is her 7th loan with MFP.  She is happy to be part of a communal bank because all her peers are nice and accomplished.  With the funds from this loan, she will refurbish her rented rooms to offer her tenants more comfortable conditions.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julia Kastner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":430653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Refurbishing rented rooms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-19T19:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":299.27},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":318.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":322.95},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":338.19},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":355.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":365.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.74},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.03},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.37},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.29},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":104.74,"local_amount":299.27,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":302.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843219},{"amount":216.24,"local_amount":617.83,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":623.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734811},{"amount":8.29,"local_amount":23.68,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":23.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124146},{"amount":118.37,"local_amount":338.19,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":341.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959875},{"amount":124.29,"local_amount":355.11,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":358.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992720},{"amount":128.07,"local_amount":365.92,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:48Z","rounded_local_amount":369.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717504}],"funded_date":"2009-11-22T04:38:21Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julia Kastner","image":343837}},{"id":159000,"name":"Leoncie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leoncie is 38 years old, is married with four children, and she takes care of two dependents.

Fifty kilometers from the city are the ruins of Ingapirca, one of the most visited tourist sites for natives and foreigners in Ecuador. Azogues and Ca\u00f1ar are famous for its craftwork, especially for making straw hats and ceramic products. The people are cordial and very kind, including the community bank members who work hard every day to provide a better present and future to their family. Martha lives in the community of Zhizhiquin with her husband, who works at a sawmill they own, and their four children, ages 13, 11, 8 and 5, who are all in school. Together they have been able to build their own home through a lot of hard work and sacrifice. Martha has helped her husband at the sawmill for the past three years and also dedicates herself to household chores and caring for a cow they own.

It goes without saying that Farming, has from time in memorial, been the backbone of most business in Uganda. Many families subsisted on it to start other businesses, educate their children and to make ends meet. One individual who did not gloss over this reality is one high spirited 38 year married mother of 4, who goes by the name of A. Harriet.

For a person who describes herself as a hard worker, it is no surprise that her business has made progress through the course of the last 10 years. In a month, she has been making profits that have consistently totaled up to 600,000 shillings. Like any other business person who aims at making more profits, she is taking a long view with plans of transforming into a wholesale business.

She is a woman who is not afraid of the difficulties encountered along the way to her destiny.  She was able to raise her only daughter by herself.  She gave her daughter an education.  She separated from her live-in partner, and from that time on she has been in charge of her household.  She lives with her only daughter and her grandson in her own house.  Every day they share the desire and enthusiasm of getting ahead and having a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nJuana makes clothes.  She makes her own designs, and she makes clothes for her customers.  They always seek her out so that her magic hands will make their garments.  They have faith that she will do a very good job.  She has a small workshop in her house where she does all of her work.\r\n\r\nShe started her work 20 years ago.  She started making simple things.  With time and experience she decided to make more complicated things until she managed the good finishing touch that she now has.\r\n\r\nShe works alone, and she is more than happy to be doing what she likes.  Things are going very well for her.  She has a lot of customers who ask for her very often.  Also, when there are no customers she makes her designs.  That way she is able to sell in her free time.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning she felt of little use in her house.  She only waited for the money that her live-in partner earned from his work.  But, she decided to do something.  From then on she is more than happy to be able to do this work.  It has allowed her to live her life with a measure of comfort.  She now wishes to work more and more in order to be able to continue growing with this work.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she will have financial support through the loan that she was granted.  This way she will be able to firm up some plans she has for her business.  She pledges to be a responsible member and to make her payments punctually.  She wants to work well with her communal bank, where there are good references about being supportive and punctual\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1,000 soles to buy materials to be able to continue with her work.  Among the things she will buy are fabric, needles, elastics, and patterns.  This way she will be able to sew in greater quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":940792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking

Her husband, retired for 15 years with a meager and irregular pension, does not contribute productively anymore to household expenses. Thus, to deal with school fees and the teaching of the children, Mrs. A., in addition to her principal business - the sale and storage of cereals (millets, corn, and beans) - has added the preparation of \u2019Tchoukoutou,\u2019 a millet-based drink which is very popular with the local population. However, her limited financial mans do not allow her to develop and enlarge her business.

Mrs. Yenny used to work as a housekeeper and it was there that she first saw that the woman she worked for brought clothes, sheets, quilts and other products from Oruro as her business. This sparked her interest in the business and, with the help of her employer, she began to drive her on the trips to distribute the products in the markets in Santa Cruz. Three years ago she became independent and brings all the before-mentioned products to her home, which she inherited, where she has a small building she and her husband worked to put up.  Six months ago her youngest child was born and, because of this, she stopped traveling and her resources have begun to decrease. The loan she would like to receive from this organization would be of much help to allow her to start traveling and begin to increase profits once again.  Lately she is buying very little merchandise, but here in Santa Cruz she could distribute it all at once to the businesses with encouraging profits.  Her dream is to be able to bring a lot of merchandise like her former employer did and, in this way, finish the construction of her home and buy her own vehicle.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

(vendors) working in Thies, a city about 70km from Dakar.  The association, named after an important marabout (a religious leader in West African Islam), was founded in 2006 by a group of entrepreneurial women from the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood.  The aim was to help the members finance their small businesses through a revolving savings fund called a tontine, in which members contribute a small amount to the pot each month to finance one member's activities.  Today, the association has evolved to secure group loans for its members through cooperation with UIMCEC.  Groups of five are financed through 10-month loans in which each member receives an equal amount.  On the 20th of each month, the members of the association hold a meeting to collect the repayments.  Currently, there are 14 groups of women financed through UIMCEC.  Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is headed by Ms. CoumB. Faye, the president, and Ms. Oumu Ngom, the treasurer.  \n\nAwa B. heads group No. 3.  She has been selling perfumes and cosmetics for about four years.   Awa chose perfume sales as they sell quite quickly - currently, the Casablanca and Aqua de Gio scents are the best sellers, she says.  Awa is married and the mother of two children, aged 2 and 6.\n\nThe other groups members are: Mareme D., who sells detergents and soaps; Gnangna D. who has a small kiosk selling small items from perfumes to candies; Maimouna F. who has a small vegetable stall in the market of Grand Thies; and Aly T. who sells marmite cooking pots in the same market.  Each group member receives 100,000 FCFA in loan financing to bolster her respective activity.  This is the second loan for the group.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":466116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Perfumes","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

For the past two years, she has worked making skirts using embroidery and designs typical of her area.  Her husband supports her in this business, so they both work day and night embroidering and sewing using their only work tool \u2013 a sewing machine.  Once the items are made, she brings them each weekend to the different rural area markets to sell, as this is where she earns the highest profit.  She considers skirt-making to be profitable because there is a great deal of demand for the product.  As a result, she wants to have better tools and increase her production.  This is her second loan with MFP.  She is relatively new in her communal bank and in this short time, she has learned good lessons that have helped her in her daily life.  This is why she is grateful and renews her promise to make her repayments on time.  With the loan requested, she will invest in the purchase of fabric and spools of thread.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":770995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabrics and spools of thread of different colors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-18T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1518.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621236}],"funded_date":"2011-05-18T18:21:34Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen O'Connell","image":578556}},{"id":303075,"name":"Retamas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cRETAMAS\u201d iniciar\u00e1 su tercer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Villa Exaltaci\u00f3n, est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde tiene como secretaria a la se\u00f1ora Lourdes.

Now they look forward to nine additional months of more advanced learning, and each of them is eager to continue learning how to better manage her business.\nDo\u00f1a Maria Beatriz embroiders traditional clothing items and sells them on the street in local communities.

Bupe currently earns about US $210 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of USD 400 in order to purchase commodities such as sugar, salt, cooking oil, soap and rice in bulk. In the future, she plans to open a new business. Bupe thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase commodities in bulk for retail sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bupe A.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613678},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010757},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233043},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664834},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:31Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105546},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022671}],"funded_date":"2009-04-17T20:23:46Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T06:30:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":105562,"name":"Youssouf","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Youssouf Berth\u00e9 a 37 ans, mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de trois enfants,  il r\u00e9side avec sa femme et leurs enfants dans une grande famille traditionnelle \u00e9largie \u00e0 Sanoubougou I, un des quartiers populaires de la ville de Sikasso ( troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative de la r\u00e9publique du Mali).\nMonsieur  Berth\u00e9  est un m\u00e9canicien de formation qu\u2019il a appris aupr\u00e8s de son p\u00e8re garagiste.

He is 41 years old, is single, and lives in a rented home. He is very motivated to improve his life and to move forward. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo earn an income, he drives his taxi through the streets of Juliaca.

His taxi is usually occupied, such that his ability (or luck as he calls it) to find passengers has made his business able to generate the income necessary to cover his expenses. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat he likes the best about his job is driving. He has 13 years of experience with this activity, and this experience has helped him to get to know each street, avenue, and ally of his city. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor the near future, he hopes to buy a new car and to put it to work as a taxi. Olindo considers the most difficult time to work the very early morning as he has to withstand the intense cold, which makes the nights much longer. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP, and he knows that he needs to pay all of his installments on time and he is ready to do so. In his community bank, he is very responsible, as he doesn't want to cause trouble for the other members. The 1000 Peruvian Soles he seeks he will invest in the repair of some imperfections in his taxi, and therefore be able to offer better service to his clients. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michelle Harrison, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":331194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Repair of his taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-09T02:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olindo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990728},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211830},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641355},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080795},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:41Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996934},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":172.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842274}],"funded_date":"2009-06-15T02:54:40Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Harrison","image":180524}},{"id":117850,"name":"Juliet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliet sells kerosene, retail and wholesale, to her customers in Lagos state, Nigeria.

Oisha is 50 years old and is an admirable mother. Together with her husband (pictured), she has shown a great, diligent spirit and enthusiasm for agricultural work.

As a result of this, her work has been very limited, and her profits have decreased notably. Since Oisha now wishes to increase the quality of her products by purchasing fertilizers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the benefits she obtained she was able to pay for her advanced obstetrician studies, and those of her husband R\u00f3mulo.  Both are now parents of two charming girls and the wish of this hard-working mother is to build her house on the property that she bought with high hopes.  In order to realize her plans for which she works hard, Marisela appeals to your caring heart and requests a loan to buy the materials necessary to continue making her fine articles of clothing.  Let\u2019s support this excellent seamstress so she can continue sewing her elegant and distinguished articles of clothing.\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Laura Westin, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<p>\r\nMarisela es natural de la ciudad de Arequipa, pero por cuestiones familiares radica en Juliaca, proviene de una familia  humilde pero sus ganas de triunfar en la vida pudieron m\u00e1s que su condici\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica.

Kadiatou is married and the mother of three children, one boy and two girls. She was born on November 20, 1965 in Bougouni, a prefecture in the third administrative region of Mali. She lives in her husband's house, together with his co-spouse and their children, in the Noumousso neighborhood in Kadiolo. She sells wax pagnes (colorful African cloth), fabrics, and bazins (highly prized cloth). For three years, she's been owning a sewing workshop where she sews and sells clothing. She also offers sewing services. She's getting help from a tailor, who she pays at the end of the month. Kadiatou is also a teacher at Kadiolo's elementary school. She manages to do all these activities harmoniously.\r\n<p>\r\nShe's seeking her first loan from Kiva's partner, the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso, in order to meet customer demand. She intends to use it to buy 10 full sets of men's fabric, 1 piece of bazin, 2 pieces of wax pagnes, and other items. She gets her supplies in Bamako, the capital of Mali, and in Burkina Faso.

She has always given of herself for her 6 children and has tried to provide what is best for them.  As a widow, she has learned to assume new responsibilities and roles within her home.  Working in different businesses gave her the opportunity to acquire and construct other homes in her area.  She began renting out apartments, which is one of the most profitable businesses in her area due to the high demand for housing in her district.  For the past 5 years, she has handled the monthly billing to her tenants, who are very punctual.  She seeks to provide them with the necessary conditions to make them comfortable.  \r\n<p>\r\nFelicita would like to install additional bathrooms, improve the exterior fa\u00e7ade, and build additional units that can be rented out to single tenants.  Therefore, she wants to enlarge her building so that she can convert it into a lodging house in the future.  This will not only provide her with great financial returns, but it will also help numerous families secure housing.  Felicita is taking out her first loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and hopes to remain part of a larger group of members involved with the Institution who demonstrate responsibility and commitment.  Her loan of 3000 soles will be used to remodel existing rooms and construct new rooms for rent.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

On average, they are 48 years of age and have 6 children.  They live in the Bamanan Kin (Diamarabougou) neighborhood of Markala (4th administrative Region of the republic of Mali).  They know each other through bonds of neighborhood and of membership to the same traditional association of women of the neighborhood.  This association was formed by the NGO ROCAM II as part of their efforts to train in the dyeing of cloth, literacy, sanitation, etc.  These women of the Danaya group work selling various items and approached Soro Yiriwaso in the interest of satisfying the needs of their clientele.  After four successfully repaid loans, they are on their 5th group loan, which they plan to use to buy 10 pieces of wax for making batik cloth, 10 pieces of fabrics, six skeins of embroidery thread, 2 bags of sugar, 20 kg of ginger, 1 crate of lemons, 1 crate of tamarinds, 1 package of powdered baobab fruit, 1 package of powdered fruit juice, 1 package of flavored sodas and 68 loads of firewood.  They supply themselves in wax and in fabrics once a month in Bamako and occasionally in the big market of S\u00e9gou.  They buy sugar and ingredients for the preparation of local juices at the weekly market in Diamarabougou Markala and they buy firewood weekly at the market in Sarkala.

They have two children who are 10 and  13 years old. \r\n\r\nLorena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lorena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 21,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to stock more things to sell in her general store. She wants to continue to save up for the future security of her family, for her children's education and family needs.

He puts in a lot of effort in order to make his lands very productive.  He has been farming for more than 15 years, and has become very knowledgeable about the world of agriculture.  At harvest time and when he needs to weed his crops, he hires workers who help him get the most difficult tasks done more quickly.

She largely purchases according to her orders, but will occasionally buy in bulk when there are special offers. She averages around 400 orders a month. Catalina has also been working with Herbalife selling protein shakes and other products. She has been with them for four months now and prefers their incentives which are often cash bonuses. She has also been working part-time at a local NGO as a secretary.

These seeds are transformed into \"sounbala\", a  condiment much esteemed and used in African sauces. The n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds (obtained from a tall fruit tree which is protected by the laws of the forest in Mali) are hulled, washed and cooked for a long time, then pounded and washed several times to get rid of their peels and any foreign matter. Then they are cooked again and hermetically sealed in a rust-free container for two days, then stirred, shaped into balls, steamed and dried. The resulting sounbala is ready for consumption. They sell for cash and credit to a clientele composed mainly of women, out of their homes, walking around the village, and in the big open-air market of the town of S\u00e9gou, and on the banks of the Niger River beside the women who sell gourds. \r\n\r\nThey hope to make a monthly average profit of 17,000 F CFA which will be used to reimburse the loan and cover certain family expenses (soap, gasoline, and clothing). \r\n\r\nTheir ambition is to be able to build a house made of corrugated iron to live in. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":303370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchasing n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adiara                                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assoumahou                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata     Fata                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotimi         Tati     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimata\t                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maratou                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":210000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":36786.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621226},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":36786.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621227},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:35Z","rounded_local_amount":36786.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020188},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":36786.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242943},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-08-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":36786.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678667},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:51Z","rounded_local_amount":36786.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112558}],"funded_date":"2009-05-01T22:08:00Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}}]}
