He has a transportation business in his home town of Ivano-Frankivsk, Western Ukraine. Igor offers transportation services all over the territory of Ukraine. He\u2019s known as a very careful and experienced driver which is why he always has many clients. Igor started this business 8 years ago. Presently, his monthly income amounts to 7,000 Grivnyas. \r\n\r\nIgor is requesting an 11,000 Grivnya loan to do some maintenance work on his car and purchase a turbine.

She has been in this business for five years.\r\n\r\nThe business started because her mother taught her to bake at the beginning.  She had a bakery but had to close because she would sell on credit and then wouldn\u2019t get paid so she had to close and start a different business.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 to buy raw materials to make bread always keeping in mind that the price of these materials can rise.\r\n\r\nAnother member of the group is Jos\u00e9 Luis, 25.

She has 2 years of experience in this business.  Loreta needs a loan of 1500 WST to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 WST per week) to improve and\/or expand the business.\r\n\r\nLoreta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Loreta's 2nd loan with SPBD.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded South Pacific Business Development to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.  Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive updates on SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale up to 3--the higher the number, the better off the person.  The metrics are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":722828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

For five years, Remedio has gotten to know what his fellow community members typically look for. With this business, he makes a net income of around 10,000 PHP per month. He manages to keep his business going without any employees at his side.\r\n<br>To help him continue to operate his business, he is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP. He views this loan as a big boost to his capital, with which he is able to purchase necessary items to expand his product inventory. It is crucial for him to acquire whatever item his customers are looking for, and this loan enables him to do just that.\r\n<br>Life keeps on flowing, and while there is a positive look to it, it also brings challenges to Remedio. One of the uncertainties Remedio feels as he goes along with the flow every day is that he is not certain how they will survive each day, as there is still no concrete means of sustaining his business. One thing he holds to, however, is the business that he has. That is why he makes sure he meets every need of his customers so they will patronize his business and buy regularly from him. Even as he desires sustainability for his business, he prays for a good business space with a low rental rate. He longs deeply to see his children finish school and learn not just to go along with the flow but to make things happen. As a CCT community partner, he faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":778843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy assorted household items and accessories to restock his rolling store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Remedio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1447.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211195138},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2895.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474145},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:32:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2895.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636926},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.3,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3619.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005236}],"funded_date":"2011-05-29T08:34:16Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:41:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":306832,"name":"Ena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ena de 38 a\u00f1os convive con Jorge de 37, fruto de ese gran amor tienen cuatro hermosos hijos, quienes viven en su casa propia en el centro poblado de Puerto Mayo distrito de Pichari.

She is married to Lino, a security guard. She, together with her husband, manages the own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJennifer operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages, piecemeal, to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Jennifer earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 250 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJennifer hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to draw her family to God. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":849225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-08-19T21:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2123.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005401},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.99,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3537.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764569},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.04,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2831.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571690},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2122.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529240}],"funded_date":"2011-08-19T23:16:06Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":331426,"name":"Sarain","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarain, 43 year old, is a policeman earning $3 per day.

She had four children with her ex-partner, and they now are 32, 30, 26 and 24 years old respectively. The three oldest children are merchants, have already become independent, and have started their own businesses while the last of her children still lives with her and is the one who helps in the business. Maria is the owner of a well-stocked store that she runs in her own home. She also sells meats and sausages of all kinds. The location of her business is excellent, because it is in a strategic location in the city of It\u00e1. She says that since she was very little she worked selling products of all kinds such as fruits and vegetables that she brought with her mother from the Abasto market in the capital city to sell house to house in the neighborhoods of her city . Subsequently, and with great sacrifice, she managed to set up a small store at home that eventually grew and today is the best-stocked in the neighborhood. She dreams of expanding her business and one day converting it into a large supermarket. At the same time she hopes that some day her youngest daughter will be in charge of the business. At this time she needs a credit to buy more goods such as flour, sugar, rice, noodles, tea, oil, bread, soft drinks, etc. because the end of the year holiday festivities are approaching and sales

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

The official name of this borrowing group is Gina M.'s group.\r\n\r\nGina is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Gina owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing hairdressing & beauty services to local community members. Gina has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nGina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gina is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Gina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They have been working to succeed in the business of buying and selling traditional Guatemalan clothing.  Their parents taught them to do this kind of work, which they have been carrying out for 9 years.  They sell this product of traditional clothing in various locations in Guatemala, going from place to place to earn their daily bread.  They tell us that they are stocking more merchandise to sell in order to compete in the market, but they lack working capital and for this reason they came to the Asociaci\u00f2n ASDIR to support them

An investment of this magnitude should permit an increase in sales, elevating their standard of living, and offering the satisfaction of better socioeconomic conditions for their children.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":539279,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"BUYING MERCHANDISE TO SUPPLY HER 2ND-HAND STORE","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-05-12T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirtha Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.78,"local_amount":695.66,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":737.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151822077},{"amount":33.37,"local_amount":667.47,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":707.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159562087},{"amount":32.04,"local_amount":640.88,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":679.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770996},{"amount":35.04,"local_amount":700.76,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:20Z","rounded_local_amount":742.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204888},{"amount":31.44,"local_amount":628.58,"processed_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":666.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330584},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":706.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465740},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":706.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097880},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:04:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1413.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766159},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1413.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206078097},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":666.63,"processed_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":706.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211147210}],"funded_date":"2010-05-29T20:31:43Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":204404,"name":"Leonisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonisa B. is from the village of Minongan, Quezon Bukidnon.

Leonisa is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 12th loan taken out by Leonisa from HSPFI.

She is married and has four adult children.  \r\n\r\nTo making a living, Nga owns and operates a furniture-making business, specializing in bedroom furniture for local businesses and community members. Nga has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Nga joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Nga has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,944,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase additional raw materials to expand product offerings.   \r\n\r\nNga is now requesting a new loan of 9,184,000 VND, which will be used to purchase machinery to expand the business. The loan will be the sixth  taken out by Nga from SEDA. Nga plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n Nga l\u00e0 47 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

Once she has paid off this loan, she'll request future loans in order to continue the house improvements until completed, as the house will be for her daughters in the future.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pamela Carre\u00f3n, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":242911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy three doors and build a closet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chontales","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.083333 -85.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marbelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.44,"local_amount":848.7,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":857.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816795},{"amount":40.99,"local_amount":819.71,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":828.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351478},{"amount":100.35,"local_amount":2007.06,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2028.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929113},{"amount":141.27,"local_amount":2825.4,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2855.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110600841},{"amount":49.95,"local_amount":999.13,"processed_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123840572},{"amount":125,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2526.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128873545},{"amount":125,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2526.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136603568},{"amount":125,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2526.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639048}],"funded_date":"2009-01-12T01:47:47Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Carreon","image":90574}},{"id":84758,"name":"Did","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S., 41, resides in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia.

With this profit, she would like to support her little family.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":547047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"purchase of groceries for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Atakpame","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"7.533333 1.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":99,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Am\u00e9l\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":7330},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":7670},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":7760},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7810},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":8070},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":8230},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":8360},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":8565},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":8660},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":8950},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":9100},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":9495}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.52},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.14},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.46},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.72},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.9},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.2},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":208516,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This Kiva borrower is a 39 year old single man from Lebanon, living with his parents.

The three of them live together in their own home which is located in the city of Tarma.\r\n\r\nThis hard-working man started his business buying and selling sheep, cattle and pigs 15 years ago.

He covers Tarma-Palcamayo routes, thereby making an extra income.\r\n\r\nRolando is now thinking of acquiring a better car with which he can transport the residents of his town to the countryside.  He is also planning to acquire machines for cutting meat which will allow him to have a productive butcher's shop.

This money will be used to purchase more fish and increase his sales and earnings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary McKee, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":321677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-21T17:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Uldarico","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":151.24},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":156.13},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":163.54},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":170.08},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":175.9},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":183.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.93},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.65},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.24},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.93,"local_amount":151.24,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":161.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596281},{"amount":54.65,"local_amount":156.13,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":166.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990561},{"amount":57.24,"local_amount":163.54,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:21Z","rounded_local_amount":174.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211672},{"amount":59.53,"local_amount":170.08,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:26Z","rounded_local_amount":181.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641193},{"amount":61.56,"local_amount":175.9,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":187.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080633},{"amount":64.09,"local_amount":183.11,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":195.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996758}],"funded_date":"2009-05-21T20:41:36Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary McKee","image":355625}},{"id":113446,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth L., a 44-year-old mother of three children, has owned a rice farm with her husband since the start of their marriage.

in Kandal province. The members of this group will use the loan for various purposes. Mrs Saran P. is 60 years old and the village bank president. She is a mat maker and owns her own business. Since her business is doing well, she wants to expand it but she does not have enough money to buy the necessary raw materials to make the mats. In order to deal with this problem, she decided to ask for a loan for this purpose. She hopes to improve her family's living conditions with this loan. Mrs Saran P. has three children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory while the other is a farmer. \r\n<p>\r\nNineteen members in this group have end-of-term (EoT) loans, and the rest have monthly payment loans. In EoT loans, the borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. EoT loans allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

people, Elena and her 74 years old husband are used to be farmers since they were young. Parents of both were also farmers and that was their main source of income then. Elena has inherited a rice field from her parents however, she didn't have enough capital to maximize the land for a rice production (rice planting) business or any agriculture business. A piece of it was pawned to other people in the village to finance her only child's education until her graduation from college. In 2003, Elena decided to join Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI)and get a loan to finance her rice production business that had started in 1999. She also dreamed then to get back the land they pawned.\n\nEventually after Elena's seventh times of loaning from ASHI she has able to have savings and have made their farming business grew. Her 35 years old only child who lives with her and her husband has been so supportive to her. Her loan presently which is intended for getting back her pawned land and finance her rice production business, is supported and agreed upon by her family. They promised each one that they will be helping each other for Elena to be able to payback her weekly payment in ASHI on time.   \n\n

It was a key post along the Silk Road and was once ruled by Alexander the Great. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He carries out these activities according to the seasons in his area, since usually there are only two: winter, when he establishes his crops, and summer, when he secures the food supply for his livestock. These activities take up most of the hours of his day. He has received financing for seven loans, which he has used to expand his livestock herds and improve his production system, from simpler methods to more technologically advanced ones. With the current loan, he plans to buy three more cows, so that he can increase his production of milk and meat and thus provide improved sustenance for his family. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":512710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buying three dairy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Somotillo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10498.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201258113}],"funded_date":"2010-05-19T04:13:36Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:38:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":192145,"name":"Leonarda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leonarda tiene 52 a\u00f1os, vive con sus 3 hijos en su casa propia.

For 15 years, she has made a living selling prepared meals from a stand at the city's main market.  That's where she starts work every morning, providing breakfast and lunch to her loyal customers, all of whom are eager to enjoy the traditional dishes that Leonarda prepares for them.  Her children help her sometimes, waiting on customers, because this is a business that requires a lot of hard work.  To make the money she needs, she has to get up at 4 in the morning to prepare her meals, but she's learned to win over her customers with good seasoning and attentive service that have helped to keep the business profitable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  charcoal sales, vegetable vending and farming. Her husband Orlando, who is 38 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 10 and 11 years old. Mercelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mercelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy more stock so that she can continue to save up for her children\u2019s education & household improvements. Mercelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

In the small village of Sadova he works hard to care for his bees and to use their precious production as efficiently and creatively as possible. A Peace Corps volunteer originally helped him research and set up the foundation of his project several years ago and Petru has not stopped learning and experimenting since. Right now, for example, he is working on a new system for the wooden frame that holds the beeswax foundation inside the hive. Currently his operation has two branches: honey production and candle making. The former involves much attention to the health of his bees. In the spring and summer he takes his hives to the forest above his town to allow the bees to find nourishment from different varieties of trees as they come into season, thus creating differentiated honeys as derived from certain blossoms (separated according to the time period in which the bees were feeding). The honey is sold at the local markets as well as in stores, but it is difficult in Moldova to have a good and steady income from honey sales alone so Petru realized that diversification was important. The candle making side of the business entails many steps, starting with finding a steady supply of good wax. Petru wants to generate more of his own high-quality wax since the stock he recently purchased was in large part impure and brittle, but doing so will take some time and require expansion; he would like to work up to a larger scale, hopefully with around 100 families of bees. He works with his family, especially with his daughter who loves painting the finished candles with special paints to make them even more ornate, and sells the candles at stores specializing in crafts and decorative goods. Many local churches also buy tall alter candles from Petru since they know that he only uses high quality wicks and that the candles will burn well. Petru would now like to purchase more hives, to buy a stock of sugar-derived nutrition for wintertime feeding and to buy a supply of finer wax to ensure superior candles for his customers to use in the holiday season.

Daniel will use the money to buy coffee plants, which are very expensive at the outset but very productive over time. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":231168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"For the purchase of coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T02:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":463.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210607}],"funded_date":"2008-12-01T20:40:49Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Sultan","image":null}},{"id":80694,"name":"Juana Auxiliadora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":271099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To buy pieces of timber to make furniture for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T02:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cresensia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130777},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027566},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613567},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010646},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232932},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664725},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105449},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:48Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022594},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867843},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757044}],"funded_date":"2009-02-15T05:17:02Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Chang","image":null}},{"id":92982,"name":"Marlon Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Marlon vende juntos con su mama granos b\u00e1sicos, productos de cosm\u00e9ticos y refrescos, el tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en el barrio el pilar en la ciudad de Managua, el vende desde que tiene 15 a\u00f1os ayudaba a sus padres y inicio con ayuda de su mama, para obtener sus propios ingresos, y poder mantener a su familia ya que su esposa le tiene dos hijo uno de 4a\u00f1os y el otro de un mes de nacido.

Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow five times through the CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to add stock to her store. Her business lets her earn a profit of about $200 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for an 8,000 PHP loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying prime commodity products.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her store could eventually become a mini-grocery and prays for a peaceful and blessed family life. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is a 49-year-old widow and has six children who are 26, 26, 22, 14, 11 and 7 years old.  Four of the children go to school.  Carolina only finished sixth grade and did not continue school because of her parents' financial difficulties.  She lives in her own house with her family and supports her mother and granddaughter who live with her.\r\n\r\nShe has never left her hometown.  For more than 11 years, Carolina has worked as a teacher for the Ministry of Education.  She has no employees and has a salary of 4,500 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses.  She also saves some of this money in her bank account.\r\n\r\nShe has never had loans from other banks and learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also customers of this institution.  This is Carolina's third loan.  She is asking for 10,000 meticais, which she will use to buy construction materials (sand, stone, zinc sheets, cement and other items) to finish building her house.\r\n\r\nCarolina promises to pay off this loan on time to maintain her credit.  In the future she would like to ask for more loans to build rooms for rent.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

When she was a girl she sold cakes door to door. \r\n\r\nHowever, with time and savings she was able to buy her things and make her own desserts and cakes in her house.  She has a lot of customers.  The reason that she requested the loan is to be able to rent a spot to be able to sell her cakes there.  She wants the people who go to the town of San Juan del Progresso to taste her cakes and come back to see her.  \r\n\r\nShe would like to use her earnings to make one of the best pastry shops in San Jos\u00e9 del Progreso.  She wants this in order to have a better quality of life for her and for the people who she loves the most.  That would be her husband, Pablo, and her children; Brenda, Miriam, Lourdes, and Gustavo.\r\n\r\nThe other 12 members of the group are:\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda del Carmen-sells shoes\r\nElena \u2013sells food\r\nCatalina-to sell food\r\nBertha-to buy and sell clothes\r\nTeodora-to buy materials to make tortillas\r\nFabiola-sells footwear\r\nCelia- to sell clothes\r\nEleazar-will buy brickmaking materials\r\nManuel-will buy materials for the fields\r\nBeatriz-to buy chicken\r\nBrenda-to buy and sell shoes\r\n\r\nAll of the members of the Jos\u00e9 de las Juquilitas group give thanks to the team of workers at the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the support they have given them. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4675,"image":{"id":794944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to make pastry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Jose del Progreso;

She lives with her family in a two-bedroom house in Ntahbessi, a quarter in Nkwen, in the Mezam Division of the North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nTsiagu is a very committed and hardworking business lady who owns a store in the Nkwen market. Her hard work and commitment have earned her many customers who demand a variety of goods which she cannot stock with her minimal capital. With the help of a loan from GHAPE, she will be able to stock foodstuff like maize, beans, rice and groundnuts which are in high demand. She really believes that this business will be successful because she already has many customers, and has a committed and hardworking spirit.\r\n\r\nHer business is helpful to the community because she will increase the variety of goods in the market, making things readily available at moderate prices. She has been through some tough times in her life, such as the death of loved ones, ill health and poverty (which made it difficult to educate her children). \r\nWith the profit from her loan, she will be able to educate her children very well, and to feed, clothe and provide medication for them.\r\n\r\nShe  prefers a GHAPE loan because of the low interest rates, and also because of the training the staff offers. The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community in its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":870035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lives with two of her 6 children.  For more than 15 years now, she has made a living in agriculture and livestock.  She has enjoyed living in the countryside and breathing clean air since she was very young.   This is why she decided to make her home there and raise her six children.  Today, she only lives with her two youngest who also help her take care of the farm.  She plants potato, corn, and alfalfa which she sells at the market, and also uses to feed her livestock.  She owns two properties; in one of them she plants while the other rests for several months so that the earth recovers its nutrients and can yield a good crop once it is cultivated again.  This is how she works; she also works with her livestock, especially her cow, which she takes to far off pastures to feed in addition to the alfalfa she gives her to eat.

This community was destroyed by the civil war, so people live in old and burnt houses.\r\n\r\n Emmanuel\u2019s business is brick making. He molds bricks and sells them retail to those that are into renovation, since Lynch street was destroyed by the civil war. \r\n\r\nAfter making bricks during the daytime, Emmanuel\u2019s night business is operating his little tea shop. He also serves as a photographer to the residents of Lynch Street. Emmanuel started as a brick contractor and raised some money which he used to start up his own business and he has been working at this business for 9 years. He always has goods on hand and sells at an affordable price, so him has a lot of customers.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel\u2019s main difficulty is during the rainy season when the rain damages his bricks because he does not have a shelter. Emmanuel needs this loan to purchase more cement in order to produce more bricks that can serve his customers and also to build a shelter to work under and that can also protect his bricks. He hopes to have a big business, if possible a company in the future.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel dreams of having access to funds that can help other people through his
