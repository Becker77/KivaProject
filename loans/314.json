She reports that her oldest son left home in search of a better future. Being both mother and father to her children is a difficult task which Juana has faced bravely since her partner, without caring about anything, abandoned them when his offspring were still small. \"To fill the pot,\" as she says, for the past 20 years she has worked growing potatoes (a Peruvian variety of this root crop), peas and corn. She has also raised various heads of livestock, two asses and some sheep and pigs. She reports that \"at first they confused me because I didn't know which one to take care of first, but now things have changed and thanks to God, my children are big and they help me at times, even when I am limited to preparing lunch because of the pains that plague me.\" She also says that she always likes to see her fields clean and neat because they are well-cultivated. She considers her work worthwhile because of the satisfaction and achievements it provides her in life, so that she wants to keep planting. In addition, it is the only work that she knows. She belongs to the \u201cLindo Amanecer de Cumutay\u201d [\"Beautiful Dawn of Cumutay\"] communal bank, and this is their ninth loan with MFP, from which she expects a small loan so that she can fulfill her objectives. She also promises to be punctual with her payments.

She is a widow and lives in a rented house with her 4 children. She has more than 20 years experience in knitting sweaters by hand. With the death of her husband, knitting has become her sole source of income and so she has concentrated her efforts into the knitting business. In order to optimise production and knit the number of garments she needs, she must hire other women to help her. This provides her with a substantial number of sweaters to take to wholesalers on consignment. Despite putting her entire investment at risk, she has known how to get ahead because during this time she has learnt how to manage her income and balance it with a desire to increase her working capital in order to stock basic raw materials. She is new to the communal bank she is a member of and was invited to join by her neighbours so that she could improve her business.

R. is part of the Communal Bank \"Las Rosas.\"  She lives in Jr. Guillermo Lumbreras Mz. 174 Lt. 3 del Distrito de Caller\u00eda.  Lucila is 59 years old and has 7 children.  Her husband works in agriculture.\r\n<p>\r\nThe first loan she received was for 300 Nuevo Soles, after 3 years of membership in Manuela Ramos.  At first she had a grocery store, but unfortunately it had to close.  Later, with her children she sold beauty products and built a small salon in her house.  Over time she has gained clientele and wants to continue moving forward.  Her most recent loan is for 2,000 Nuevos Soles.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This way she will increase her sales, which will be a big help in raising her baby.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":360932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Stock her store with artificial flowers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Cuscatl\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2009-07-29T21:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reina Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":850,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T11:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73556543},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T12:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86990271},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T13:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96902627},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103741852},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110629639},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118026587},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123865454},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128898281},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:46:13Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136626454},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144660520}],"funded_date":"2009-07-30T05:19:32Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T08:46:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":129988,"name":"Carmelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Carmelita B.'s dream is for her family to live a better life in Brgy. Carmelita is 38 years old and married to Mr. Francisco B.. Together, they are blessed with one child who is now attending college.\r\n\r\nWith a talent for business, Carmelita only needs an opportunity to test her entrepreneurial skills. This is how she convinced her husband to allow her to join the NWTF-Project Dungganon - so she could earn additional income for their small family. With the initial loans, she set up a \"sari-sari\" or general store which proved to provide a steady source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nBecause of her good performance as a member of the NWTF-Project Dungganon, she was able to access bigger loans which she used to invest in fishing. Later, she diversified these funds to purchase dried fish, locally known as \"uga,\" which she delivered around the community. With three businesses that generate income for her, Carmelita's net profit averaged approximately PHP 5,000 per month.\r\n\r\nThis new loan of PHP 25,000 is Carmelita's 25th loan cycle, which she wants to use as additional capital to buy more fishing equipment. With her child already in college, Carmelita is determined to work harder and earn more to support the education of her only child. \r\n\r\nThe attached picture shows Carmelita and Francisco B. inside of their \"Sari-sari\" or General Store.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few women but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

This is a beautiful region with very pretty scenery and tourist areas such as Tintay Panco, Inca\u00f1an, Bosque D. las Piedras (qampata), and Sopa D. Piedras in Ambato. The garments of the Chopcca are multicolored. The main activity of the community is farming (potato, onion, wheat, olluco) and a small quantity of cattle, pigs, and sheep among others.\r\n<p>\r\nTeresa A. is illiterate and lives in a very small house, she is father and mother to her three daughters, 15, 28, and 20 years old who study in the technological institute. All her life she has woven stockings and shawls, but due to an accident she had hearding sheep when she fell from a hill and broke her arm, she could not continue weaving and her business did not go well, and she needed the money so her daughters could study. With the support of FINCA Peru she got a loan and with the help of her promoter she moved ahead. She likes FINCA Peru because she finds much happiness with the promoters and partners. She has learned to save money and to have faith in others. It is her dream that her daughters become professionals and graduate. Teresa will invest the loan in buying more merchandise such as wool and offer work to her neighbor weaving stockings and shawls.\r\n<p>\r\nL. M. is married with three children, 2 months, 6 and 8 years old. She lives in her mother's house. L. sells gasoline and bus transportation between Huancavelica and Yauli and around the village. With her loans and savings she bought a second-hand bus which was on sale. L. is an old partner of Finca. Her problem is that her mother had a facial paralysis and almost passed away but her savings helped her. She got a loan of 500 nuevos soles from Finca Peru. The money will be invested in buying back tires and a jack for her bus. It is her dream to buy her own house and therefore she is saving money.\r\n<p>\r\nRebeca T. is married with four children, 6, 9, 11, and 12 years old, all in school with no major difficulty. She started this new business with a loan of 200 nuevos soles from Finca Peru selling wool garments and wool shirts. She learned to save money and prepared to become a good woman helping her sisters-in-law who are on their own. The money will be invested in buying more wool products in Huncayo. Her dream is to purchase a sewing machine and more looms, and to have a store selling synthetic and natural wool, \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lene Struck Christensen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":220460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"The 21 partners will invest in their businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:01:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3100,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorenzo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacinta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodosia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gliceria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reveca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luciano","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valeriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blacida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-16T23:09:58Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1583.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1583.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1583.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1583.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1583.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1583.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":516.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":516.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":516.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":516.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":516.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":516.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":516.67,"local_amount":1583.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:48:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1584.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932594},{"amount":516.67,"local_amount":1583.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1584.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10214890},{"amount":516.67,"local_amount":1583.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1584.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396620},{"amount":516.67,"local_amount":1583.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1584.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088395},{"amount":516.66,"local_amount":1583.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:04:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1584.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35981869},{"amount":516.66,"local_amount":1583.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1584.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442663}],"funded_date":"2008-11-02T23:09:58Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:52:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"lene struck","image":881505}},{"id":76742,"name":"Zoraida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Zoraida tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente, vive con su esposo y su hija.

She turned fifty last month and she lives with her husband and the children at Atebubu in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. The major occupation of the people is farming through which they derive their daily income to care for their families. <P>\r\n\r\nAkua is innovative and pro-active when it comes to business. She was once a farmer who was into the sale of cereals, but she realized that she could divest or venture into a more viable area to generate more income to support her family. So she decided to use the proceeds from her farm business to start her new business: the sale of clothing. <P>\r\n\r\nAkua travels to Togo, a nearby country, to purchase her goods. She says it is comparatively cheap to buy in Togo. She has been selling things like linens, clothes, and lace, etc. for six years now. She has a niche market and concentrates on the surrounding villages rather than serving the entire market. There are no competitors for her now, she says. And her reason is that she has not concentrated on the whole market so that competitors would monitor her.<P>\r\n\r\nAkua is requesting the loan to buy more materials so as to avoid frequent trips, due to the risk involved. She wants to make more income to provide a better education to enhance her kids' future career. She is a member of a group called \u2018The living God\u2019 Trust Group. Members agree to guarantee for each other as social collateral to repay the loan. Akua does not sell on group meeting days and her picture was taken during her group meeting.

Thus, if one person in the group defaults, the others in the group are responsible. It is important that all members of the group know and trust each other. This community of women has an advantage in that they already know each other well and trust one another. Since they have this strong foundation, they can build from there, talking and planning about how to improve their businesses. As the coordinator, Elba is responsible for facilitating these conversations and making sure that all the women properly use their loans. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of Elba, the Bank of Hope: Luz y Progreso,

of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHer husband dedicates himself to fishing for anchovies but, due to the times the anchovy fishing season was closed, she saw the need to work.  It was at this time that she started to distribute fish to the merchants of the area.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda and her husband travel to the Pimentel and San Jos\u00e9 harbors and, eventually, to the La Cruz cove (in the Tumbes region, located six hours from the city of Chiclayo) to buy fresh fish from the fishermen just off their boats.  They then transport their fish to the ECOPHINSA fishing terminal (the primary fishing terminal of the region) and sell them to the dealers of the area.\r\n\r\nPreviously, with earnings from her business, she started a small general store in her house that also generated income for their daily living needs.  However, her husband fell gravely ill with dengue fever on one of his visits to Tumbes.  She used the little money she had to pay for his treatment and, since then, she hasn\u2019t been able to maintain or stock her store.\r\n\r\nNow that her husband has recovered, she finds herself working with great enthusiasm to get ahead.  She plans to buy more products to help her fish distribution business to grow and to buy her own tanks (containers to store fish), since currently she rents them by the hour.  For this reason, she finds herself approaching Edpyme Alternativa for the first time to request a loan of 1,300 soles to help her reach her goals.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda\u2019s dreams include finishing the building of her house and stocking her store.  Her neighbors provide very good references for her, and consider her a good example since she was able to forge ahead despite her husband\u2019s illness.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":391024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fresh fish to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Santa Rosa - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-09-19T12:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Esmeralda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":105.18},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":117.57},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":119.68},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":127.12},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":134.19},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":135.27},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":144.31},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":148.49},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":153.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.41},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.7},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.43},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.96},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.4},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.41,"local_amount":105.18,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":105.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939724},{"amount":39.66,"local_amount":114.58,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":115.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780632},{"amount":40.7,"local_amount":117.57,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":118.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669532},{"amount":41.43,"local_amount":119.68,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":120.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065039},{"amount":44,"local_amount":127.12,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":127.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900153},{"amount":46.45,"local_amount":134.19,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:37Z","rounded_local_amount":134.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934288},{"amount":46.82,"local_amount":135.27,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":135.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661928},{"amount":49.96,"local_amount":144.31,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":144.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694644},{"amount":51.4,"local_amount":148.49,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":149.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877709},{"amount":53.17,"local_amount":153.61,"processed_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":154.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617762}],"funded_date":"2009-09-19T20:48:37Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":142350,"name":"Marben","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marben is married to Rose and they were gifted with a daughter named Marrian-7 days old.

She lives in a cement house with basic water and electricity that is located on the edge of  Guayaquil.  She is married but her husband is disabled.  She has 3 children but only one is studying and he is in law school.\r\n\r\nMelida began learning to sew when she was 26, and little by little this became her way to earn a living.  Now she uses her profits to help her children with expenses.  She works every day but she doesn\u2019t have a set schedule because she works at home.  One of the biggest  problems is the rationing of electricity so she needs to wait and work at night.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she wants to buy fabric,fringe, and other supplies she needs for sewing, and to be able to have more variety.

Nusula is 45 years old and she is a mother to six children. She says she joined this business with the persuasion of close friends. Before that, she was involved in a food sales business. The ten years have been years where she has not only learnt the fundamentals of doing business, but also learnt the ways and means of making it profitable and successful.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Lugazi is near Lake Victoria is an advantage in her business in that she does not have to spend much in transport costs. The fact that fish sells highly on the markets in Lugazi and the surrounding towns is also another merit. Her biggest challenge, however, is the tight competition manifest in this trade.

His brother has recently returned from the army and is also unemployed for the moment.\r\n\r\nEdgar has decided to add to his number of animals. This addition will help him to grow his farming business. He has requested a 1,000,000 AMD loan to buy a cow and purchase pig fodder. Adding a cow will help develop the business and add to the family's milk production. \r\n\r\nEdgar is a second-level client in Nor Horizon and has never been delayed in his loan repayments.\r\n\r\nEdgar is a very hard-working person and he likes his farming business very much.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Lo que le gusta de su trabajo es que conoce muchos lugares y trata con algunas personas que le ense\u00f1an t\u00e9cnicas y estrategias para aumentar sus ganancias en el tipo de labor que realiza. En la ciudad de Pucallpa, el principal medio de transporte es el motocarro, por ello, le es rentable, ya que el mismo maneja y administra sus ganancias diarias. Arturo considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de su trabajo es cuando no tiene en buenas condiciones su veh\u00edculo y no contar con un garaje para guardarlo. Con MFP, ya tiene 8 pr\u00e9stamos, y le gusta mucho trabajar con su banco comunal porque los integrantes son unidos y puntuales en los pagos.

For 7 years now he has provided transportation services with his own motor-car.  He works all day because he is a single father and wants to take care of his own needs; his children are now grown and have their own families.  What he enjoys about his work is that he gets to know a lot of places and he tries to learn from some people the technical aspects of his work and strategies for increasing the income he earns from his type of business.  The principal mode of transportation within the city of Pucallpa is by moto-car.  For this reason, his enterprise is profitable given that he himself drives his vehicle and administers his daily earnings.  Arturo considers the most difficult aspect of his business to be when his moto-car is in disrepair, and not having a garage to use for storage.  He already has had 8 loans with MFP, and he enjoys working with the cooperative bank greatly because the members are united and timely with their loan payments.  Arturo wants to invest the funds he is requesting into repairs for his moto-car, specifically for some replacement parts, for which he will spend 1,000 soles.  He will invest the remaining funds into his crops in order to have a good harvest.

He works as a delivery man at the ABAK bakery, but since 1991, he has been fattening sheep concurrently.  He has settled his first loan without difficulty.  With the current loan loan, he wants to bolster his business, that is, buying sheep to raise for a time and then selling them.  For example, if he buys eight sheep plus feed for 470,000 francs CFA, he can resell them at 720,000 francs.  He makes a good profit for repaying his loan regularly, and he's investing the rest in his business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She sells jewelry and a variety of merchandise like cosmetics, perfumes and accessories that are on sale through specialty publications, or that have been ordered by her clients on credit or with cash. She started this 8 years ago, when a friend first introduced her to a specialized magazine that sells clothing and then later to another catalog that sells cosmetics. She works with these two sales options simultaneously and it's going very well. She was able to buy a display case, stock it and organize a commercial area in her own home where she exhibits the jewelry that she buys on credit in downtown Barranquilla, along with other products from the catalogs that she wants to show her customers. \r\n\r\nMargarita earns important income from this business that helps her to manage her household, which consists of her partner and their 3 children ages 4 to 23. She dreams of seeing them organized and successful in the future. Her long-term goal is to increase her business, improve the infrastructure with display cases and to diversify the merchandise she offers including fashionable and affordable handbags. \r\n\r\nThe Kiva loan is her first from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will buy merchandise that is on sale in her catalogs because she knows the tastes and needs of her customers and she will sell these products to them at good prices, meeting their requests. Her biggest challenge is selecting customers that buy on credit, because she has to be very careful with new customers so that she doesn't lose her capital. She hopes to gradually increase her business capital with this loan and with a lot of discipline in her work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":779189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise that is on sale in her catalogs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T05:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":122997},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":129443},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":131924},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":134453},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":137030},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":144153}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.19},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.2},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.63},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69.19,"local_amount":122997,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":126264.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673777},{"amount":72.81,"local_amount":129443,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:07Z","rounded_local_amount":132881.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320336},{"amount":74.2,"local_amount":131924,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":135428.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803461},{"amount":75.63,"local_amount":134453,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":138024.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614538},{"amount":77.08,"local_amount":137030,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-26T08:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":140669.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568501},{"amount":81.09,"local_amount":144153,"processed_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":147982.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779845}],"funded_date":"2011-06-04T15:26:54Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":307056,"name":"Roxan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roxan is married.

She lives in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza, located in Palestine. \r\n\r\nHala wants to purchase new home furniture instead of the old ones to improve her family life and live in better conditions. Since she hasn't enough money, she needs to take out a loan of $1,215.05 from FATEN. \r\n\r\nWhen Hala gets a FATEN loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to purchase new home furniture, which will change her family life positively and let the family live in better conditions. \r\n\r\nHala is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead. \r\n\r\nAbout this loan product: \r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself.\r\n\r\nFATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. \r\n\r\nFor more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's article on <a href= \"http:\/\/na3.salesforce.com\/_ui\/selfservice\/pkb\/PublicKnowledgeSolution\/d?orgId=00D500000006svl&lang=1&id=50150000000SN1N&retURL=\/sol\/public\/solutionbrowser.jsp%3Fsearch%3Dmuslim%2Bworld%26cid%3D02n50000000DUOS%26orgId%3D00D500000006svl%26lang%3D1%26t%3D4&ps=1&pPv=1\">Lending in the Muslim World<\/a>. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":870388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase home furniture to improve her family's living conditions.

She lives in her own house with her spouse, 42-year-old Ernesto, and what she desires most is to improve her quality of life. She has spent 10 years cooking for patrons of her restaurant, which is located in one of the most central streets of the city of Juliaca. Her business is one of the most frequented spots because it offers a great variety of dishes--as she says, \"something for all tastes\". She would like to have a larger restaurant where she could tend to more customers. She really enjoys cooking for and conversing with her diners, but the difficult part is taking care of everyone who visits her restaurant because it is too tiring for her alone. This is Olga's first loan with MFP. She hopes to pay it back on time and without problems. She is well respected in her communal bank, as she is the most active and committed member.

Together with his wife, Mavluda Sobirova, he is involved in baking and selling flatbread.  Previously, Abdusodyk worked as a baker at a bread factory.  Much like many of his countrymen, he lost his job after the fall of the Soviet Union.  He has to work a lot in order to support his big family.  His knowledge as a baker came in handy, when his wife and he decided to bake flatbread at home and sell it at the entrance of the food market.  It was hard for them at the beginning because they did not have a permanent retail location.  Big retailers used to force them out of the market.

She is 22 years old, married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Maricel owns and operates a food stall. The main source of income for the business comes from selling farm products, such as bananas and vegetables, in the local community. Maricel has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Maricel joined Kiva partner PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital.

Kumushay lives together with her family in the town of Tokmok. Kumushay's husband works as an electrician. Together they have raised three daughters. Their oldest and middle daughters are twenty nine and twenty six respectfully. They are both married. The youngest nineteen year old daughter lives with parents. Kumushay helps her husband to support the family the best she can. When she was still young, the relatives advised her to start doing animal husbandry. It's very convenient to run this business from home. When she got married Kumushay did not ignore this advice and had slowly bought some livestock. Right now Kumushay has two cows and two calves and sells the milk. All these years Kumushay had the opportunity to have a good income from milk sales and had also gradually increased the head count of cattle and sold it as was needed. Her youngest daughter and husband also help Kumushay to take care of the cattle after work. This is why Kumushay does not have any difficulties with her business. Kumushay is very worried about her youngest daughter's future. She is now studying at the university. She needs to pay the tuition fees. Kumushay and her husband alone cannot afford to pay the tuition and family's expenses at the same time. This is why Kumushay has decided to apply for a loan. But she does not want to take the loan and spend it all on the tuition. For the start, she wants to invest the loan money to buy a calf; after feeding it she will sell it and use the income to pay the tuition fees. This will allow her to save a great deal of money. Kumushay wants to buy a house in the same town in the future. \r\n\r\nKumushay's group partners are: Zuurakan, Nurbek and Jyldyz.\r\n\r\nZuurakan is forty four. Her husband works as a taxi driver. Zuurakan is a housewife, she keeps cows and sells milk. They have four children. Zuurakan has come for a loan to buy a milk cow.\r\n\r\nNurbek is forty three years old. Nurbek's wife sells food in the store. Nurbek himself keeps cattle and sells milk. They have four children. The youngest daughter is only four years old. Nurbek hopes to receive the loan and invest the money to buy calves.\r\n\r\nJyldyz is only twenty. But she is already running a big business. She has married early and took part in her husband's business \u2013 farming. At this time she milks eighteen cows daily and sells 50 litters of milk. Jyldyz hopes to receive the loan and invest the money in resale of large cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She produces on average up to 20-25 loaves of bread and 8-10 kg of buns per day. <p>\r\n\r\nSodnomtseren started her bakery business in 2004.

She is 45 years old. Estrelita is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nEstrelita is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Estrelita owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Estrelita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately PHP 5,000 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Estrelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Estrelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of PHP 25,000 from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Estrelita is requesting a new loan of PHP 15,000, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Estrelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 23 years old and a woman who is very dedicated to her work.  She lives with 21 year-old Julio and they have three children.  They live together in their own home where understanding and mutual support reign.\r\n\r\nYanett's business is working the land.  She grows coffee and coca leaf.  In total, she has 3 hectares of land.  Yanett's parents taught her how to work the soil and she grew up with the desire to own her own farm.  She used some savings that she had made in order to fulfil her wish of owning her own plot of land.  Yanett knows a lot about the hard work of the countryside where she has been working for 20 years.  On harvest days she has the support of day laborers who transport her harvested produce for a certain stretch so that she can then sell it.  Yanett feels very dedicated to her work because, thanks to her daily effort, she can see that her plants are very productive and she makes good profits.  She tells us that she does not like the winter season because during those months insects abound which harms her yield.\r\n\r\nYanett is requesting this loan so that she can buy her own vehicle.  She will buy a motorbike for carrying cargo so that she can transport her produce to the markets more quickly.  Over time, she hopes to be able to buy more land and vary the crops she grows so that she can provide her family with good financial stability.  This is Yanett's eighth loan from MFP.  She has been very punctual in making her previous loan repayments and she hopes to continue being punctual in repaying this loan too.  Yanett is a very well-liked member of her community bank.  She will use the 3,000 Peruvian soles she has requested to buy her own vehicle, a motorbike for carrying cargo, so that she can transport her produce to the markets more quickly.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":741805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a motorbike for carrying cargo to transport her produce to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-31T10:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yanett ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3023.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621111}],"funded_date":"2011-04-02T03:51:04Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":290681,"name":"Perveen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Perveen is married to M.
