They have no children and live together in the house that they own.  For 16 years, along with Yolanda, Jose has made a living selling grocery products.  The business is located in one of the markets in their neighborhood.  The work is fairly easy because the experience of so many years has taught them what their customers want and what products they have to stock to satisfy demand.  Unfortunately, they can't stock all of their products at the market because thieves sometimes break in there at night and steal whatever they find.  Consequently, they keep most of their products at their house and only leave at the business what they have to.  They hope to improve the security of their market stall in the future, as well as improve the incomes they pull from the business.

D. has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 4.200.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 D. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. D. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6.048.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. D. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. The loan will be the fifth loan taken out by the borrower through SEDA. D. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nD.

She is 35 years old. Jesselyn is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Jesselyn runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for more than 18 years now. Her husband is a fisherman and she helps him sell his catch to their community. She also hopes for her husband's fishing business to grow.\r\n\r\nJesselyn joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jesselyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 Philippine pesos, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell and to buy fishing equipment. This will be the first loan taken out by Jesselyn from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business and the living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About CEVI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 72 years old, widowed and mother of seven aged between 32-52 yrs. She has been practising mixed farming for over 30 years. She produces maize, tea, coffee, sugarcane, and milk, which she sells locally. She has one employee. \r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan of Kshs. 45,000 from Juhudi Kilimo to buy a dairy cow.

Usaha ini sudah ditekuni sejak 2 tahun lalu. Pekerjaan ini diambilnya karena ia ingin meningkatkan perekonomian keluarganya sehingga ia akan mampu membiayai pendidikan anaknya setinggi mungkin. Tinggal di lingkungan pedesaan, sebagian besar kaum wanitanya mempunyai usaha beternak babi. Salah satu pakan yang sangat dibutuhkan adalah dedak padi. Melihat peluang ini, I Komang Dera memberanikan diri untuk membuka usaha jual beli dedak padi dirumahnya. Dengan modal tabungannya, I Komang Dera membeli dedak padi di penggilingan padi dan menjualnya kembali ke ibu \u2013 ibu di desanya.\r\nKarena harga yang bersaing dan kwalitas dedak yang baik, I Komang Dera mampu menjual dedak padi sebanyak 1 tons per minggu dengan harga beli per kilogramnya adalah Rp. 1.500.- dan dijual kembali dengan harga Rp. 1.600.- Jadi dalam seminggu ia bisa mendapatkan keuntungan Rp. 100.000.- Semua keuntungan itu ia pergunakan untuk kebutuhan keluarganya sehari \u2013 hari dan juga ditabung untuk persiapan biaya pendidikan anaknya.\r\nI Komang Dera ingin meningkatkan usaha agar lebih maju lagi. Ia memerlukan pinjaman dana untuk dapat membeli lebih banyak lagi dedak padi sehingga ia bisa meningkatkan keuntungannya.

in Kandal province, and they are seeking a loan for various business purposes. <p>\r\n\r\nMr. Phearak P. is the group's leader. He is a 23-year-old fisherman who is unable to catch fish because he does not have enough fishing equipment. To address this problem, Mr. Phearak P. is seeking a loan to buy a new boat and fish nets to re-start his business. His wife, Mrs. Chhoeurn Nary, is employed in a garment factory, and she earns a small salary to support their household. They have a 1-year-old child who is too young to work or study. <p>\r\n\r\nIn practice, this is a group loan, but the loans are structured in two ways: four members are seeking end-of-term loans, while the rest of the group's members would like monthly payment loans. With respect to the end-of-term loans, the borrowers are not required to repay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. Notably, end-of-term loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor population. Specifically, such loans allow borrowers to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Even so, most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term, and nearly all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. In fact, AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva loans.

What he enjoys most about his work is the direct contact he has with his passengers. His business is profitable because he is the driver and there is no need to pay an additional salary. This is his second loan with IMON International. Djahongir has proven himself to be punctual in his loan repayments. He will use the loan to buy one more minivan and will give his old minivan to his brother. In that way Djahongir will be able to improve the living conditions of his large family which includes his wife, children, parents and brother.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth  millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve the agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Additionally, she is considering purchasing a permanent post in the market from which to sell her goods rather than conducting her business from home.\r\n<p>\r\nSusana and her husband have four children, aged 17, 15, 13 and 4.

Now, thanks to the good income he has earned, he was able to install telephone booths and stock general goods. He works everyday, Monday to Sunday, selling rice, tuna, oils, telephone services, etc.\r\n\r\nWith this loan he wants to buy shoes, clothing, and make-up to better stock his business. In the future he wants to start other branches of his business and thus be able to buy a car for his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":467556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Shoes, clothing, rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-01-11T17:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"M\u00e1ximo Primitivo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73.47},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75.98},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75.63},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82.07},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83.65},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88.26},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90.21},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.47},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.98},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.19},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.65},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.26},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.21},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73.47,"local_amount":73.47,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":73.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910088},{"amount":75.98,"local_amount":75.98,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":75.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945653},{"amount":153.82,"local_amount":153.82,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":153.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674016},{"amount":161.61,"local_amount":161.61,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":161.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891376},{"amount":83.65,"local_amount":83.65,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":83.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845528},{"amount":85.78,"local_amount":85.78,"processed_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":85.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172111820},{"amount":88.26,"local_amount":88.26,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":88.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405238},{"amount":90.21,"local_amount":90.21,"processed_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":90.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182543735},{"amount":92.66,"local_amount":92.66,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":92.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680514},{"amount":94.56,"local_amount":94.56,"processed_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191378874}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T20:28:16Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T01:43:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":171719,"name":"Money Tree Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marie C. is a leader of a group of five borrowers called Money Tree Group.

They have six children ranging in age from 12 to 34 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nMerceditha joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired to something better for her family.

To make a living, H. owns and operates a business raising pigs for sale.

H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,600,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase feed and other supplies.\r\n\r\nH. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase baby pigs to raise and sell in future.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by her from SEDA.

C. is a widow who lives in Prk. Malipayon, Tabugon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a buy & sell livestock business. She has three children who are 16 to 20 years old. Procy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Procy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future family expenses & the education of her children.  Procy C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. Civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have a solid business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rosalia became aware of the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad through a neighbor, and it interested her so much that she dedicated herself to the task of looking for responsible people that she could work with.

Her family consists of her husband Jose and their 2 children who are school-aged.  For 6 years she has been selling clothing and shoes through a catalog, since for her what is essential is to have economic stability so she can provide a good future to her children.  Rosalia offers her merchandise to her neighbors, and they also recommend her to their friends and acquaintances.  She gets her products every 15 days, and she says that the majority of her customers are men, which is unusual, but true.  The times of the year she sells the most are when the children return to school and during holidays.  The loan she requests will be used to buy shoes, and with the earning she obtains she will buy school supplies and school uniforms for her children, since for her this is a good investment.  She plans to build her own house and in this way have the space she needs for her family.\r\n\r\nRosalia and the other members are very happy to have formed their group and to receive support from Kiva through the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, because this way they can start to work to accomplish their goals.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

She has many years experience in this business. Tauva needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Tauva joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Tauva's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

His son, Enhbat, is 11 years old and attends a local secondary school.  He and his family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic housing tent.  <p>\r\n\r\nWith his wife's help, G. operates a coal-selling business in his town.  Specifically, he purchases coal directly from local mines, and he transports the purchased coal (by using his large Russian truck) back to his town.  His wife then helps him sell the coal to various local businesses and individuals for use in heating.  G. has operated this business since 2000; by doing so, he has gained a great deal of experience over the years.  He explains that he has a large customer base, including many loyal clients, and that he hopes to purchase a larger truck in the future to keep up with growing demand.  In fact, he notes that his old Russian truck is outdated, and that individuals with newer, larger, more fuel-efficient trucks are able to generate higher earnings than he can, which is why he would like a new truck.  In the meantime, though, G. is simply requesting a loan in the amount of 1,000,000 tugrug (~$725 USD) to make necessary repairs to his truck and to purchase petrol so that he can transport more coal. <p>\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001 and listed its first Kiva loan in January 2009.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, giving Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

She is married to Jose P., an executive secretary, and is the mother of five children, one of whom is already working while one is currently enrolled in college; one is in high school and two are enrolled in the local elementary school. By the grace of God, Susan has managed to support her older children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her remaining children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Susan, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n<p>\r\nSusan operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP\u2019s-worth of cooking oil or an egg. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail piece rates. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<p>\r\nSusan is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages so as to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Susan dreams of being able to give all of her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work in her business. \r\n<p>\r\nSusan faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis. The fellowship groups gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":597031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more products to expand her product inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-09-09T22:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4000.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172089070},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2667.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380434},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2667.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816770},{"amount":15,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":666.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652719}],"funded_date":"2010-09-11T13:11:53Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Pierce","image":518671}},{"id":233758,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan C. is from the village of Malasin, Dupax Del Norte, Nueva Vizcaya.

In addition, he uses his time on the weekends to help his parents with their farming activities on a plot of land that they have.  Now, due to a relationship that didn't work out, he is single and is living with his parents, who he helps financially when he can.

She has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4.000.000 VND a month.\n\nIn 2009, S\u1ef1 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. S\u1ef1 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7.840.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase  some kitchen equipment to make her business more qualified to attract more customers to come. She is now requesting a new loan of 8.736.000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 2nd loan from SEDA. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to make improvements to her house.\n\n\nAbout SEDA:\n\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\n\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The members of the group decided to give it this name because it is the name of the district where they live.  Their district has this name because there is a water tank there.\r\n\r\nThis story is about Maricela Hern\u00e1ndez S. who is 27 years old and married.  Her husband is called Juan Carlos Bibiano and he is a construction worker.  They have four children: Juan Carlos, Alexander, Betzy and Jacqueline.  Only three of their children are in school.  Their eldest (son) is in his fifth year of elementary school, their second (son) is in his first year of elementary school and their youngest son is in his second year of pre-school.  Their youngest child (a daughter) is only one year old.\r\n\r\nMaricela has been selling donuts and empanadas for 5 years.  She decided to start this business because she says that she was looking for a way to improve her own quality of life and that of her family.  She also wanted to provide her children with a very good education and support her husband with their household expenses since there are occasions when he doesn't have work.\r\n\r\nMaricela invested her loan in buying more supplies such as flour, sugar, oil, cornstarch, milk, eggs and firewood so that she could continue making her snacks.  Maricela's dream is to build an oven in her home so that she can continue with her sales since she currently has to go to her aunt's home to make her donuts and empanadas.  She would also like, in the future, to build premises to set up a bakery so that she can have her business much better stocked and make more income and better income.  With this income she will be able to continue supporting her children in their studies so that they can have a very good professional career.\r\n\r\nMaricela is very grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva for the support of this loan that they have offered her since, thanks to the loan, her business will start to improve a lot and her own life, and that of her family, will also change.\r\n\r\nThe members of the El Tanque group and their businesses are as follows:\r\nRuth - selling perfume;

Desde hace 13 a\u00f1os atras Don Will se dedica a la venta de repuestos y reparacion de motocicletas, aprendi\u00f3 este oficio gracias a un primo de \u00e9l que tenia un taller y le permiti\u00f3 trabajar alli. Gracias a esa oportunidad, don Will aprendi\u00f3 muchas cosas y luego de un tiempo decidi\u00f3 aventurarse e instal\u00f3 su propio taller, aunque no le fue nada facil ya que no contaba con ciertas herramientas y tenia que andar quitando prestado y a veces se las prestaban y otras veces no. Pero con la ayuda de Dios y el apoyo de su familia ha podido salir adelante y ha comprado las herramientas mas necesarias para desempe\u00f1ar su trabajo. Actualmente uno de las dificultades que esta atravesando es que no todos los dias tiene trabajo. El prestamo que solicita don Will lo necesita para comprar repuestos como ser llantas, parrillas, aceite, grasa, cables, fricciones, etc. Espero que con el apoyo de este prestamo pueda surtir su negocio y asi ofrecer al cliente lo que el necesita.

He has four male children, two of whom live in the United States, and also a daughter who lives at home and devotes herself to her studies. For 13 years Don Will has earned a living selling spare parts and repairing motorcycles. He learned this line of business thanks to a cousin of his who had a workshop and allowed him to work there. Thanks to that opportunity, Don Will learned many things, and after a time decided to make a go of it for himself and set up his own shop. It was not at all easy since he didn't have certain tools and had to go around asking to borrow them, and sometimes they would loan them out and sometimes they wouldn't. But with God's help and the support of his family he has been able to get ahead, and has bought the tools most necessary for carrying out his work. Currently one of the difficulties he is going through is that he doesn't have work every day. \r\n\r\nDon Will needs the loan he is seeking for buying spare parts such as tires, grills, oil, grease, cables, brake pads, etc. He hopes that the loan will help him stock his business so he can sell his customers what they need. His goal is to stay healthy because as long as God gives him life and health, he will be able to keep working to support his family. For him, his family is the most important thing, and as long as they are together, any obstacle that presents itself may be overcome.

Currently Homid has plans to purchase 3 bull calves.  After fattening them Homid would be able to sell the young bulls for a profit. He needs money to purchase the bull calves.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

They are very close and have known each other for a while. They work in the following: \r\n\r\nEda Ventura C\u00e1ceres Z. works in grocery sales. A half a year ago she started a small grocery store, which operates under the name \u201cKensy\u201d. She has her business in the house where they live, and at the same time the store is a rented location because they do not own their own house. She is married and her husband works as a mason. They decided to start this business because the people who previously rented the house had a small grocery store and they took advantage of that fact to start the same type of business since the client base was already there. They have the goal that with the income that they both generate they will build their own house. At this time they only have a piece of land. \r\n\r\nRosa Elena R. G. has been working for 12 years making and selling tamales and hamburgers, which she does on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. She sells most of them in the street, and the rest from her house. Rosa is married and the mother of three children who depend 100% on the couple. Her husband works at a sawmill where he does welding work. Through her husband, Rosa has managed to sell her product inside the business where he works, and many of the employees that work there buy her product. Rosa decided to do this type of work because their economic situation is not good and her husband\u2019s income wasn\u2019t enough to cover all of the household expenses. Their living conditions have improved with the income that her business generates. She gives money to her husband to cover some of the household expenses.\r\n\r\nBlanca Lidia Gonzalez has been working as a seamstress for 17 years. She started out by selling used American clothing and when a bale came with very large clothing (XXL and larger), she would fix the items so that she could sell them and not lose out on the bale of clothing. Blanca now makes and sells thick blankets made of Dacron fabric. She buys the materials for making them. In the neighborhood where she lives, people say she is hardworking, honest and honorable, and of Christian principles. She has lived in the neighborhood for 19 years.

Louise was born in 1984 and for the past 25 years she lived in Fi\u00e9gnon \u00e0 Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. She is married to Dansou Jean, a fisherman. Louise is the mother of 3 children, all of whom attend school. Louise also has another child in her care, in addition to her own children. Louise lives with her children and her husband. It is principally Louise's husband who takes care of the needs of the family. Nevertheless, Louise uses the additional income earned from her business in order to help her husband support their family. Louise did not attend school. \r\n\r\nFor about ten years, Louise has sold \"Akpan\" (a local porridge made from corn starch) from her home.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fish vending and sugarcane field businesses. Her husband Wilfredo S. Sr., who is 59 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have 10 children who are all between 14 and 34 years old. \r\n\r\nEvangeline joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Evangeline has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000 - uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 which she intends to use to buy fishing gear and stocks for the general store so that she can continue to save up for their future and do home repairs. Evangeline S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":552983,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She is 35 years old and married. To make a living, Buenafe owns and operates a  sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Buenafe has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Buenafe joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Buenafe is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products for her shop. This loan will be the first taken out by Buenafe from HSPFI.

His income as a driver is unstable and depends on how many customerst he gets within a day. He can generate about IDR 75,000 to 250,000 in a day. But there are also times when he has to return home without any income. Moreover, his car often has problems so he has to stop working for a few days just to fix the car. There are some spare parts of the car that have to be replaced, but because the price is expensive, Bambang cannot afford it. He replaced the spare parts with cheaper ones, but the repair did not last for long. For this reason, Bambang is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 4,500,000 from TLM.

which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in the neighborhood of San Jose located in the El Paraiso department.\r\n\r\nEnma is a hard working person and a fighter in life. A few years ago, her husband abandoned her and her two children. In order to keep her small family going, she had to move to her parents\u2019 house. She began making a living in one endeavor after the other, but none of them went well, so she decided to look for employment and she found it. After a few years of working, she decided to begin selling catalogue cosmetics as an extra source of income. It has gone very well for her. She makes most of her sales through her work mates. On the weekends she goes out to the community to make her sales in addition to the few products she has for sale at her home.  \r\n\r\nEnma needs the loan she is requesting to increase and diversify her supply of products such as nail polish, lipstick, eye shadows, eyeliner and lip liner, creams, deodorants and perfumes among other things.

Roland M. was born on September 15, 1980 in Lom\u00e9.  Having styled his brothers, sisters and friends early with much attention and finesse, his parents pushed him towards this career.  He began an apprenticeship and never stopped wowing people with his great work.  Very dynamic and an entrepreneur, he was able to open his own salon just after his apprenticeship ended, thanks to a loan of $150 that he obtained and regularly paid back.  The efficacity and quality of his work makes him an excellent hair stylist in his community.  Facing clients that are more and more demanding, Mr. M. now feels the need to update his equipment in order to be line with their requests.  IN order to do this, he is asking for a $1200 credir to improve his salon and his equipment.  This credit will alow him to buy electric razors, hair dryers, wash basins and cosmetic beauty products.  Financing this young man to improve his salon will be a great encouragement for others in the community to follow in his footsteps and take charge of their own destinies and not fall into juvenile deliquency.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Chloe Tuot, a Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur M.

Five years ago she decided to dedicate herself to raising and selling hamsters to be able to provide for her family. She feels very satisfied because she has accomplished what she set out to do from the start, becoming the biggest provider of hamsters in the community. She did this thanks to the training she received through the local government, which she did with a lot of attention and has followed through on all their recommendations. Among her biggest dreams is expanding her business into the biggest one of its kind in the country. With this goal in mind, she also had been making food in the afternoons for them but could not continue because it was risky during pregnancy.

Mrs. Sophos K. is 39 years old and the mother of six children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory while the others are attending the local school. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting partly of end-of-term (EoT) loans. Three members have EoT loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Those receiving EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. Such loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. EoT allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":246194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery
