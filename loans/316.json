The loan will be used to expand her direct selling business. She plans to buy more Avon, MSE, Natasha and Boardwalk products so she will have actual products, in addition to the brochures she brings her customers. Julieta has already proven that having actual products with her is an advantage, which is the reason why she\u2019d like to avail of a loan.

She is married and has 5 school-aged children.  To make a living, Ana  owns and operates a business venture in the arts sector operating a handicraft business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling wood handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Ana  has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nAna  joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ana successfully repaid a previous loan of 2250 WST from SPBD, which she used to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  Ana  is now requesting a new loan of 2950 WST, which will also be used to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  The loan will be the fifth loan Ana has taken out from SPBD.

(vendors) working in Thies, a city about 70km from Dakar. The association, named after an important marabout (a religious leader in West African Islam), was founded in 2006 by a group of entrepreneurial women from the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood. The aim was to help the members finance their small businesses through a revolving savings fund called a tontine, in which members contribute a small amount to the pot each month to finance one member's activities.  \r\n\r\nToday, the association has evolved to secure group loans for its members through cooperation with UIMCEC, a Kiva partner. Groups of five are financed through 10-month loans in which each member receives an equal amount. On the 20th of each month, the members of the association hold a meeting to collect the repayments.  Currently, there are 14 groups of women financed through UIMCEC. Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is headed by Ms. CoumB. F., the president, and Ms. Oumu Ngom, the treasurer.  \r\n\r\nAwa N., the mother of six, is the head of group No. 2. One could say she is an international businesswoman: She travels several times per year to neighboring Mauritania to purchase shoes, fabrics and incense, bringing it back to Thies to sell door-to-door. She makes the journey most often at night, when there is less traffic. The small bus leaves Thies around 2 a.m., arriving just across the border around 8 a.m. Awa then takes the day to find the best deals, returning once again in the evening. The whole excursion typically takes about 24 hours. She says the prices in Mauritania are much lower than in Senegal.\r\n\r\nIssane F., another member of the group, agrees. She makes the same trip, often buying mobile phones, which can sell for double the price back in Thies. The other three group members are: Aissatou D., who sells guedia (dried fish); Codou Kair\u00e9, who sells fresh fish; and Awa B., whom sells monkey bread (baobab fruit), perfumes and other diverse items.  Each group member receives a 100,000 CFA franc credit to finance their activities.

They live together in a cozy home that they own, located in a commercial neighborhood of the city of Santa Ana.  Her occupation is preparing \"caldo de gallina\" (chicken boiled in pieces with potatoes, vegetables and noodles), pancakes, coffee and various foods of the area that are much sought after by discerning diners.  Her husband, on the other hand, works in public transportation using a motocar (light 3-wheeled passenger vehicle) that he owns.  In this way, together they can cover the household expenses and pay for the education  and basic needs of their children.  She has 23 years of experience selling food in the evenings from a food cart that she positions near a bus stop.  In addition, she has 3 motocars that they rent to third parties, and with all of these sources of income they live comfortably.  As she is a businesswoman, she wants to set up a bar in her home.  Her main wish is to have a poller\u00eda (chicken restaurant), that she could run along with her husband and sons.  This is the first time that she has had a loan from MFP, and she is very enthusiastic about belonging to a communal group that is so well organized.  In addition, she pays attention to the decisions made by the members of her group.  With the loan requested, she will buy soft drinks and some snacks.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":539903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy soft drinks and snacks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-15T00:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.13},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.13},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.12},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.12},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.13,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":88.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144752052},{"amount":31.12,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":88.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934515},{"amount":31.13,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":88.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673286},{"amount":31.12,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":88.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887112},{"amount":31.13,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:22Z","rounded_local_amount":88.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154126},{"amount":31.12,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":88.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449422},{"amount":31.13,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:59:51Z","rounded_local_amount":88.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588092},{"amount":31.12,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":88.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724709},{"amount":31.13,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":88.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462915},{"amount":62.25,"local_amount":165.76,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":176.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326707},{"amount":32.62,"local_amount":87.24,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":92.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195368}],"funded_date":"2010-05-16T19:23:20Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":204724,"name":"Kweterana Women's Group, Ntungamo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This friendly and very hardworking lady, K.

She lived with her late husband in a large household in the North Pelengana quarter of S\u00e9gou (the fourth largest administrative region in the Republic of Mali). She did not attend school, and so began working with her mother at an early age, selling condiments. After many years learning the trade alongside her mother, she began selling cereals eleven years ago and has established a good reputation for herself. She sells her goods at the chateau market, alongside other condiment stalls. Her booming sales are thanks to the quality of her goods which are held in high regard.  In order to generate higher profits, she has approached Soro Yiriwaso. She has been a customer of theirs for 54 months, and has received 3 community and 3 individual loans, all of which have been successfully repaid. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth individual loan, and she aims to use it to buy a ton of rice. She sources her goods from suppliers at Niono and S\u00e9ribala. Madame Catherine Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 takes cash and credit sales from a customer base made up of men and women. She aims to use this loan in order to generate an average monthly profit of 80 000 FCFA. This profit will enable her to see to her family's needs (food and housing), especially since losing her husband a few years ago. Her aim is to build a house to live in. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva

They have their own home located in the Pampa Miraflores community enclosed by the Santa Rosa district. Gloria and her partner, Elmer, are the support for their family.  Her parents instilled in her from a very young age to work on a small farm.  Gloria is a countrywoman and depends on 4 hectares consisting of coffee, barbasco, and cocoa crops originating from wild areas of Valle R\u00edo Apurimac. She has been working on those crops for 11 years.  During harvest season she counts on her children's and worker's help to finish quickly. What she loves most about her work is seeing the fruition of their months of hard work. She considers their biggest challenge to be the transportation of products from their small farm to warehouses located in San Francisco; the place that offers them the best prices for their products. They also have difficulties in making enough money to pay their workers in advance for having helped during harvesting season. This is why they are requesting MFP a loan. At the same time she will prioritize in growing more coffee beans since she has 1 hectare of land not in use. This is her eighth loan with MFP and she feels that this loan will help her progress greatly with her business. She is a well liked member of her communal bank. With the 1,000 Peruvian Soles loan she will hire workers to help her during harvesting season.

He\u2019s been in this line of work for 25 years and considers the fumigating to be the most difficult thing because he always runs the risk of the chemicals causing him some illness in the future.

In time, he wants to buy new land to increase production.\n\nThis is MFP loan #1.  He will be punctual with his payments. He will use the 1000 new soles to buy manure and insecticide to combat the infestations that take over his crops.\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":981802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy manure and insecticide.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-20T21:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455471}],"funded_date":"2012-01-21T06:59:16Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":385057,"name":"Journy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Journy is 30 years old, single and lives in Tapican, Liloy, Zamboanga del Norte.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her husband in a large traditional family in the second area of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nShe stopped going to school in the third primary grade (Mali education system) to begin several revenue-generating activities such as hairdressing, dying clothes, etc. She finally opted for traditional soap-making. She learned this trade from one of her acquaintances. After weeks of apprenticeship, she finally mastered the production technique and started her own business. She has been pursuing this activity for the past four years and has acquired a high reputation due to the quality of her traditional soaps.\r\n\r\nTo make traditional soap she heats 50 litres of Shea oil in a large pot or in a barrel. She then adds five 20-litre containers of water, five kilos of flour and four kilos of caustic soda. She then stirs with a large ladle until she obtains a paste-like consistency from which she will make the soap.\r\n\r\nTo increase the size of her business and to generate more revenue, she approached Soro Yiriwaso four years ago. Folllowing four group and two individual loans, all of which were fully reimbursed, she is now requesting a third individual loan. She will use this loan to purchase 30 barrels of caustic soda. She gets her supplies locally. Mrs. Binton Traor\u00e9 sells cash and on credit to a customer base of women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she hopes to reach a monthly revenue of 100,000 FCFA.

She is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both responsible for paying back the loan of the other group member if one is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nHelen is married and has 7 adult children. To make a living, she owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector planting crops. The main source of income for the business comes from the cassava and vegetables she plants and then sells in the local community. Helen has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Helen joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business. Helen is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used for house repair. This will be Helen\u2019s 6th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family\u2019s living standard. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Alberto is a very productive man; he is very dedicated to the work he does.  His work consists in tilling the soil; he\u2019s a coffee farmer.  He\u2019s been in this line of work for more than 20 years and hires day laborers to help him with harvesting so that he can extract the fruit more quickly.  He sells his production to gathering firms who pay well for each kilogram of product that he sells.  He considers the most difficult part of the job having to transport his products from his fields to the gathering centers located in the city of San Francisco.  For now, his main priority is to buy new land to expand his fields and increase production to provide his family with good economic stability.\r\n\r\nThis is his first MFI loan and he\u2019s willing prepared to make all his installment payments punctually because he\u2019d like to access a future loan later on.  He will use the 1500 new soles to hire day workers to help him remove weeds that are encroaching on his plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":981882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire day laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-19T00:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1547.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455473}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T03:54:19Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":754470,"name":"Allohagbe Group","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe ALLOHAGBE est compos\u00e9 de trois personnes qui fr\u00e9quentent la m\u00eame \u00e9glise.

For 13 years she has operated her business as a tailor in Myanga market in the Bungoma District of Western Kenya.  With 5 sewing machines and one employee, her business is comprised of a diversity of activities. They include buying clothes second hand, repairing them and then reselling; tailoring dresses and suits for individual clients; selling pre-made uniforms to primary schools; as well as training young women how to be tailors.<p>Anna is currently training 5 young women in the skill of tailoring. Charging her students 7,000 Kenyan Schillings per year, they work at the 3 extra sewing machines not being used by Anna or her employee. This is of great benefit to the community, as Anna is able to provide young women with the skills they will need to attain employment and open their own tailoring centers. Anna herself was trained at Naitiri Youth Polytechnic, but not all women have the opportunity to attend established institutions.<p>Anna gives the clothes that she repairs to her husband to sell at the market. The clothing includes Vitenge dresses and Kaunda suits, the traditional clothing in the area. Her greatest specialty that separates her from other tailors, however, is her production of ready made uniforms for primary schools. Whereas other tailors lack the ability to prepare ready made school uniforms, Anna has already established relationships with multiple primary schools that she sells to. Along with being another example of how Anna provides for her community, it also represents a consistent and stable demand for her products.<p>According to Anna, the greatest challenge to her business has been a lack of capital to meet demand. With her new loan, she will purchase the necessary cloths and threads to expand the capacity of her tailoring shop. With this increased capacity, she hopes to grow profits and continue to pay for her family's basic necessities, including food and children\u2019s school fees.<p>While primary education is supposedly free in Kenya, there are still many other expenses that families face, including uniforms, books, tests, school upkeep, etc. Moreover, the steep costs of high school education must be completely paid by families\u2014which makes secondary education a product of tremendous sacrifice, and in some cases an impossibility. Anna hopes that her business will ensure that her children can attain an education that will help them in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":40401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase material and thread to increase production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Myanga, Bungoma District","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":27,"posted_date":"2007-06-06T18:47:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna Aya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-21T01:48:48Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-07-21T09:17:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-22T17:04:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34117},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-08-21T09:17:28Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-22T17:04:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45002},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-09-21T09:17:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-22T17:04:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":57032},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-21T09:17:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-22T17:04:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70228},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-21T10:17:37Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-22T17:04:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":84524},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T10:16:59Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-22T17:04:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100507}],"funded_date":"2007-06-07T01:48:48Z","paid_date":"2007-12-21T10:16:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":15438,"name":"Orlando","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Mr. M. owns a brickworks located in a densely populated district of Managua called Mirna Ugarte.

He might get into livestock hauling, brush removal, firewood sales, fence building and hunting guides. Microinvest granted him a loan of 30,000 lei to purchase all the necessities.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":322289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

vegetables.  She lives in Narra, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her nipa roof making and vegetable farming businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Aurea is borrowing PHP 12,000 to purchase raw materials for making nipa roofs.   This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Aurea aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.

She is determined to remove her family from the darkness brought by poverty. She is widowed and has two children to take care of.\r\nWith her desire to earn an income through a business, in 1999 she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. Her loans were used as capital for her Sari-sari store (General Store). She is one of the outstanding members of ASHI . As her business is properly managed, it brings her enough income to sustain the needs of her family.\r\nShe is now excited to receive her loan of 25,000 pesos as additional capital for her Store.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The women of the committee are all working together, helping each other to reach their common goals. \r\n\r\nIt's a very supportive group, and they have worked hard to make sure they all repay their

Through their daily work, they are reaching this goal and little by little feeling proud of their accomplishments.  They live in the city of Cuenca which is a city noted for its charming historic downtown as well as its combination of three cultures rich in symbolism, tradition and art: Ca\u00f1ari, Inca and Spanish.  Communal bank member Ana P., 20, lives in the Miraflores section of the city.  She is single and lives with her parents, helping them meet household expenses; they do not own their home, they lease.  Ana works in an Internet caf\u00e9 from 8:30am until 7pm; she has worked there for 11 months and has done well.  She also sells women's beauty products of the Yanbal brand.  She began this work again 3 months ago; she had previously sold these products to her school friends.  She tells us that she does well because her customers pay on time.  Her goal for this new year is to start her studies again.  She gets along well with all the other members of the communal bank.  She has been managing her loans with the institution for 2 years now and they have helped her to buy Yanbal products and to help with the family rent payment.  She was encouraged to join the communal bank by her mother.  The new loan will be used to buy Yanbal products such as: perfumes, chains, make-up, etc.  Her goal is to become a physician.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She works daily as a cleaning lady in various homes in the area but six months ago she found an occupation that she likes a lot and that she can do in her spare time.  She makes all kinds of accessories for women like:  earrings, necklaces and bracelets.  She makes them with various kinds of stones which she buys at wholesale.  Her children then help her sort them, which allows her to move ahead faster.  She works in partnership with a friend, who's job it is to go out and sell the completed pieces.  Both her jobs produce needed profits which, together with her husband's earnings, pay for household expenses and education costs of the children.  For the future, Carmen would like to start to sell her accessories independently because she figures her profits would be higher that way.  This is her first loan with MFP and she promisses to be punctual with her payments because she is already planning to request future loans.  Carmen intends to use the funds to buy supplies to continue to make her accessories and to start to become independent.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":477128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-25T20:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":78.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":88.1},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":89.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":93.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":96.48},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":101.81},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":105.7},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":110.61},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":116.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":119.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.51},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.47},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.18},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.64},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.48},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.51,"local_amount":78.69,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":84.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960271},{"amount":33.04,"local_amount":88.1,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":94.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993115},{"amount":33.47,"local_amount":89.25,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":95.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717901},{"amount":34.98,"local_amount":93.28,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":99.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751576},{"amount":36.18,"local_amount":96.48,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":103.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934044},{"amount":38.17,"local_amount":101.81,"processed_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":108.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672821},{"amount":39.64,"local_amount":105.7,"processed_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":112.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886675},{"amount":41.48,"local_amount":110.61,"processed_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:04Z","rounded_local_amount":118.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153783},{"amount":88.53,"local_amount":236.08,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":252.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449191}],"funded_date":"2010-01-25T22:58:50Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":175667,"name":"Busaana Development Group, Lugazi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"O.

The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces.\n\nFarida works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 7 days per week and currently earns about 80 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more ingredients such as rice, wheat flour, maize flour and cooking oil in bulk for business.\n\nIn the future, Farida plans to expand her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\n\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":505302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more ingredients such as rice, wheat flour, maize flour and cooking oil in bulk for business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farida S.

What she likes the most is to look after her customers, who already know the quality of the chicken and pork crackling that she prepares, selling it every day, from 5 in the afternoon until ten in the evening. And so 20 years have passed while running this business, her work consisting of walking long distances selling food. Her daily task is to try to sell the 35 portions that she makes daily. On the other hand, her husband works in public transport, using a rented motorbike cart and the profits that he receives helps in the household expenses. Nevertheless Santos has to work hard to help her youngest daughter who is mentally disabled.

He is married and has no children.\r\n\r\nPatrick has requested this loan of 61,200 KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. He says this loan will help improve the livelihood of his family since he will be able to provide enough milk for domestic consumption.\r\n\r\nIn five years time, Patrick hopes to have acquired five more dairy cows and be a major supplier of milk to the Kenya Cooperative Creameries.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":605159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

They are micro-business people who work in the sale of clothing, natural products, shoes, etc., and in education in the city of San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for its ball players and for its sugar industry. Its present economy depends on the free-trade zone, the cement industry, and other lesser activities such as tourism. This member of Esperanza International is the mother of two children and began working with Esperanza International because she had the dream of having a little school in her community. She began the school with her first loan. Now it is four years later and she is receiving her tenth loan. For each loan she has made her payments in a satisfactory manner and she has made good investments. Through her business (the school) she makes a good contribution to the community, since she offers a good private education at a low monthly cost.\r\n\r\nPetronila is planning to invest her new loan in the purchase of children's school supplies and products for the school cafeteria. She will use her earnings to invest in her business, buying fans and doing more advertising, although now she has fewer students because of the economic problems of their parents. Her greatest challenge is being able to pay her employees, since at this time the school has less income. Her dream is to have more students and a better school with more teachers, and when she achieves this she will be able to help the most needy families -- at the least, she wants to help them in their education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":614860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

She lives in Poblacion, Basay, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1994 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $237. \r\n\r\nNelly is now borrowing 29,500 PHP so that she can purchase more inventory to sell. This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 29,500 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Nelly aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Since 2002, Sarah has run a business selling charcoal. These small pieces of black, dry earth are important to Sarah and her customers, who rely on charcoal to cook their meals. Many Tanzanians still do their cooking in small coal pots in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal pieces) and add paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene to light the flame. The fire requires constant fanning, which makes cooking a hot, laborious task. It may not be the easiest or most environmentally friendly form of cooking, but it is the only option many people can afford. This is good news for Sarah, who requires a loan of $875 to add to her stock of mkaa and continue meeting customer demand.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania, where customs and traditions normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets. Because they lack tangible collateral assets, women are considered not credit-worthy by financial institutions.

Trabaja arduamente para que luego de varios meses pueda obtener el fruto de su trabajo, la recompensa de su ardua labor, por ello se levanta muy temprano para dejar la comida lista y preparar a sus hijos para que vayan a la escuela.

Elena and her husband have worked in agriculture for 20 years, planting the native products of their area like potatoes and oca.  They also raise animals.  She works hard, so that after several months she can obtain the fruits of her labor.  Therefore, she gets up very early to prepare the food and to get her children ready for school.  Everyday she feeds her animals and then goes to her plots of land, that are far away, where she looks over her plants to see how they are doing.  She then returns to the stable to check on her animals.  After several months of this busy routine, Elena and her husband sell what they have harvested and the animals they have fattened.  They use what they earn to maintain their family.  \r\n\r\nFor many years this work has been the only source of income for the family.  And for Elena, this work will continue to be the main source of income for the family.  This is her twelfth loan with MFP.  She is one of the oldest members of her communal bank and is happy to have been with them for so long being seen as responsible and easy to work with.

She hails from the coastal town of Cardona, Rizal Province in the Philippines. She is mother to three children and lives happily with her husband, Romeo, who is a 35-year-old fisherman.\r\n\r\nShe believes that one should use her God-given talent to get out of poverty. In 2007, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, hoping to have access to capital for her sewing business. She sews fishing nets for fisherman to buy.\r\n\r\nNow on her 4th loan, she proposes a loan of 20,000 pesos as rolling capital for her sewing business. The loan will be used to buy two bundles of fishnets, big spools of thread, and bamboo that she will use to prepare fishing gear. Since fishing is one of the most common sources of income in their town, she hopes that her business will catch the eyes of fishermen. She also dreams of having her own house, sending her children to school, and later, having her own fish pond for much bigger income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":361494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

Letecia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional dried fish to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Letecia from GDMPC.

of Peace) communal bank which came together in the city of Cuenca.  Cuenca is the capital of the Azuay province and is renowned for its beautiful architecture, its beautiful temples, the four rivers that bathe the city, and the able hands of its craftspeople as well as for its warm and kindhearted inhabitants.  Patricia lives in the Totoracocha community, is married and has three children, 22, 20, and 18 years of age.  Her first two are students at the Instituto Sudamericano and her youngest daughter studies at the Ricardo M\u00e1rquez Tapia Institute.  Her husband is a mechanic and together they watch after the wellbeing of their home.  She still does not have a home of her own; she lives with her in-laws.  Patricia prepares meals that she home delivers.  Besides, she owns a small grocery store in her mother's house in the community of Lim\u00f3n, which is in the eastern part of Ecuador.  She travels there on weekends to see how the store is doing and to stock it with merchandise.  She has done this for 7 years.  She tells us that five years ago she was a member of the bank but had to leave for personal reasons.  However, now she is back and very happy because soon she will receive the requested loan with which she will buy kitchen equipment and pots that she needs to set up her restaurant.<br

She buys fresh fish from fishermen, then dries the fish and sells it. She has been running this business for 32 years and hopes to own a bigger business in the near future.  Martha started selling with a small amount of money from her late husband.  She has been facing problems recently with the high prices of goods and too many vendors with the same business in the New Matadi Peace Market.\r\n\r\nShe talks to her customers in a friendly manner in order to encourage them to continue buying from her.

He lives in his own house with his wife, Elena, who is 38 years old, and their 3 young children, for whom he desires to provide a better quality of life.  He owns a lot of land and has become one of the main producers in his area (cultivating bananas, ginger, and coffee).  He transports his products to the city of Pichanaki to sell them to pre-arranged buyers since his produce is of very high quality.  His favorite part of his job is harvesting his crops and he works very hard at it.  He has been doing this activity for 10 years and believes that the hardest part is protecting his fields from the plagues that can harm crops.  In the future he desires to buy more land and expand his fields.  This is his third loan with MFP and he is prepared to make punctual payments.  He has already started saving his money for this purpose.  His community bank group considers him a very happy man who is always up to date with the news of those who attend their meetings.  With the 2,500 nuevos soles he is requesting, he will purchase more fertilizer for his crops.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":564897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-08T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walter ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2543.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195414}],"funded_date":"2010-07-10T01:37:24Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":217078,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn V. is from the city of Rizal Santiago.

one permanent employee and four casual laborers. Her mixed farm produces milk, which she sells through Kenya Cooperative Creameries, and coffee, which she sells through the Coffee Board of Kenya. She also earns income from her posho mill and through the sale of bananas to the local market.<p>\r\n\r\nJoyce has requested this loan of 63,600KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. She says this loan will help increase her income and enable her to educate her son to the university level.  She currently has two dairy cows producing six liters of milk daily but hopes her milk output will increase to over 30 liters daily in the near future. Joyce says the future is bright with Juhudi loans as she will be able to do farming as a business and create wealth for her family.<p>\r\n\r\nJoyce is 52 years old.

He is married to Sra. Hilda and they have six children, of whom two are already independent.  Elias works as a mason in the area where he lives, but he also receives contracts from other provinces within the department as well as from the city.\r\n<p>\r\nElias lived in the city of Santa Cruz five years ago before returning to Cochabamba because of a problem with his sister-in-law.  Through the fault of this person, Elias lost his house and all of his belongings were auctioned off by the bank.  He and his family picked themselves up and moved in a new direction so that they could start over.  Elias and his wife now have a cottage and land for growing corn, which is harvested every six months and provides an additional source of income.  While Elias is working as a mason on different construction jobs, his wife works at a plant nursery caring for flowers that are grown in the area for specific times of the year.  They also grow potatoes and corn to help support their family.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan Elias is requesting will be used to purchase water so that he can irrigate his crops of potatoes and corn throughout the year.  This will help him earn more income so that his children can finish their high school studies.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Elias dreams of seeing his children finish high school since he was not able to earn a degree.  He wants them to pursue a degree so that they can help people in the area."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":635023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Acquire

The business is lucrative since bananas are a staple food, especially in western Uganda. Leopold combines this business with coffee sales and it is actually the profits from the coffee sales that enabled him to start his current business, which he finds more worthwhile due to the large number of people who purchase bananas weekly and especially on market days.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Don Julio C\u00e9sar has been working since he was 16 and never had an opportunity to study because of lack of funding.<p> He is presently living in the city of Juliaca and is offering urban transportation. Originally he drove a small tricycle which he conditioned and improved to transport comfortably 3 individuals, nevertheless the income was  insufficient to cover his personal expenses. After having worked very hard for some time, Julio C\u00e9sar had saved enough money to buy a motorized vehicle which he also uses for transportation service.

The \"People Committee\" of her village (UBND x\u00e3 ) had implemented a program to encourage farming. They would exchange farm land for  unexploited one. Ms T\u00e2m and her husband decided to make an exchange for an acre of land for fish farming. She was one of the first to exploit farming. She had some successes and some failures but she did not get discouraged. She was determined to reach her goal. With dedication and determination, she had been able to turn her farming business into a profitable one. Today she owns 1 acre for fish farming, a paddle of 200 egg laying ducks, 150 chicks. She had also invested in pig raising, she has 3 sows and 3  herds of piglets. The production from her family's farm is quite impressive (2 tons of pork, 1 ton of fish, 200 egg laying ducks). On average, her family makes about 450 USD\/ month.

She has been married for 18 years, and is mother to 4 children who currently live with her.  She works cultivating fruit with her husband, but art and creativity are what she has in abundance.  For this reason, what she enjoys most is making native \"cushmas\", a type of outfit made from a single piece of cloth.  She complements this item of clothing with necklaces and bracelets made from native seeds, which, in festival periods, can be sold for 20 to 30 soles per day. She rents the outfits she makes to high schools and elementary schools for 8 soles each, though occasionally she can negotiate up to 25 soles for each one.  Nercy likes making all types of clothing and dresses, but she does not neglect her agricultural work.  Every 15 days she harvests bananas and sells them from her own subsistence farm.\r\n\r\nNercy is the treasurer of her communal bank, in charge of collecting monthly payments from the members, under the supervision of the credit advisor.  This is her second loan through MFP, and she has been punctual in her payments.  The money that she is requesting is to purchase fertilizer for her banana farm to maintain its good production, and to purchase seeds and fabrics to make necklaces and outfits. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":272004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of materials for her work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-17T22:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423762},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117072},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011985},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595570},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989832},{"amount":29.76,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:36Z","rounded_local_amount":96.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210968}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T00:02:42Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":93334,"name":"Khaled","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khaled is a 49-year-old man who lives in Saida, southern Lebanon, with his wife and their four children.

She lives with her husband who transports passengers.  \r\n\r\nFor 4 years she has been selling chilled products like ice, popsicles, jell-o, soft drinks, etc. in the space she had built in her house.  Carmen also travels the streets of her city selling her products.  \r\n\r\nShe works hard for the well being of her children, and that is what motivates her to work every day.  The work has been profitable because her products sell easily.  She receives daily earnings, which makes her feel satisfied.  Most of her customers are children.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Carmen would like to have a grocery store in her house to sell her products and other foods.  She has had 9 loans with MFP.

Her previous loan was used as capital for her secondary business in the resale of toys for kids. But just recently, she opted to change her business to fish selling. She is positive that her business will grow and will bring her enough proceeds to live on.\r\n\r\nNow on her second loan, she proposes an amount of 10,000 pesos as starting capital for her proposed business of fish selling. The loan will be used to pay for 120 kilos of assorted fish. She is looking forward to having a space in the market someday and also to renovating her house into more spacious and more durable one.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":361540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish
