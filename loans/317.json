Marina\u00b4s husband hires himself out to other farmers in the region as a paid laborer. This work helps to complement the money earned from the sale of the family's own produce. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Habanero chili peppers.  Specifically, Marina will use this money to purchase seeds, fertilizer, tools, pesticides, and other materials\/ingredients necessary for the production of chili peppers. All labor and transportation tasks will be carried out by Marina and her family. \r\n\r\nIn the mornings, Marina carries out domestic tasks such as housework and tending to the children. In the afternoons, Marina joins her husband to work their own plot of land. Marina\u00b4s goal is to increase the yield of her farm. She hopes to earn enough revenue from the production of chili peppers to keep her children in school. She hopes to improve her economic situation and offer a better standard of living to her family. A major difficulty and limitation for Marina has been her lack of working capital combined with previously unsuccessful harvesting seasons. She hopes to use this loan effectively to improve life on the farm for everyone.\r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or, PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products.

By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Marina wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. She wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in her neighborhood. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":573491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase seeds and nutrients to produce chili peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Los Chiles","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-07-23T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Marina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95914.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97513.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99138.68},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100790.98},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102470.84},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104171.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.97},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.39},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.45,"local_amount":31890.39,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":32163.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148770},{"amount":57.01,"local_amount":29111.52,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":29360.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289966},{"amount":62.45,"local_amount":31890.39,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":32163.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211231339},{"amount":130.12,"local_amount":66443.1,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:10Z","rounded_local_amount":67011.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222221628},{"amount":213.64,"local_amount":109092.3,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":110025.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244569982},{"amount":649.33,"local_amount":331572.3,"processed_date":"2012-02-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-01T09:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":334409.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259110065}],"funded_date":"2010-07-24T00:53:01Z","paid_date":"2012-03-01T09:07:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":221578,"name":"Katungamo Women's Voice Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"It has now been 22 years since Vincent K. started up his farming business adventure in Ntungamo.

As she has achieved a stable market, she has also managed to start selling a variety of goods.  She is a widow who lives in the Santa Elena de Barranquilla neighborhood and has 3 children aged from 29 to 33 years old.  She began her business career with a dressmaking business after her husband died and she found herself alone and in charge of supporting her family, something which she didn't do before.  She arrived at the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo with this initial business as part of a communal bank made up of four members.  Gradually her growth became so great that she decided to go it alone, setting up a communications business which is the one she currently has since it is one of the talents for which she is well known.  She currently has 6 computer systems and printer. She has already had 20 loans from this organization which have enabled her to provide an education for her children and improve her family's quality of life.  The improvements to her home and Gladys' self-sufficiency are well known as is her good repayment history which makes her worthy of the trust of the many institutions which approach her.\r\n\r\nGladys is currently requesting a Kiva loan to update her equipment and get ready for the student holiday period which is fast approaching. Her equipment needs to be working at full speed. Her dream is to adapt her house by building a second level in order to completely separate her business; to own a general store where she can sell her merchandise and, further in the future, she hopes to buy her own car so that she can go out for a drive with her family which is what they deserve after many years of effort.

People are compelled to try in as many spheres as possible in order to make a living.  The rural areas are the most vulnerable to any changes in the nation. With no production and substantially low employment, rural areas are left without a labor force and became even more undeveloped, while the urban population grows.  \r\n\r\nNazira K., 35, is a treasurer of this group of borrowers. A resident of the small coal-mining town of Tashkomur in Southern Kyrgyzstan, she has been involved in livestock breeding for two years. She is a mother of four children and her husband is a coal miner. He sells coal to local consumers and to other regions of the city. \r\n\r\nNazira says the biggest challenge for her is to pay enough attention to livestock breeding while raising four kids. Livestock needs careful treatment the whole day, starting from early in the morning until late in the evening. When the livestock is grown, Nazira sells it and buys new younger ones to raise.  This business always has enjoyed high demand because the Kyrgyz people\u2019s main dish is meat. \r\n\r\nThe business was Nazira\u2019s husband\u2019s initiative, thanks to which the family\u2019s monthly revenue is 10000 soms. This loan is planned for the purchase of  9-10 livestock animals. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

With a lot of hard work he was able to provide his family with their own home. From a young age he was an expert in feeding cattle, sheep and pigs, an ability he that was passed down from his father. But when he formed his own family he had to move to his wife's place, and since then he has learned the art of cultivating and working on the land he inherited from his in-laws. At first, he planted coffee along with the in-laws' citrus trees. Now he has gone off on his own, but he has not stopped supporting all the work of his wife's parents. <p>\r\nHildo is very happy at home and at work. Every time he harvests coffee he sells it to a coffee house that pays him 4.80 soles for every kilo. His earnings are safe and dependable, and don't fluctuate like the prices he could offer at the market. For the citrus products, he has buyers who go to the same sales point as the coffee, and although they pay him a lower price, it is convenient and saves time.

Her husband is living abroad. He went abroad in order to provide their children a better future, but the world economic crisis has prevented him from sending back much money. The home in which they live is the fruit of the couple's hard work and sacrifices, and Digna says that loans from the foundation have enabled her to repay some of her husband's debts.\r\n<p>\r\nDigna has a business selling fruit and vegetables. She also has a grocery store in her home which her sons help her run when she is not there. She is grateful to God for every day, be it good or bad.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has worked with her Community Bank for seven years and attends meetings every two weeks for training and to enjoy some leisure time with her friends in the group. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, Digna will invest in her business by purchasing fruit and vegetables to sell.

Blender","image":123338}},{"id":155368,"name":"Juana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Juana is 42 years old. She lives with her husband and 2 daughters in Corredores, a rural region of Southern Costa Rica. Juana has a business selling hand-made clothing, necklaces and bracelets from her home. She demonstrates a strong work ethic; assembling jewellery, making and selling clothes by day, while working evenings and nights in a local restaurant as a waitress.\n\nSimilar to the story of many low income individuals in Costa Rica, and across the world, Juana has found it impossible to obtain approval for a business loan from the local bank in Corredores. The bank requires a guarantor of a loan to be someone who is not part of her immediate family. Juana does not know any suitable guarantors, with a steady income and a secure job, other than her husband. From Juana\u00b4s perspective, the rules of the formal banking system have had the effect of excluding her from the financial services she seeks.\n\n In an effort to extend the reach of financial services to deserving entrepreneurs, Fundacion Mujer proposes to lend Juana 500,000 colons (around $862 US), with her husband as the loan guarantor. This will be her second loan with Fundacion Mujer. Juana received her first loan in 2008 for 100,000 colons ($173 US) which was repaid from her business earnings, on time and in full, within 6 months.\n\nWith this loan, Juana plans to purchase raw materials such as cloth and necklace parts in an effort to expand her jewellery and clothes-selling business. Recently, many of Juana\u2019s regular clients have inquired about the possibility of purchasing shoes. She would like to satisfy this demand and expand her business by providing quality footwear to her clients. She will use this loan to buy shoes from a contact in Panama to sell from her home in Costa Rica. Juana dreams of expanding her business and earning more money so she can provide a better standard of living for her family. She says that since starting her business 2 years ago, her self-confidence has increased. Juana is now a strong believer in her ability to improve living conditions for her family through her determination and hard work. \n\nYour contribution is a direct investment in the betterment of the lives of families living in a poor community of southern Costa Rica. By lending to Juana, a hard-working entrepreneur, you are enabling her to build towards a higher standard of living. On behalf of Juana and her family, we thank you for your

She makes her home here in a simple structure made of wood, concrete and a tin roof as a single mother with her one adult child.<P>\r\n\r\nIsabel is excited to be taking her fourth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans, and she looks forward to continuing to grow with Esperanza. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business taking orders from her clients to purchase bed sheets, bedspreads, women's blouses and women's underwear in Santiago (the closest large city) and selling them at a profit. She will use the profits to continue improving her house to the point where there are no more wooden walls (which are susceptible to termites) with the long term goal of adding a small corner store to her home so that she can work from home. <P>\r\n\r\nAdditionally, she would like to see her son become a professional and she is using part of the profits from her loan to fund his university education, studying accounting. He is the first person in her family to attend university. She thanks you all for your support and would like to urge more people to join Esperanza so that they can improve their lives like she has.

However, not one book, no matter how big it could be and not a movie, no matter how many episodes it could contain, can show all of the nuances of people\u2019s daily lives.  These creations can only show single moments and offer an overall understanding about the lives of our heroes.  The heroes of our story deserve to be heroes of these books or movies because they labor every day for their families and try to provide them with good lives.\r\n\r\nKerimbubu I. is the leader of this group.  Some time ago, she lost her husband.  However, this did not break her and, on the contrary, gave her additional strength because she is a mother of four children.  Now, all of the four children are married and live separately.  Kerimbubu preferred not to be dependent on her children and is currently involved in growing agricultural crops.  She grows wheat and potatoes on her land plot.  In the autumn, she sells the harvest and receives her yearly income.  Kerimbubu has been involved in farming for four years and gained quite a bit of experience.  Originally, she started with five thousand som and now earns up to thirty thousand som per year.  Currently, Kerimbubu needs a loan in order to buy diesel fuel for field work.\r\n\r\nKerimbubu\u2019s group partners are:\r\n\r\nAnarkan Ibaeva is fifty-seven years old.  She and her husband raised seven children.  Her husband is currently retired, but he, Anarkan and their children are involved in growing agricultural products.  Their yearly income is about fifty thousand som.  Anarkan requested this loan in order to buy fuel and wheat seeds.\r\n\r\nGulnara C. is forty-five years old.  Her husband is a tractor driver.  Gulnara is a mother of five daughters.  Currently, Gulnara and her husband are preparing the field for sowing.  They will be planting wheat.  Their last autumn harvest was six thousand ton of wheat.

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\r\nJudith is married and has five children. She is 37 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, and an experienced farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the prayer group and the burial committee.  Judith has been a farmer for 16 years.  She described her harvest as excellent last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\r\n\r\nJudith joined One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Judith joined One Acre Fund so that she could get new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  Because she wants to help more farmers, Judith has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Judith's life because she has more farm training and was able to save money.  In the future, Judith hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school and save for the future.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Judith and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.

village in Kampong Chhnang province. She sells firewood. Her husband, Mr. Lum Thol, is a farmer who owns a plot of land where he cultivates rice. Even though they work hard, they still earn less income than they need to provide a better life for their family. In order to improve their living conditions, Mrs. Tren C. decided to ask for a loan to add to her savings to build a new house. She is 35 years old and the mother of three children, two of whom attend the local school and the third is still too young to go school. One member of the group, Vy S., was not available for the photo, so her husband is in the photo.\r\n\r\nOne member of this group has an end-of-term loan and the rest have monthly payment loans. The end-of-term loan client is not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor.

M. is 38 years old and lives with his wife Virginia and his two sons, Kevin and Kener. They live in a small, rural community in Costa Rica called Las Delicias de Upala, in the Alajuela province. People in his community own shops, plant basic grains (including rice, beans, and corn), and raise cattle (for both meat and milk).\r\n\r\nBecause of the limited sources of employment in the community, Salvador decided to become a small businessman. He raises cattle and sells its meat, milk, and milk products in his community as well as in the surrounding area. In his estimation, this is an excellent area of opportunity, as he can sell to intermediaries or directly to the public.\r\n\r\nSalvador's father has been in this field for a long time, and this has helped Salvador experience all the different aspects of the job. Over the years, his father has taught him a lot about this business.\r\n\r\nSalvador is requesting a microloan for 570,000 Costa Rican colones, to be repaid in 24 months. With the loan, he will purchase three more cows in order to increase production. He knows that having more cows will require more care and attention. However, his desire to be a successful small businessman, to get ahead and to improve his family's living conditions, motivates him to work hard and with great care.\r\n\r\nSalvador is a member of the \u201cEmpresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Datraban\u201d (Datraban Community Credit Company), one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his second loan, and he hopes to continue growing both personally and economically.

The group uses only locally available materials  such as sheep and camel wool to make their products. Tserendugjir started her business in 2006 and has since found much success. She has taught all of her children how to make slippers and they help her during their school vacations. Tserendugjir is a very open-minded and responsible businesswoman and her dream is to one day have her own souvenir shop where she and other local handicraft makers can sell their products. She is requesting a 2 million tugrug (approx. $1,380 USD) loan to purchase wool processing equipment that will enable her to increase the productivity of her business and the quality of her products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":373361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives in the locality of Santa Rosa (on the edge of the jungle), where she has her own home.  She recalls that a few years back, her spouse didn't have a job and they only had a small crop of cacao plants that in certain occasions could barely provide for her family.  Thanks to the unconditional support of her parents, they were able to overcome that difficult time.  Nowadays they cultivate and sell in large quantities to their buyers, who feel satisfied with the product that they are purchasing.  As a result, the sales produce good earnings.  In general, she receives constant help from her spouse and together they make a good team.  Sometimes she receives help from laborers to help facilitate the final production.  Normally she sells her product to the distribution centers in her area at a competitive price.  Her future plans are to acquire new land with the proposal of improving her quality of life and that of her family's.  This is her fourteenth credit with MFP.  As such, she promises to continue fulfilling her payment plan.  In addition, she is happy with her communal bank for providing good economic results.  With the credit that she is seeking, she plans to invest in the purchase of supplies and fertilizers in order to properly maintain her cacao plantations.     <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy Quan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":581934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer to be used on her cacao plantations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-11T13:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463082}],"funded_date":"2010-08-12T19:01:14Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracy Quan","image":null}},{"id":225707,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flora S. is currently in the business of selling sugar, charcoal, cooking oil, fish and rice at the market and is requesting a loan to stock more bags of rice and jerrycans of cooking oil to sell.

Starting at 6 am she is ready to receive her early morning shoppers who appreciate the variety of merchandise that she offers in her store.  They don't have any doubts about shopping at her store since they are sure that they are going to find what they need.  What she likes most about her job is talking with her customers and finding out what is going on in the village.  She has been running her store for 23 years, however, the most difficult part of her job is having to stay in the store all day without being able to leave.   She knows, however,  that sacrifice has its rewards.  In time, she would like to see her business grow and to offer her customers better service.  \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  She expects to make her payments on time since she doesn't want to cause problems for the other members in her communal bank where she is very respected because of the discipline she brings to the group.  With the five hundred nuevos soles (Peruvian currency) that she is requesting, she will buy more products to better manage her store.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ann Achilli, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":597275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more merchandise for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-08T16:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":559.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549393}],"funded_date":"2010-09-08T18:17:40Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":233902,"name":"Lutfiya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A married mother of two, Lutfiya has worked tirelessly for the past seven years to develop her lump sugar production business in Kurgantyube central market.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They are going to use their loan to buy flour, sugar, food coloring, bags, oil, ribbons, tape and cinnamon to make wafers.  Virgilio is going to buy flour, sugar, shortening and firewood to bake bread.  Carina and Ofelia are going to buy wafers by the package to repackage in smaller amounts and sell.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Guadalupe is 38 years old, married and has four children: three girls and one boy.  All her children are in school.  Her oldest daughter is in high school, the next two are in middle school and her youngest daughter is in elementary school.\r\n\r\nShe makes \u2018obleas\u2019 (sweet made from two thin wafers stuffed with caramel) and requested the loan to buy flour, food coloring, oil, sugar and bags to have everything necessary for her business.  She started the business six years ago.  Her children were small and she had economic needs so her cousin taught her how to prepare the dough for the wafers.  Her husband bought her the machines to make them and she used savings she had to buy the raw materials.  This is how the obleas business started.  \r\n\r\nShe likes to work to help her husband and to have money to live better.

She used the profit from her past loans to feed, clothe, provide medication for, and educate her children. Given a loan, she intends to invest it in poultry farming. She believes that this business will be a success because she has many years of experience farming poultry and also because there is high demand for poultry products.

Her husband is Armando, a contractor and father to her children. Delia, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nDelia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages to residents of the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a packet of shampoo, a few pesos' worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting her inventory at wholesale prices and then retailing them by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products she sells in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nDelia hopes her business will grow into a mini-grocery.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve the agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients present a viable business proposition.

Her son, who is the oldest, is eleven years old and her daughter is just four. Kyyal herself takes care of the house. She keeps two cows and sells milk. In her free time, she also sews traditional national folk art and goods. In this way, even while staying at home, Kyyal is able to not only care for the children and fulfill her duties as housewife, but also to support the family budget. Many years ago, Kyyal became interested in breeding livestock. She has decided to take action and to try it. She wasn\u2019t afraid to invest 18,000 <em>soms<\/em> (420 USD) of her own money toward the purchase of cows. Meanwhile, she and her husband were able to save up enough money for the purchase of a home. From the sale of milk and her folk creations, Kyyal currently earns 3,500 <em>soms<\/em> (82 USD) per month. That equals to her average monthly income. Now Kyaal would like to receive a loan to buy two calves for further breeding and for sale on the market. Kyaal would also like to build a large house on the income from her milk and folk goods sales, since construction requires the investment of a large sum of money all at once.\r\n<p>\r\nHere are Kyaal\u2019s partners in the group: Miralan, Elmira, and Gulzat.\r\n<p>\r\nMiralan is twenty-two. He is already married and has a daughter. Miralan resells cattle on the livestock market. His wife stays at home, as their daughter is just one and a half years old. Miralan is a very capable businessman and provides sufficiently for his family. He hopes to receive a loan and to invest it towards his working capital. Miralan\u2019s lifelong dream is to save up enough money to buy a private apartment.\r\n<p>\r\nElmira is thirty-one years old. She is the mother of two children. Her youngest daughter is just three years old. Elmira works as a saleslady in the \u201cNational\u201d shopping center. Her husband is a metalworker in the town of Tokmok. Thanks to a joint effort, Elmira and her husband were able to do a good job renovating their home. Elmira decided to apply for a loan in order to obtain a large cow. After reselling the cow, Elmira plans to buy a car.\r\n<p>\r\nGulzat is thirty-three yars old. She is married and has two children. Gulzat works as a salesperson and consultant. Her husband is the founder of the firm \u201cAsia Build.\u201d Gulzat hopes to receive a loan and put it towards the trade of consumer goods. With the profits, Gulzat wants to buy herself a car.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anastasia Uglova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":423790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of livestock in order to finance various goals, such as building a home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tokmak","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2009-11-20T17:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kyyal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miralan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gulzat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":14107},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":14587},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":15319},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15987}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":323.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.28},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":351.06},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":323.29,"local_amount":14107,"processed_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":14134.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103838991},{"amount":334.28,"local_amount":14587,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:17:15Z","rounded_local_amount":14614.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110730779},{"amount":351.06,"local_amount":15319,"processed_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":15348.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118121326},{"amount":366.37,"local_amount":15987,"processed_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":16017.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989786}],"funded_date":"2009-11-21T11:46:43Z","paid_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anastasia Uglova","image":976652}},{"id":155400,"name":"Dolores","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dolores tiene 30 a\u00f1os, vive muy contenta en su casa propia al lado de su hija, Sheyna, de 12 a\u00f1os de edad.\nSu negocio es la venta y de gas, ella adquiere los balones de una distribuidora de gas y posteriormente los vende individualmente a sus vecinos y dem\u00e1s clientes que se acercan a su negocio en busca de este combustible.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives at his parents\u2019 house with his wife Maday, age 25, and their only child Jhon who is 3 years old.  Wilfredo wants to provide them with a better quality of life.  From a young age he learned how to work on a farm.  His parents taught him everything he needed to know about achieving a good crop.  Now he has his own land that he cultivates and cares for with much love and patience.  Wilfredo grows coffee and bananas, products that are eventually sold at the market in the city of La Merced.  He has been farming for 10 years and says he enjoys the harvesting season, but he must constantly take care of his fields to protect them from plagues of insects that can impact his production.  His greatest wish is to buy a vehicle so that he can transport his goods to market.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP.

The official name of this borrowing group is \"Prescila E.'s Group\".\r\n\r\nPrescilla is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Prescilla owns & operates a general store.

Prescilla has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Prescilla joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Prescilla has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Prescilla is requesting a new loan of 16,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Prescilla from ASKI.

Mrs. Channa P. is the 40-year-old village bank president. She owns a small business selling juice. Her husband, Mr. Mang Polo, is a farmer who owns a plot of land where he cultivates rice. In this plantation, he needs the money to buy fertilizer and gasoline to pump water to support the field. Thus, Mrs. Channa P. decided to ask for a loan for this purpose. She has four children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory while another is attending the local school and the youngest one is too young to work or study. (Mrs. Sorn MA. did not come to take the loan but her husband did, so he is in the picture instead her.) \r\n\r\nAll the members in this group loan have end-of-term loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan's term.

Most of the income goes to transportation, school expenses, and projects for the schools of her children.<P>\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of Php 15,000 as additional capital for her frozen foods sales was fully repaid on time, without any delay.  She recently borrowed Php 13,000 for the needs of her business. Income from it will be used to help with the children's education.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:<P>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges,  Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in  the lives of thousands of women through Project  'Dungganon'; (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is  empowering these women to progress out of earning less than US$ 1 a day to  achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a  life path that will ultimately make them 'Dungganon' -  a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has  earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":435578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a variety store and a carenderia (mini-restaurant). She has two children who are 26 and 20 years old. Gaudencia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1991 because she wanted something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gaudencia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $207, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future household expenses and for her family\u2019s future. Gaudencia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Several years ago, Luis requested a loan to insulate the inside of his first van, which proved advantageous for his business by keeping his goods cold and preventing any damage. He has requested a loan to insulate his second van, which will be necessary to keep his goods fresh during the hot New York City summer.\r\n\r\nLuis begins his morning with his first delivery route between one and two in the morning. He does three rounds of deliveries throughout the day. In the morning, he\u2019s bringing fresh baked goods to cafes, delis, and coffee shops.

She says that putting up a business was not easy \u2013 especially when they had virtually no money to start it \u2013 but she had an intense desire to have her own business and help her husband support their young family. Mildred joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 so that she could have access to start-up capital, even if it was just a small amount. \r\n<p>\r\nWith the help and support of NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mildred started a <i>sari-sari<\/i> (general store) where she sells a variety of household commodities. She has slowly expanded her product offerings with subsequent loans, by re-investing some of her profits back into her business. Now, in the addition to the usual stuff sold in <i>sari-sari<\/i> stores, Mildred also sells frozen food, Ready-to-Wear dresses and offers an electronic loading service for pre-paid mobile phones to her neighbors. This earns her an average income of PHP 18,000 per month.\r\n<p>\r\nMildred plans to use her tenth loan cycle of  20,000 PHP to expand the product offerings in her <i>sari-sari<\/i> even further, so that with the profits, she can finally make some improvements to her home.   \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of  \u2013 not just of a few \u2013 but thousands of women.

Two of them go to school and the two youngest are babies. He has owned a plot of land for ten years, where he lives with his family and grows bananas, citrus fruits, cassava and rice, but also trees for timber production (cedar, mahogany, screw beans and other varieties) which he sells to sawmills. Hiroito likes his work because it is his own business, he works for hours without stress, and it is very profitable. Indeed, most of the wood he sells is produced on his farm and the profit enables him to provide for his family.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.

He has reached several goals in the two short years he has been associated with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. \r\n\r\nWhen he joined in 2007 he went from being an independent merchant to establishing his phone call service.  Despite starting out with a borrowed cell phone and not being very successful at selling service minutes near the university, he kept trying in other parts of town and he set himself up for business in his home.\r\n\r\nHe used his two prior loans to buy computers that today make up the core of his Internet caf\u00e9 business.  In addition to his four computer Internet service, he has four phone lines available and also sells soft-drinks, candy and snacks.\r\n\r\nHe is currently asking for a $2.300.000 loan to buy a photocopying machine and another computer which will allow him to provide better service.\r\n\r\nHe feels that he has grown a lot in the two years that he\u2019s had his business; that the training opportunities have helped him quite a bit and he has become better organized in his business thus producing higher income for his family.\r\n\r\nDespite his success, however, he sometimes feels that he doesn\u2019t have the necessary resources to have more equipment and enlarge his business as he\u2019d like to in order to meet increased customer demand.\r\n\r\nIn addition to facing this challenge, his goal is to enlarge his business to have everything related to stationery.  He also dreams with owning his own house because he and his family currently live in an uncle\u2019s house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

Mrs. Safiatou D. sells her wares for cash or credit to a customer base made up mostly of women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans to buy 35 bags of cassava in and around Sikasso and 60 bags of cassava mash (Ti\u00e8k\u00e8doro) in Bouak\u00e9 (the Republic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire) in order to blend them and create a good quality Atti\u00e8k\u00e8.\r\n\r\nShe anticipates making a monthly profit of 230,000 CFA francs with this loan, which will mainly be used to grow her business, contribute to the family expenses and pay the interest on her loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Jessalyn Pinneo, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":541199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buying cassava mash and tubers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50115.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961567},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50115.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699686},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:06Z","rounded_local_amount":50115.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913577},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50115.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180735},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":50115.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476706},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50115.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613410},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":50115.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751879},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":50115.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606121}],"funded_date":"2010-06-04T15:51:49Z","paid_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessalyn Pinneo","image":603028}},{"id":205272,"name":"Tessie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tessie A. is a 43 year old widow who supports her family by engaging in raising ducks for sale and selling eggs.

Caradio-an, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: pig fattening and fishing businesses. Her husband, Jim, who is 60 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living , and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between 30 and 36 years old. \r\n\r\nEva joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000, because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eva has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 29,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,500 PHP, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for her livestock business and for maintenance on her husband's fishing boat so that her family can continue to save up for future home repairs. \r\n\r\nEva P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He lives in a home that he owns together with his wife Nancy, 36 years old, and their 7 beloved children. He wishes to provide them with a better quality of life.  Felix's business is the harvest of potatoes, fava beans and peas. Every morning he sets out for his fields and works to make them more fertile and more productive. He brings the harvest to the wholesalers' market in Tarma. There, he is able to acquire very good prices for his products, given their excellent quality. What he most enjoys about his work warding off plagues that may decimate production. He has had 5 years in the field and in time he hopes to purchase or rent more land to increase production. This is his sixth loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and he is committed to making his payments on time, not wanting to cause any trouble for his community bank. He is a very responsible and punctual member of the bank. The three thousand nuevos soles he requests will be used to purchase more fertilizer for his plantations.
