She is 40 years old. Lourdes is married and has five school-age children. To make a living, Lourdes owns and operates a manufacturing business. The main source of income for the business comes from manufacturing and selling generally manufactured products to local businesses and community members. Lourdes has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Lourdes joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lourdes has successfully repaid a previous loan of 40,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. Lourdes is requesting a new loan of 40,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 17th loan taken out by Lourdes from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b><br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Her husband works in technical maintenance of the hydroelectric station \u201cKambar Ata.\u201d \r\n\r\nFor 21 years this couple has raised various types of cattle. The foundation was laid 21 years ago when Mairamkul\u2019s husband spent his salary of 15,000 KGS on purchasing six head of cattle. \r\n\r\nSince then, for Mairamkul, cattle breeding has been the major activity, just like for anyone else in the neighborhood. At this moment, their monthly profit equals 5,000 KGS, most of which is spent on covering transportation and food costs. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of Mairamkul\u2019s loan is to buy more cattle for further breeding and reselling. Her future dreams are purchasing an automobile and land and boosting the number of cattle.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She lives in her own house with her husband Francisco, 32, and her son Ubaldo, 6 years old. She works without rest to reach the goals that she has drawn up. In her small house made of adobe, she has worked for 2 years without rest, weaving small and amusing dolls made from wool. She takes these dolls to sell in the city of Puno, where there are tourists that become excited about her dolls and buy them rapidly. Dionisia really enjoys making these amusing dolls, which fills her with satisfaction, and she now knows that through these means she can provide food for her family. She hopes in time to create a more stable business which will give her economic earnings, and she knows she has to provide good studies for her dear son, who responds to her sacrifices with a lot of love and always accompanies her everywhere she goes. Dionisia has requested 4 loans through MFP, and she has been very punctual with her repayments. She has never had problems with her communal bank, where she charged with providing the happiness quota that keeps the rest of her members very happy. Dionisia wishes to increase her working capital, and will invest all of it in buying more wool, to increase the amount of little dolls that she weaves. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":272803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buy wool for her weavings ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T00:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dionisia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":107.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117089},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":107.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012002},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":107.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595587},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":107.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989849},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":107.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210985},{"amount":33.35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":107.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640486}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T03:03:18Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":93430,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence B. is 36 years old and a married woman with four children.

All three of his children are in school. Nassor owns a charcoal business that he opened earlier this year. The business operates from 7 am until 8 pm every day. Currently, his business makes a profit of about US$ 20 a day, which he uses to pay school fees for his children.\r\n\r\nThis will be Nassor's first loan from Tujijenge. With the money, he will buy more charcoal to increase his stocks. He will sell this charcoal from his home to both retail and wholesale customers.\r\n\r\nNassor will share this loan with the members of his group, Mawimbi, which means \"clouds\" in Kiswahili. Most of the sixteen group members are food vendors; one is a fisherman, one sells juice, and another sells soap. They will hold each other accountable for paying back their loans, and meet once a week to make repayments, discuss their businesses, and share advice. In the picture, Nassor is second from the left (crouching down)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":412344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

His station is also strategically located in front of the city\u2019s central market.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan he is requesting will be used for repairs to his station wagon.  Remberto and his family have taken out four loans with the Institution.  He has demonstrated an excellent payment history and has only requested loans from our Institution.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Though it was easy for her to do that, she also wants to provide her children with nice clothing and other things.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (variety) store and pig fattening. Her husband Ignacio G., who is 62 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are between 25 and 38 years old; all of her children have their own family now. \r\n\r\nRosita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1990 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion. Rosita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have six children who are between 9 and 28 years old. Four of their children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores. Their other two children are employed.\r\n\r\nJocelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in a general store and food vending business. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nJocelyn is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 was used to fund operations of her general store, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 10th loan, the amount of PHP 12,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital. Jocelyn is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She tends to raise turkeys for subsequent sale.  She has a group of these barnyard fowl that she raises in her back yard.  When they reach a good level of development she sells them to merchants that visit the area where she lives.  She currently has a small piece of farmland where she grows mango and lemon.  The lemons are harvested weekly and sold to the processing plants that process the fruit for commercialization.\r\n\r\nIncome from these activities allows her to help her husband meet family expenses.  Josefa tries to give her best effort to stay in business and help her loved ones get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe wants to improve her animal-raising by making some improvements to their enclosures and buying nutritionally balanced feed for them.

For 6 years, this enterprising woman has sold food, pop and candy near a bus stop on the highway north of her city. She starts work with the first rays of morning light, and at 9 in the morning she waits for her customers who are anxious to enjoy her dishes. Her food is not only highly sought after for its good flavour, but also for the good prices that she offers. She says that she likes this work a lot, and she counts on the support of her sister and her oldest child so that they can tend to the customers without problems. Later, at noon, she runs out of her dishes, and she works on collecting her money because some of her customers pay her weekly or daily, depending on their deal. Since she is an enterprising woman, in the future she plans to open a restaurant in a market in her area. She wants to have a stable job. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and she promises to pay her quotas punctually since she does not want to look bad in front of the people who are making this loan possible.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fishing and a fish-vending business. Her husband, Milo S., who is 39 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are 5 to 17 years old. \r\n\r\nMary Jean joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mary Jean has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP helped her increase her monthly profit to about $355, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing 19,000 PHP, which she intends to use to do maintenance work on her fishing boat so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Mary Jean S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has two dependent children. She started her business six years ago selling snacks for children. Little by little she reinvested her profits in her business and started buying basic grains, which are the highest selling products.

is a member of the Roma minority in Sliven, Bulgaria.  <p>\r\n\r\nDiana is a traveling sock saleswoman.  She purchases inventory from five large producers based in Sliven and spends four days per week traveling to several regional, open-air markets.  Her \u201csales territory\u201d extends east to the Black Sea, south to the Turkish border, and west to Stara Zagora, in the center of Bulgaria.  Diana charters a minivan with five other Sliven-based traveling merchants, who sell shoes, tracksuits and other apparel. <p>\r\n\r\nThe unit economics of Diana\u2019s business are fairly straightforward.  She purchases socks for the local equivalent of $0.20-$0.30 and sells them at 2x \u2013 3x their cost.  Diana sells between 300 and 400 of pairs per month, with a gross profit of approximately $200.  After paying out her share of the minivan, she nets around $150. <p>\r\n\r\nDiana has requested this loan for two reasons.  First, she is looking to expand the breadth of her inventory.  Right now, she only has money to carry some of the more basic sock styles, and believes she could sell more if she had a broader inventory.  Second, Diana wants to purchase an overhead sign for her booth in order to attract more attention and develop a brand, as well as provide cover for her products when it rains.  Currently, she covers her socks with plastic during inclement weather, but realizes that potential clients purchase more when they can easily browse merchandise; a plastic covering prevents that. <p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":24117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BG","country":"Bulgaria","town":"Sliven","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42.685833 26.329167","type":"point"}},"partner_id":3,"posted_date":"2007-04-02T21:58:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-17T19:42:38Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T11:58:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23306},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T12:00:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23322},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T12:00:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23335},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T12:03:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23339},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T12:03:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23342},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T12:03:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23344},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-07-30T12:33:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":37115},{"amount":333,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2007-08-03T11:46:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":333,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":38635},{"amount":534,"local_amount":534,"processed_date":"2008-07-28T07:24:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":534,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":279260}],"funded_date":"2007-04-03T19:42:38Z","paid_date":"2008-07-28T07:24:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11518,"name":"Soy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Soy T.

He wants to buy one more that is updated.  This is so that it will be more attractive to approach his business.  Seven months ago he had problems with electricity.  Because of this, two machines burned out.  \r\n\r\nThat is why he is asking for the loan to buy new machines and repair the ones that were damaged.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to expand the business more in order to have greater economic stability for him and his family\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":423203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-11-09T19:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jony Alexis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.21,"local_amount":1104.12,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1142.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790898},{"amount":49.11,"local_amount":982.23,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1016.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075938},{"amount":45.68,"local_amount":913.65,"processed_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":945.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911945},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1034.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130493310},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1034.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136676063},{"amount":104.74,"local_amount":2094.83,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2166.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710433},{"amount":49.98,"local_amount":999.51,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152045742},{"amount":49.89,"local_amount":997.71,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166847983},{"amount":45.39,"local_amount":907.95,"processed_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":939.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172255977}],"funded_date":"2009-11-10T23:48:27Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T08:48:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":155089,"name":"Olegaria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olegaria C. is from the village of Liposong, Ozamiz City.

Later on he plans to buy fertile land in a coffee growing area in the central jungle of Per\u00fa.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan he has had with MFP.  Like the first time, he will show that he is responsible in his actions.  He affirms that he is happy to belong to such an organized communal bank.  With the amount that he is now requesting he will buy three sacks of fertilizer and two bottles of insecticide to protect the plants in his fields.  He also intends to pay the workmen he will hire.\r\n    <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":487908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizers and insecticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-14T19:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celestino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1069.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672925}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T21:13:46Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":180156,"name":"Kiyunga Development Group, Lugazi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They received their house from the government and when they got it, it was very small and basic.  Roberto has been improving the house as, in this way, he knows that if some day he were to be parted from his family, they would have a safe home in which to live.  He would now like to build a room on the lower floor of his house in order to extend his living room \/ dining room and thereby have more space.  In order to do this, he would like to buy materials such as cement, sand and metal rods, and pay a builder."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":898638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy cement and sand, and to pay labor costs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acuna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"29.3 -100.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2011-10-19T15:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5247.53,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":722.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":777.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":836.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":900.12},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":968.39},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.1},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.28},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.77},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.1,"local_amount":722.91,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":742.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244539522},{"amount":59.28,"local_amount":777.74,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-16T08:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":799.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250750173},{"amount":63.77,"local_amount":836.52,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":859.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257392161},{"amount":68.62,"local_amount":900.12,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-17T07:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":925.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263704573},{"amount":153.23,"local_amount":2010.24,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:57:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2066.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270008793}],"funded_date":"2011-10-22T19:46:56Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:57:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":352486,"name":"Josefina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josefina is 57 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Ndumi also takes care of her younger sister aged 30 years who is HIV positive and is on anti-retroviral treatment. Ndumi also takes care of another sister who is asthmatic, and therefore cannot work effectively. Ndumi is also responsible for the upkeep of her sisters\u2019 children. True to her Christian calling, Ndumi devotes some of her free time visiting people who are HIV positive and the disadvantaged people in Kitengela Township. During such visits, she takes to them foodstuff and clothes. \r\n\r\nNdumi started her tailoring business in the year 1997. This was after she finished her tailoring course, which was conducted by the Singer company. Before that, she used to sell vegetables while at the same time making mandazi (a doughnut-like bun). Her mandazi\u2019s were well sought after because they were delicious and she cooked them in a clean environment. Through the sale of mandazi and vegetables she managed to raise Ksh 32,000 (USD 490). \r\n\r\nWith this money Ndumi bought a sewing machine and various types of tailoring materials. She then rented a stall in Kitengela where she is operating today. Due to the growing number of school-going children as a result of the government\u2019s offer of free P]primary education, Ndumi is always busy trying to keep up with the high demand of school uniforms.            \r\n\r\nNdumi is therefore kindly requesting for a loan of USD 775. Given this loan in kind in the form of cloth materials for her tailoring stall, Ndumi will be able to add on to her stock of school uniforms, sweaters, ties, socks, and badges of different primary schools that have given her a two year contract to supply school uniforms. Ndumi intends to repay the loan within 8-12 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":41061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of sewing fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitengela, Athi River","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-06-07T23:13:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ndumi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-22T04:02:04Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":775,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2008-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2008-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":96.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2007-08-17T09:20:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":43788},{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2007-09-17T09:20:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":55765},{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2007-10-17T09:20:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68601},{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2007-11-17T10:21:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82732},{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2007-12-17T10:23:39Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98429},{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":117119},{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2008-02-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137107},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2008-03-17T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159877}],"funded_date":"2007-06-08T04:02:04Z","paid_date":"2008-03-17T10:07:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":7,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":15630,"name":"Sergei","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sergei earns a living by driving a taxi around the city of Ivano-Frankovsk in western Ukraine.

He generally plants citrus fruits (oranges, mandarins). The most profitable months are from January to March, because this is the summer season in the city of Lima, where he sends his products.

They are also responsible for caring of his old parents. Erali is a farmer. Recognized by the people of the neighborhood as a serious man, Erali would like to expand his crop into a viable source of income. In order to do that, he needs a loan of 3000 Somoni to buy seeds and fertilizer so as to expand his crop. The income from it will then help him to cope with the needs of his large family and educate all his children. Erali is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his dreams with this loan.  \n \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mae is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mae joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. Mae is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional goods for sale. This loan will be the second loan she has taken out from GDMPC.

At first all of his earnings went to pay for the education of his children. However, now the profits he earns are used to cover domestic necessities and to save so that in the future he can convert his business to the production of root vegetables and peas, products that are in high demand.  In addition, he will cultivate in greater quantity so that he can have a higher income, which will allow him to provide an adequate quality of life for his family.\r\n\r\nThis is his 2nd loan with MFP, and he knows that if he wants to continue to access credit he must be on time with every payment.  At the same time, he is pleased to work with his communal bank because the members are demanding and always recommend that the money be spent wisely.

Josefina has ten children, all of whom depend on her.

With it she was able to start a business selling women's wraps. Previously she only sold fish for lack of capital. But now she sells blankets and  wraps every Saturday and Sunday in the city of La Paz, Bolivia. She is able to, in part, cover her children's and grandson's basic needs.  Her grand son is seven years old. \r\n\r\nShe requests a new loan in the amount of 1000 nuevos soles to purchase more pashmina wraps. Her vision is to keep advancing in her business selling pashmina wraps.

Voaesea has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1000 WST from SPBD, which she used to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles and thread. Voaesea is now requesting her second loan, in the amount of 1500 WST,  to purchase a new sewing machine.

She enjoys a strong reputation in the business and receives a lot of orders especially in winter, but her resources do not allow her to honor them.\r\n\r\nTherefore she decided about a year ago to integrate the Soro Yiriwaso credit loan program, where she is on her second individual loan. The previous loan was successfully repaid in full.\r\n\r\nWith this second loan she plans to purchase from wholesalers three bales of used clothing of different qualities (sweaters, T-shirts, shirts, socks, pants). She resells them as an itinerant vendor to a client base consisting of heads of households from her area.\r\n\r\nShe expects this loan will generate monthly profits of 170,000 FCFA that will be used primarily to increase her business, contribute towards family expenses, and pay interest on the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":941206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"buy bales of used clothing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-12-11T05:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadidiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874428},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283254},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:28Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424765},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140029},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-27T08:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757004},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-22T08:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251767},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-20T08:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410774},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294448948},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502717},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":25860.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268396}],"funded_date":"2011-12-18T02:03:00Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":372990,"name":"Ajelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ajelina is a 40-year-old married woman with three children, all of whom are in school.

Chinbat is 41 years old and lives with his wife and three children in Harhorin, the capital city of the ancient Mongolian empire. He and his family live in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. His son and two daughters attend a local secondary school. \r\n<p>\r\nChinbat operates a raw material trading business in his town. He sells animal skins, primarily sheep and goat skins. He started his business in 1999 after previously working as a driver for a state-owned farm. Over the years, Chinbat has become quite experienced in raw materials trading and has built a stable operation. He is now planning to expand his business in the near future. Chinbat's business is very important to him and his family. He says, \"All I want is to provide for my children's education and raise them to be good people.\" He is requesting a 1,000,000 MNT loan to purchase sheep and goat skins to sell for his business.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About XacBank<\/b><br>\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

Mercedes has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Mercedes is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 6th loan from ASKI.

To make a living, Flordeliza owns & operates a general store selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Flordeliza is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Flordeliza joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Flordeliza is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Flordeliza from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L\u00facia lives in her own house with her family and does not support anyone else.\r\n\r\nL\u00facia became pregnant in sixth grade and quit school.  After the birth of her child, L\u00facia continued to live in her parents' house, and they took care of her during the most difficult time of her life.  Some years later, she returned to school and finished tenth grade.  After that, she immediately took a teaching course in Namaacha District, which is on the border with Swaziland.\r\n\r\nShe quit the class when she got together with her current husband, who gave her the money to start her own business selling pots which she buys in Maputo and resells in Swaziland.  She still does this work on Wednesdays and Saturdays at the open-air market.  L\u00facia earns about 6,000 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses.  She also manages to save some money with the help of the vegetable garden in her yard, where she grows lettuce and cabbage.\r\n\r\nThis is L\u00facia's seventh loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva.  The first six loans were for 5,000 meticais, 5,000 meticais, 12,000 meticais, 10,000 meticais, 10,000 meticais and 10,000 meticais.  They were used to increase her inventory, and she paid them back with no problems.  She is now asking for 12,000 meticais for the same purpose.

A local orchid society, for example, found that their plants responded better to harvested rain water than to tap water, which has been treated with chlorine. Local wineries big and small have also come to Aaron for barrels to store their harvested grapes. \r\n \r\nSince starting his business four years ago, Aaron has seen demand for his barrels rise steadily. While Aaron admits that running a business comes with its own set of challenges, the ability to determine his own schedule is indispensable because he has spent the last fifteen years helping to care for sick and elderly family members. \r\n \r\nA $4,000 loan, his third from Opportunity Fund, will help Aaron secure a new location for his operations, as well as increase his inventory of supplies. As the autumn harvest and winter rainy season approach, his busiest times of the year, Aaron is excited to get the business running at full capacity in a new space. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019d like to find

He is 32 years old. Jovinsol is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJovinsol is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Jovinsol owns & operates a business venture making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling fish balls and other dimsums to the local community. Jovinsol has been engaged in his business for over 12 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jovinsol joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovinsol has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jovinsol is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Jovinsol from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":644174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase new items to expand product offering","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.
