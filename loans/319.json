As she did these businesses, she also leant more experience from other people.

In addition, her husband contributes his salary to the family's income, which makes her family's economy stable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Since her childhood, she has worked in diverse activities in the land, both in growing crops and raising livestock. In this way she has seen, throughout the years, both rewards and failures, but in spite of this she puts great effort into being a farmer. For this reason, she wakes up very early every day to take her cows to the fields to feed and later works on her gardens. But when it is time to sow or harvest, every member of her family participates unanimously to obtain good results. The products that Senobia grows are mainly potato, corn and wheat, which are the products in greatest demand in her region.\r\n\r\nThis is her 15th loan with MFP.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Lucila has been engaged in her business for over 1 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lucila joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lucila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20000 PHP from GDMPC. Lucila is requesting a new loan of 35000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Lucila from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007 IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She works for periods every day because sometimes she doesn\u2019t have anyone to leave the children with and they are still little so her situation sometimes becomes quite complicated but she hangs in there struggling to get ahead every day and progressing in her business.  She sells door to door and through prior orders.  She sells on credit and collects weekly.  She says she loves to sell.

It is based on that fact that he has requested a Kiva loan to buy more cows for re-sale to double the sales and  profits.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":871940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more cows to re-sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kihihi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-09-18T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kirungi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":251281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868720},{"amount":89.59,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":251281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648556},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":251281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313893},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":251281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275489},{"amount":89.59,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-28T08:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":251281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264223612},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-10T08:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":251281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270319228},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-03T08:27:40Z","rounded_local_amount":251281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947343},{"amount":447.92,"local_amount":1250000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-02T08:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1256406.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283315523}],"funded_date":"2011-09-24T12:47:30Z","paid_date":"2012-08-02T08:26:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":340614,"name":"Muliki","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muliki is a 44-year-old married woman with 7 children and she owns a house in Kasese, Uganda.

But it's indeed a challenge for the couple to make effort in making a living especially in sending them to school.\n\nBecause they wanted to buy additional materials for fishing like fishing nets, they requested a loan from  Paglaum MPC in the amount of Php 20,000. They set aside an amount for the fishing accessories and at the same time to put up additional capital for their little sari-sari store.  A back-to-back business actually to make a daily income.  Luzminda has 2 productive years of membership to Paglaum. Aside from the financial assistance they received, they also enjoyed other benefits like insurance and savings.

children.  He has run a coffee shop since 2005.\r\n<p>\r\nImad requests a loan of $700 from Al Majmoua to purchase merchandise for his shop like \u201cNarguileh\u201d and coal.  Nargileh (also known as \u201cShisha\u201d in Egypt) is an ancient tradition enjoyed by the people of the Middle East.  A water pipe is used to smoke fruit flavored tobacco.  Nargileh is enjoyed in cafes across the Middle East, and is beginning to gain popularity in the U.S, Europe and other countries.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the first time Imad has requested a loan.  He is special in his work because his coffee shop is a nice and relaxing place.  He knows how to treat his clients.  When he first started his business, he didn\u2019t have a lot of cash and didn\u2019t have a lot of clients.

Her business is making traditional dresses.  She lives and works in the city of Khujand.  She leases a small factory at the Panshanbe market.

He works for the municipality in her area.  They have four children, but only one lives with them and is still dependent upon them.  The others are independent and have their own families.\r\n\r\nFor 17 years she has devoted herself to dressmaking.  She learned how to do this when she helped her aunt with her seamstress work.  Currently, Jacoba sews and makes clothes for women and children only.  She works at home, where she has the help of one of her nieces who cuts the fabric.  But, this is not the only activity Jacoba does.  She also is very good at cosmetology and cutting hair.  She has been doing that for 23 years, and she has regular customers.  What she likes the best about her work is giving the best of herself so that her customers feel satisfied.  Also, it is profitable because besides offering her services as a seamstress to various people, she also makes clothes that she sells herself.\r\n\r\nThis is her 13th loan with MFP.  What she likes about working with her communal bank is that her colleagues are good people.  They are supportive, and above all, they get along very well with each other.  She will use the money she is now asking for to buy fabric to make more clothes.  She will also get more supplies for her small beauty shop. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":403516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Buy textile materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-11T15:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacoba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":106.49},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":108.99},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":114.15},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":118.72},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":123.13},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":128.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.03},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.93},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.77},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.97},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.03,"local_amount":106.49,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":109.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997655},{"amount":38.93,"local_amount":108.99,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":112.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843007},{"amount":117.73,"local_amount":329.63,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":339.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734583},{"amount":9.41,"local_amount":26.37,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:45Z","rounded_local_amount":27.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959677},{"amount":45.9,"local_amount":128.52,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":132.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992519}],"funded_date":"2009-10-11T21:56:16Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":147269,"name":"Jasmin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jasmin takes good care of her rice field.

She lives peacefully at home with her husband Jhonny, who is 40 years old, and their three children:  Bryan (age 14), Jimena (age 6), and Florentino (age 10 months).  They live in a cramped house that they own in the mountains of Peru.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is a very hardworking woman who spends most of her day attending to her business from a rented location.  Nineteen years ago, Blanca decided to start a beauty salon where she honed her manual skills for styling the hair of clients who seek her services.  There are no other similar businesses like hers in the area, so she is able to generate very good revenues.\r\n<p>\r\nBlanca enjoys working at her salon, but she also manages to have time to look after her children.  A few months ago, she bought a few decorations to sell from her salon.  She keeps these items in a small display case, which was the start of a small bazaar.  Over time, this part of her business has grown as well.  She is able to cope with having two businesses because it allows her to stay ahead and provide the best for her family.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Blanca is very confident that she will be responsible in making each of her payments on time because she does not want to cause problems for the other members.  Her Communal Bank is a very organized group.  Blanca will use the loan to purchase equipment for her beauty salon to make her customers feel more comfortable.  In addition, she will buy merchandise for her decoration sales business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":452976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase equipment for her beauty salon & decorations to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T01:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":63,"local_amount":180,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-26T10:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":181.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734984},{"amount":112,"local_amount":320,"processed_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":322.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153765}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T04:48:11Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":167933,"name":"Angela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angela B., 57, is a hard working single mom.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.\r\n\r\nThe ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.\r\n\r\nKiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new

He has a produce business, purchasing cereals like maize, rice and beans for reselling at a profit. He has been at it for the last 20 years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in Jabalia refugee camp located in Gaza in Palestine. He wants to change some home furniture and appliances and purchase new ones such as: refrigerator, washing machine, living room seats, etc., but the amount of money he has isn't enough to pay, so he wants to get a loan from FATEN. When Ibrahem gets the loan, he will be able to purchase new home furniture and appliances that he needs to live in better home conditions. Ibrahem is photographed in the FATEN branch.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She is married and has two children, 11 and 15 years old.  Since 2004, Rehema has been running a grocery store, where she sells general items, including onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. Rehema's store is popular among the local people, especially at times when they need one or two missing ingredients for cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market.\n\nRehema works 9 to 12 hours a day, 6 days a week and is assisted by her husband. She currently needs a loan of TZH 770,000 in order to purchase additional inventory for her store, such as juice and soda. Rehema thanks everyone for supporting her.\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

He lives and works in Nakuru where he has had a private health practice since 1989. He provides reproductive health, curative services, family planning, PAK and minor surgeries. He is trained as a nurse, in family planning, and general reproductive health.<P>\r\n\r\nJohn sees between 140 and 150 clients a month. His clients range from those in the slum to more middle class people. He says it's important to balance his clientele as oftentimes the clients from the slum cannot pay their bills. He says he sometimes feels guilty but he cannot serve everyone all the time for free.<P>\r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan so that he can repair his car that he uses to visit distant patients. The rest he will use for improvements to the clinic like painting, buying drugs, and repairing the floor. He said the most important aspect is the car, as many of his clients don\u2019t have the means to come to him.<P>\r\n\r\nNote: Mr. M.'s interview was taped prior to an informational meeting where he and other borrowers (all primary care providers) were informed that the maximum amount they could receive for their first loan was $1200 USD . Mr. Yegon agreed that he would take $1200 USD but the interviewer did not have time to re-tape the

She is 48 years old and has 5 children between the ages of 16-35.  The youngest three still attend school and she lives only with her children\u2014she doesn\u2019t have any other family members in her care.  She left Maputo after her father died.  She was very young and her mother did not have the resources to take care of her, so she was taken to Namaacha and cared for by the missionary nuns.  During her time with the nuns she learned to make handicrafts and crochet.  Years later, she met her husband and left her home with the nuns.  She began making crochet projects and selling them to co-ops.  Her work was often praised so she was able to start making large orders for a company in the capital city.  With the income from that project she bought some land.  Later, she separated from her husband and was left with 5 children to care for.  Her life was very difficult, but with the help of the missionaries she was able to overcome those difficulties.  They gave a base and she was able to build some rooms to rent out.  Today she is the owner of 5 small apartments, 2 of which are functioning and provide her with 1.500.00MT per month in rent money.  She is also the owner of two market stalls where she sells large orders of potatoes and onions which she gets from neighboring Swaziland for the price of 160x20 and 170x20, then resells in Namaacha for the price of 200x20 and 200x20.  She saves her money in a xitique (a traditional, rotating way of saving money).  She pays 1.000.00 MT every 15 days among 12 people and each person in the rotation collects the whole account once.  She has never worked with another lending company and this is her first loan with  Hluyuku and with Kiva.  The 20.000.00MT will be used to buy construction material for her apartments.  She is very anxious to finish them so she can begin other jobs.  She is full of projects!  In the future she plans on taking out another loan and becoming a great saleswoman.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Rachel Crouch, Kiva

ASHI is a microfinance institution and KIVA partner in the Philippines. Since then, she started selling ready-to-wear-clothes, which really helped to improve her family's standard of living. She is now seeking her fourth loan from ASHI, this time in the amount of 14,000 PHP ($325), to purchase additional inventory for her business. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for blouses, shirts, sandals, jeans, short pants, and other supplies. She hopes that, with the help of ASHI and KIVA's field partners, she can reach her ambition to step out from poverty, expand her business, and pay for the needs of her two children in school. One of her dreams is to someday own their own house. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASHI: ASHI has the distinction of being the oldest existing replication of Grameen Bank's approach of providing credit to the poor people of the Philippines.

This school was opened in 1985 by the Catholic mission to educate the children of the Kolo Kolo community, on the outskirts of Makeni. Currently, the school is staffed with 12 teachers and has 550 pupils.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan these teachers are accessing from SMT\/Kiva lenders.  School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or to invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nMabel C. who is pictured second from right is the leader of this group of teachers. The 43-year-old was born in Gbonkolenken village, in northern Sierra Leone.

In the picture she is in the first row on the far right, wearing a green scarf and holding a white hat in her hand. She is an ambulatory used-clothes saleswoman. She sells in five different parts of the city, including at the flea market on Yumbel street on Sundays. She takes Tuesdays and Thursdays off.  \r\n\r\nWith her earnings, she helps economically support her family, which includes her husband, her daughter and the two young granddaughters who live with her.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda purchases her merchandise both in fairs and in stores. She plans on investing this loan in clothing and in curtains or other household fabrics. Her dream is to have a set locale from which to sell, in some part of the city.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda very much enjoys the support she receives from her Fondo Esperanza loan officer, and the atmosphere of trust that exists within her communal bank.  She also says that thanks to the loans she has received, she feels more secure in her business.\r\n\r\nPuerto Montt is a city in the south of Chile, located in the Los Lagos region.  The attractions of Puerto Montt are its beautiful green landscapes; its beaches, which are special because they do not have many tourists; its artisan crafts and goods; and its cuisine, especially its reputation for fish and seafood. Puerto Montt is also the port of entry to the Isla Grande de Chilo\u00e9, which is rich in traditions and legends.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4125,"image":{"id":558118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

He remains optimistic about the future and hopes to one day to open his own jewelry store and build a name for himself in this field. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

Even highly-developed, industrial, economically self-sufficient states are confronted by difficulties. It\u2019s the same with the developing country, Kyrgyzstan.

Together with her husband, who earns his livelihood by working as a private builder, she brings up four sons, all in school.\r\n\r\nBesides working in the sphere of passport documentation, Damira runs a family business. Thirteen years ago, having some money saved, she and her husband began their business. The very first step was starting to breed cattle; the second was to increase the number of cattle.\r\n\r\nWith money received from the loan Damira wants to purchase more cattle. In the future, she wants to widen the shed to enable her to keep more cattle and, in order to improve the family\u2019s housing conditions, make thorough house repairs.\r\n\r\nDamira's partners are:\r\n\r\nAigul D., 29, a private entrepreneur, is married and has three children. She opened a shop after getting some money from her husband. Her aim is to extend her business. She wants to expand the assortment of goods and to make major shop repairs.\r\n\r\nZarema K., 32, is married to a builder and has no children. She and her husband earn their living by selling goods in the market. After earning a profit, they bought a refrigerator and a washing machine. The aim of the loan is to expand her assortment of goods. In future she hopes to rent a container.\r\n\r\nKauhar M., 30, is the treasurer of the group. She is married and has five children. She began her business with selling ice-cream. As the business developed, she also began to sell disks and audio cassettes. Her aim is to extend her business.

Insherah is a mother of two sons and is married to Yousef who is a Palestinian National Authority employee.\r\n\r\nInsherah and Yousef run a small grocery store which helps them increase their income as NPA salaries are small. Insherah came to FATEN and took a loan to purchase a larger amount of goods to sell in the store.\r\n\r\nInsherah is a conservative woman, like most Gaza citizens, and doesn't want her picture posted online. Therefore you see her husband Yousef in the picture above.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n \r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":223043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Renovations to a nursery school","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-18T18:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mwanaisha  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970737},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886954},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436214},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:45Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130487}],"funded_date":"2008-11-18T20:15:21Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aiga Stokenberga","image":390110}},{"id":77562,"name":"Siguidja Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":" Les membres du groupe SIGUIDJA sont des femmes mari\u00e9es qui vivent dans des foyers polygames avec en moyenne 39 ans et 5  enfants.

All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  The women are requesting a loan of 100,000 francs CFA each to buy 600 kg of n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds (the fruit of an oil-producing tree in the Sahel region) and firewood for cooking the seeds. \r\n<p>\r\nThe production cycle and actual sales occur over the course of three weeks.  The finished sounbala is taken to Bamako and often to Senegal to be sold in cash and often on credit.  The group members hope to realize an average per-cycle profit of 33,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to boost their working capital.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":233518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou Koulikoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":391.67,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":202104.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889518},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":101052.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440301},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":101052.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135674},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":101052.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033475},{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":101052.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620842}],"funded_date":"2009-01-03T17:32:32Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":81658,"name":"Maria Makyao's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria M., age 45, is married with four children ages 22, 20, 12 and 10.

She's 76 years old (with a first-graD. education), widowed, and has 4 children. She's worked with the Manuela Ramos MFI for 4 years, during which time she has dedicated herself to the retail sale of groceries. Her first loan (300 soles) was used to purchase merchandise (rice, sugar, milk, cooking oil, etc.) for her business. With this second loan for 1500 soles ($475 dollars), which she will repay in 5 monthly installments, she will be able to purchase additional merchandise (sacks of rice and sugar, gallon containers of cooking oils, candies, etc.) She hopes to become fully self-sustainable, which is why she always re-invests her additional profits back into her business (she can afford to do this due both to her age and to the fact that her children now live far away with their own families).

She is married and she has two children.  The first is still studying in preparatory school, and the other is not.  Her husband works and he helps her with the expenses of the family, and also he sometimes helps her in her business.  It has been about three and a half years since she began a business selling fruit.  Later she began another business selling traditional clothing like g\u00fcipiles and shorts.  She sells products on market days, or on Wednesdays and Sundays of each week, in the city plaza of her area.  The loan that she is asking for is to invest in and stock her business, buying more merchandise like aprons and sweaters, because it\u2019s the season for them.  Her dream is to grow her business and to be able to get a location in the city plaza, and also to have a better life with her children now while they are little.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She is 47 years old. Perlita is married and has 5 adult-aged children. To make a living, Perlita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector, running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Perlita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Perlita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perlita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Perlita is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Perlita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:<p>\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He lives with his 30 year old wife, Haydee, and their two children.  Jefferson is five, and Renzo is only one month old.  They are very happy together, and they have the desire to get ahead.  They live in a cozy house, which is their own.  It is located in a peaceful area in the mountain ranges of Per\u00fa.\r\n\r\nAlberto remembers since he was very small how his parents planted on the land where he innocently played.  From then on, he learned everything a man of the fields should know.  He now devotes himself to agriculture.  He gets up very early everyday to take care of his potato and \u201colluco\u201d (Peruvian tuber) crops.  With their sale he is able to pay the family\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nHe currently plants and also maintains his fields alone and without help.  He considers agricultural work to be very profitable.  The harvest produces plenty, and he can also put into practice the knowledge he learned since he was small.\r\n\r\nWhat Alberto wants most is to give his children and his wife the best.  His wife also helps him in her free time.\r\n\r\nThis is his sixth loan with MFP.  He promises to be punctual and responsible in each of his payments.  He does not like to create problems for the other members of his Communal Bank.  They work to improve everyday.  He will use the money he is asking for to buy compost, fertilizers, and insecticides for the care and treatment of his land in order to get a good harvest. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":453342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy compost and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T14:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1224,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672749}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T16:10:25Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":167965,"name":"Blessing","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Blessing U. owns a spiritual shop where she sells spiritual items like candles, oils, spiritual books, and other materials.

children. He is from Lebanon and has been working as an experienced car seller for the past eight years. His business consists of buying cars, making the needed maintenance, and reselling them to make a profit. He is thankful for his business income as it helps him to satisfy his heavy expenses and pay for his children's schooling. He offers his customers all types of car and also works on customer request. Today, he is requesting to borrow $1,200 from Kiva partner, Ameen s.a.l., to perform maintenance on some cars so that he can sell them as soon as possible and make a good profit from them. In the future, he hopes that he will be able to open a used car shop.\r\n<p>\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e. blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About Ameen<\/b><br>\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999.

Her previous job away from home caused family conflicts, but now she is very happy and satisfied with her new occupation.<p> The breeding of pigs and sheep has become an important part of the family income and therefore she wishes to increase the number of animals with the purpose of improving the quality of life of her young children, who are all of school age. She asks for $100 to purchase a pig. Let us help Antolina so she can have more animals and that way ensure the future of her children.<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Lene Struck, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLos deseos  de salir adelante se han convertido en una importante raz\u00f3n de existencia para  Antolina, que a pesar de tener  muchas obligaciones en casa, con el  cuidado de sus hijos y  esposo a podido iniciar la crianza de animales peque\u00f1os.\r\nEsta actividad  le ayuda a obtener ingresos interesantes para contribuir con el bienestar de su familia y debido a que su desempe\u00f1o no le demanda mucho tiempo ha continuado con el diligente cuidado de su hogar; debido a que  su labor anterior fuera de casa ocasion\u00f3 muchos conflictos familiares ahora est\u00e1 muy contenta y satisfecha con su nueva ocupaci\u00f3n.\r\nLa crianza de cerditos y ovejitas se ha convertido en una importante fuente de ingresos y por esta raz\u00f3n desea  aumentar el n\u00famero de sus animalitos con el prop\u00f3sito de seguir incrementando la calidad de vida de sus peque\u00f1os hijos que a\u00fan se encuentran en etapa escolar.

Thi Tran has been a participant with the Fund since 2000.  Before joining the Fund the family\u2019s income depended mainly on working the fields.  After joining the Fund, Ms. Tran has discussed with her family regarding using the loans to invest in retail businesses and opening a restaurant to serve the people in the neighborhood.  Ms. T.\u2019s house is in the center of the town, so she has many advantages in business endeavors.  Everyday her husband goes to buy food from large retailers for her resell and serve the customers.  Thanks to her husband\u2019s help and her determination, the business has improved and become more stable day by day.  Since receiving more income from the business, she has saved up money and built a nice 2-story house and bought some other conveniences for the family.  In this round of funding Ms. Tran would like to borrow 10,000,000 VND to invest more in the store to better serve the customers, increase profit, improve the family\u2019s income, and provide for her two children to attend school.  The family\u2019s income is about 3,500,000 VND per month.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb Th\u1ee7y l\u00e0 th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh Th\u01b0\u01a1ng t\u1eeb n\u0103m 2000.

","en":"This communal bank is called \"Wayna Capac.\"  This is the name of one of the heirs of the Inca throne, who in his governance extended the Incan empire to its maximum extent; he was called \"el granD..\"  The bank is located in the province of Urubamba, which is part of the department of Cusco, exactly one hour and 30 minutes from the city.  This sector is called the sacred valley of the Incas, a place of generous and fertile lands, thus allowing the production of large, rich grains.\r\n<p>\r\nThe associate members of this small bank of nine women and five men are enterprising people, desiring that the association offer them minimal backing in order to be able to continue supporting their families and to continue the tradition of cultivation as in the time of the ancient Peruvians, the Incas.  These associates carry out various activities, the majority of which are agricultural.  They produce organic vegetables, corn, beans, barley, artichokes, potatoes and dried grains among other products.  For this reason they desire to invest their loans in the improvement of their raw materials, which are the seeds, and in the purchase of better animals, as they also raise small animals such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, guinea-pigs and rabbits in order to ultimately breed and sell them.  Other associates will start some small businesses, such as to open a fast food restaurant, selling sandwiches, juices and kebabs.\r\n<p>\r\nThese associates are thankful for the help received and undertake to repay the loan by the proper date.  They truly value the support given, because in the rural areas of Peru, you often can't count on the help of the financial social bank.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Heidi Petersen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3525,"image":{"id":274116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Capital to purchase raw materials, small animals and various products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urubamba - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-02-20T04:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3525,"lender_count":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yobana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milagros Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cleofe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emperatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reynaldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karla Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herbert Perzy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ignacio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2684.58},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2791.97},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2903.66},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3019.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":830.1},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":863.31},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":897.84},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":933.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":830.95,"local_amount":2687.34,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T10:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2704.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27059011},{"amount":862.45,"local_amount":2789.21,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T11:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2807.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35951328},{"amount":1.76,"local_amount":5.69,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44409766},{"amount":1829.84,"local_amount":5917.76,"processed_date":"2009-08-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5956.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139241}],"funded_date":"2009-02-20T06:57:18Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T11:27:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heidi Petersen","image":null}},{"id":93962,"name":"Maria Calixta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Calixta S. tiene la edad de 52 a\u00f1os, su estado civil es casada.

Now, she earns an average monthly income of PHP 2,800 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nGeraldine is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 4,000 was used to fund operations of her general store and food vending, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her second loan, the amount of PHP 6,000, which she intends to use to fund her general store, food vending and rice retailing business.

Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With her first loan from Manuela Ramos of 300 Peruvian sols ($100) she bought additional products such as detergents, soaps, and toilet paper, to add more variety to her store. Currently Rosa sells bread, soft drinks, vegetables, snacks, eggs, etc. <p> With this new loan of 400 Peruvian sols ($133), which will be repaid in 4 months, Rosas will buy additional products such as sweets, cookies, and juices, as a way to continue adding variety to her inventory. She dreams of someday having a house with all the modern comforts and a great store. <p><b>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>La se\u00f1ora Rosa tiene 30 a\u00f1os, su grado de instrucci\u00f3n es secundaria completa, tiene cuatro hijos que aun dependen de ella; vive en el sector Wichanzao en el Distrito de La Esperanza, Provincia de Trujillo, Departamento de La Libertad,  pertenece al banco comunal \u201cSanta Elena II\u201d.<p>\r\nAnteriormente se dedicaba a los quehaceres del hogar y tuvo la idea de poner un peque\u00f1o negocio en su propia casa, una bodeguita.
