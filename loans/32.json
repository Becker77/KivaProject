She is practically a professional when it comes to producing and marketing cassava flour and tapioca.  She has derived a great deal of experience from this business of hers, which she had before getting married.  And she has proved herself to be a good manager.  Yet she is no longer able to meet the expectations of her customers due to a lack of capital funds and thus is always short on inventory.  This situation might create a crisis of trust with her customers if she cannot gain financial support.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nTo avoid this problem, Ms. Z. is requesting a loan of $550 to buy fields of cassava plants (the source of both cassava flour and tapioca) in order to develop her business, which she calls \u00abLe P\u00e9tit Grain\u00bb (The Little Bead) and extend it to Lom\u00e9, the capitol.  The loan will allow her to augment her income to better ensure the welfare of her family.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nMadame Z.

Elle est une v\u00e9ritable professionnelle dans la production et la commercialisation du gari et de tapioca. Cette activit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle exerce avant son mariage lui procure une large exp\u00e9rience et elle fait preuve d\u2019une bonne gestionnaire. Toutefois, elle n\u2019arrive plus \u00e0 satisfaire les demandes de sa client\u00e8le elle est toujours en rupture de stock \u00e0 cause de l\u2019insuffisance de son capital.

Antonio is divorced and has a 4-year-old boy. His wife got sick in Boane (a village in the Province of Maputo, 30 km away from the capital) and decided to have a traditional treatment at her parents\u2019 house in Cabo Delgado. She decided not to come back and to keep the boy, even though Antonio really wanted to take care of his son.<p>\r\n\r\nWhen Antonio was finishing 7th grade in Cabo Delgado, his mother passed away and he failed in school. The following difficult financial situation didn\u2019t allow him to continue his studies. In 1999 Antonio moved to Cuamba to work as a guard and construction worker at the house his sister was building, and he had the opportunity to attend 8th, 9th, and 10th grades. As Antonio is a very dedicated student, he learned English very well and had the opportunity to work at a South African company that built roads. In 2004 Antonio moved to Boane to live with another sister and work at her small stand selling used clothes. <p>\r\n\r\nSoon after, his sister moved to Beira and left him in Boane to take care of the stand. After a small amount of marketing research, Antonio decided to close his sister\u2019s stand and open a stand at the bus and mini-bus final stop selling used shoes and socks. He was the first person to sell socks in Boane and therefore built a very strong customer base. Antonio buys the merchandise in a large warehouse in Maputo every other week. He buys closed packages that contain between 90 to 120 pairs of shoes. There are 3 types of packages: mixed shoes (MTn 2,700), sports shoes (MTn 7,000), and female shoes (MTn 2,500). Antonio cannot see what is inside each package, but lately he has been quite lucky. If he can get a good sport pair of shoes size 8\/9, he can sell them easily for MTn 700. And demand is high! <p>Sometimes Antonio gets shoes that are too old and not in a condition to resell. Antonio makes at least MTn 1,000 per day, and during the end of the month he makes up to MTn 6,000 in a single day. He has a small safe at his house where he deposits at least MTn 100 every day. That is a way of saving and making sure he has money to pay his duties. Antonio\u2019s expenses are small: he rents a small room for MTn 250 per month and pays for energy and his food, besides sending money to his kid.<p>\r\n\r\nThis will be Antonio\u2019s fourth loan with Hluvuku. The first MTn 5,000 was used to buy merchandise, and he repaid it in just 2 months. The second MTn 8,000 he used to buy a refrigerator and a sofa and paid it back in 4 months. With the third MTn 11,000 Antonio had to change his plan of only buying merchandise and used part of the money to pay his uncle\u2019s medication expenses in Cabo Delgado, as he got very sick. This MTn 15,000 will be used to buy merchandise and repair his secondhand motorcycle that is not working. Antonio wants to increase his stand inventory and attract more clients.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future Antonio would like to go back to school and at least finish his secondary degree. He loves studying and dreams of one day going to university. Antonio would also like to expand his business and build a proper store where he would be able to employ people who have the same difficulties in life that he faced. He would like to sell food as well, guaranteeing steady sales during the whole month, and not only big sales at the end of the months. With his hardworking attitude and good business sense, Antonio will definitely succeed in his business and life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":161412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Here in the community there are many needs and a great deal of poverty. The people need work, something to which they may apply themselves in order to earn some money. The men in general do not have work and only offer themselves as construction workers. The women get married very young. This group is near the offices of Vision Mundial [World Vision] and the women's children are sponsored by Vision Mundial. The group is made up of eight women and one man. \n\nSe\u00f1or Alfredo is the group's representative and tells us how things are going in his business. Don Alfredo earns a living raising livestock, he raises and fattens sheep. He has been in the business for twenty years and the most difficult aspect has been when the animals get sick as that represents quite a bit of expense to be able to save the life of a sheep. For now Don Alfredo tells us, he has not had to deal with those mishaps, and when he buys them he only hopes they will bear young and he waits until the lambs are grown to be able to sell them and does not let the sheep get very large. The loan will be of great benefit to Se\u00f1or Alfredo's family since there is a profit when selling the sheep and that helps him be able to bring home food to his family. \n\nThe goals he has in mind are not to give up so that things may get getter and to keep struggling so that his children may have a better life and a better education, better work opportunities and to feel proud of his children. Don Alfredo has eight children of whom only two depend on him, but he wants them to stay in school and not leave school on account of no money. Se\u00f1or Alfredo will soon celebrate his 18th wedding anniversary. He lives in his own home and his wife works in the home. \n\nThe other members of the group are the following persons: \n\n1.-Tomsa, she raises sheep\n2.-Maria Guadalupe, she raises sheep\n3.-Francisca, she raises sheep\n4.-Natalia, she raises sheep and pigs\n5.-Victoria, she raises sheep\n6.-Manuela, she raises sheep and chickens\n7.-Marcela, she raises chicken and turkeys\n8.-Leticia, she raises pigs.

She previously only sold to neighbors, and now with new customers from bordering neighborhoods, she needs even more money to make her purchases.\r\n\r\nHer message to the lenders is the following:  \u201cThanks to God and the Kiva lenders for the opportunity they have given me.  With the loan I received I was able to drive my business and receive profits that were used for my family.  Keep supporting me in order to increase my possibilities.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe will use the new Kiva loan to buy meat and calves that are not yet born.  This is one of the products that her customers request the most, and they turnover very quickly.  Her investment is successful because she has a lot of experience in the market, she works through scheduled sales, she gets an order, and then she delivers it.  \r\n\r\nIf you want to know Belkis\u2019 history go to the following site:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lend\/281705\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":862196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy meat and calves that are not yet born.

He has been involved in this business for 5 years.  <p>\r\n\r\nTohir will use his loan to purchase two young bulls to fatten and resell.  Every 40-45 days he will sell the livestock and will use his revenues to purchase new bulls.  Tohir will use profits from the sale of livestock to support his family as his teaching salary is low.  This loan will provide him with a secondary source of income.

To enhance the family\u2019s income, Mrs. H. considered raising poultries, but back then she didn\u2019t have the capital to put her plan into practice. This motivated her to become a member of TYM Fund, from whom she would be able to request for loans. In the first round of loan, Mrs. H. asked for 3.000.000 VND, which she used to buy pigs, ducks and raised them. As a result, the family\u2019s financial situation has been improved a lot. Mrs. H. is currently breeding 9 pigs for meat and 200 ducks for eggs. In this round, Mrs. H. would like to ask for 9.000.000 VND to invest in poultries.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married and has three children. His wife is a retailer whose income is no longer able to cover the household expenses; it is for this reason that he decided in 2000 to start a business selling charcoal, something normally conducted by women. He runs this business in the Saint-Joseph district in Lom\u00e9. This business has allowed him to provide for his family. He enjoys good business these days and is proud of his income-generating activity. Currently, he needs to buy new bags; it is for this reason that he is seeking a loan through WAGES (one of Kiva's field partners) to buy 15 bags of charcoal.

covered in rice fields, enveloped by the crystal water of the sea that meets the foot of the mountains with wide tree plantations. Every morning, Mary Ann\u2019s husband used to go fishing, while Mary Ann was left at home attending to the needs of their children and making herself busy doing household chores. When their children were still young, Mary Ann was content to only perform this role. However, now that all of their children are studying, she realizes that she has to exercise an economic role to augment the income of her husband. Therefore, in 2008 she joined ASHI and requested a loan which she used for starting up her own business. She bought cattle to fatten. After two loans, she realized that her profit from cattle fattening is double the capital, once it is sold after six months. Resources in their surroundings, especially during this season of rain, can provide enough food for the cattle she is raising. Now, she is requesting a much larger loan to buy more cattle for raising and to be able to increase her profit as well. In her business lies her capacity to send all of her children to college to better their future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":403927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

es la cuarta secci\u00f3n municipal de la provincia Santi Iva\u00f1ez, del Departamento de Santa Cruz. Est\u00e1 dividida en cuatro cantones con 65 comunidades campesinas.  De acuerdo al \u00faltimo censo realizado el a\u00f1o 2002, la poblaci\u00f3n de El Torno alcanza a 40.000 habitantes.\nEs una poblaci\u00f3n joven, constituida por emigrantes venidos del interior del pa\u00eds: del occidente, quechuas, aymaras y de los valles del oriente, as\u00ed como de las personas aut\u00f3ctonas.\nComo caracter\u00edstica de Santa Cruz, existen grandes diferencias sociales que conviven en un mismo espacio. Junto a grandes \"quintas\", propiedad de terratenientes y personas de mayor poder adquisitivo en Santa Cruz, conviven los propios habitantes de la zona, con construcciones mayormente sencillas (adobe y techo de motac\u00fa). Existe una diferencia entre las poblaciones de Santa Rita y Santa Marta 1 y Santa Marta 2, que se encuentran al borde de la carretera antigua a Cochabamba, donde se encuentran viviendas de ladrillo y teja junto a las m\u00e1s sencillas, y las poblaciones campesinas que se encuentran hacia el interior de la monta\u00f1a, que son puramente de adobe y motac\u00fa, con condiciones mucho m\u00e1s sencillas, donde no llegan el agua y la luz.\nEstas poblaciones se encuentran a una distancia de entre 5 y 20 kil\u00f3metros hacia el interior (en la zona pastoral que deben atender los voluntarios). Dicha zona pastoral est\u00e1 compuesta de 9 comunidades, a las que se accede por caminos de tierra por los que a veces pasan vagonetas para poder acceder a ellas.\nLa econom\u00eda de la poblaci\u00f3n se basa en la producci\u00f3n agropecuaria y frut\u00edcola, as\u00ed como el trabajo de extracci\u00f3n de piedra, ripio y arena del r\u00edo Pira\u00ed que circunda a todo el municipio. Tambi\u00e9n existe una gran actividad de comercio, especialmente en la poblaci\u00f3n de El Torno, donde se instala el mercado en que se venden los productos del trabajo campesino.\n\nEl Sr. Lauro primero trabajo en alquiler o al partido (trabaja para el due\u00f1o de la tierra y despues se parten la cosecha) saco un credito de EMPRENDER para comprarse 2 hectareas de tierra ahora el esta trabajando en su propia parcela y espera un credito  para seguir comprandoce mas parcelas de tierra osea 2 hectareas mas y asi poder sembrar Papa para luego ir a comercializar en el mercado de la zona, esta agradecido con Emprender y Kiva por la confianza brindada en la otorgacion del credito.\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n","en":"Lauro was born in Mojocolla Chuquisaca, on the 24th of July, 1981.  He has been living and working in San Luis El Toro for the past eight years. (El Toro is the fourth section of Santi Iva\u00f1ez province in the Santa Cruz department.)  It\u2019s divided into four areas with 65 rural communities.  The last census in 2002 showed that the population of El Toro was 40,000.  The population is young and includes many people who have relocated from other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nMany social differences exist in Santa Cruz.  There are large luxurious homes collocated with homes of simple construction (adobe and thatch).  There is a difference among the populations of Santa Rita and Santa Maria 1 and 2, located along the ancient Cochabamba road, where there are brick and fabric homes located alongside simpler homes.  The people living more into the mountain have simpler adobe homes with no running water or electricity.\r\n\r\nThese people are located between 5 and 20 kilometers to the interior (in the pastoral zone that must be serviced by volunteers).  This zone consists of nine communities, accessible via dirt roads.  Wagons sometimes pass through.\r\n\r\nThe economy of the region is agriculture based, as well as on stone and river sand extraction from the Pirai river, which encircles the entire town.  There is also a large business activity, especially in El Torno, where the rural population\u2019s products are sold. \r\n\r\nLauro first worked as a sharecropper (he worked for the owner of the land and then splits the harverst with him).  He got a loan through EMPRENDER so that he could buy two hetaeras of land which he is now working.  He is asking for this loan in order to buy 2 more hectares of land and be able to raise potatoes to later sell in the market.  He is grateful to EMPRENDER and Kiva for trusting in him and for granting this loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":506870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farmland\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lauro Claudio \t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151879803},{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172100779},{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188668631},{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201272984}],"funded_date":"2010-04-06T20:33:10Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:51:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Lorna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lorna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for her future education and the improvement of her business.

He is 30 years old, single, employed, and has a 9 year old son who is in the fourth grade.  For the past five years, Walter has been making doors and windows out of glass and aluminum.\r\n<p>\r\nWalter started working in this trade after he completed his fifth year of secondary school since he had no other way of paying for a university degree.  He left Palacaguina to find work and went to Estel\u00ed.  A cousin helped him out by offering him an apprenticeship at a glass and aluminum workshop where he started out as an assistant.  Three years later, he was able to teach other young people since there were more orders for doors and windows.  Once he worked five years at the workshop, Walter decided to become independent and start working alone.  Over time he was able to buy tools with the income from the orders he received.  Whenever he receives large orders, Walter will find assistants to help him complete the work.  He also travels outside of the region to look for new customers.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan he is requesting will be used to buy materials such as aluminum, screws, and tools for his job.    This will help facilitate his work so that he can complete his orders and provide better quality finishes to the doors and windows that he produces.  As a result, he will be able to attract new customers.  Walter has future plans to open his own shop and furnish it with modern equipment of high quality, as well as hire permanent employees.  \r\n<p>\r\nHis immediate goals are to acquire sufficient materials to complete the large orders he has received.  Walter has money saved up to secure a good education for his son since he was not able to continue his own education.  He has faith that his son will be able to accomplish this.  In addition, Walter would like to have a vehicle to help him deliver orders and transport equipment more quickly.

hijienico, de libretas, libros etc. El compran este tipo de material para fabricar laminas de carton, la elaboracion es sencilla ya que se muele toda la materia prima hasta obtener una pulpa de papel, despues se pone a secar al sol,  es uno de los desafios que frecuentemente ha tenido ya que si sale el sol es muy dificil que pueda secarse, esto pasa frecuentemente cuando llueve, lo que causa una gran perdida en sus ganancias, porque la lamina obtenida ya como producto la vende, sin embargo es una persona muy trabajadora y nunca se desanima ente esta situacion.\nLas ezperanzas que tiene don

He is a single father with two children.  One of his children is 15 years old and in his last year of junior high school.  Next year he will start high school.  His youngest son is 7 years old and in the second year of elementary school.\r\n\r\nLuis Manuel tells us that he has a cardboard-making business.  It is a family business.  He tells us that his father was the one who started the business 11 years ago. \r\n\r\nLuis Manuel has requested this loan to buy raw materials such as card, newspaper and all kinds of paper (toilet paper, notebook paper, books, etc.)  He buys this type of material for making sheets of cardboard.  The manufacturing process is simple: all the raw material is ground to make a paper pulp which is then put out to dry in the sun.  One of the challenges that he has frequently faced is that if the sun doesn't come out it is very difficult to dry the pulp.  This often happens when it rains and it means that he loses a lot of profit.  However, Luis Manuel is a very hard-working person and he never lets himself become discouraged when faced with this situation.\r\n\r\nLuis Manuel hopes that his business will grow so that he no longer has to request loans although he tells us \"I am grateful for the help that FRAC and Kiva give me because it has been a great help.

Anastasia lives on a small piece of land where she keeps cows and grows a wide variety of crops, which she has been doing for 10 years. Her primary sources of income are milk and horticultural produce. Her biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals, to prevent these diseases. Anastasia joined Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help him improve her farming activities. Anastasia is requesting a loan, which she will use to expand her horticulture farm.

She used the funds from those earlier loans for traditional farming practices of raising pigs. Though not hugely successful, her family could get by and she managed to save a little.

This entrepreneurial decision has proved that she hit the right demand. The income is huge, 4,000,000VND a month. Her husband and two children take turn to maintain and run the business.

She is grateful to the Manuela Ramos movement for contributing to the fulfillment of her dreams and goals.  \n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":384143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy ingredients for preparing her meals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-09-14T17:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delfina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":202.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074955},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T01:58:09Z","rounded_local_amount":202.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990318},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":202.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835286},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":202.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727024}],"funded_date":"2009-09-15T17:00:05Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:06:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":139110,"name":"Clarisse","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Y.

She is 55 years old. Glorita is widowed and has 6 adult-aged children. To make a living, Glorita owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector selling charcoal. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling charcoals to their community. Glorita earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Glorita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Glorita is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional charcoals to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Glorita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":442900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

To make a living, Clarecil owns & operates a general store, selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap & boost food in the local community. Clarecil has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Clarecil joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Clarecil has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Clarecil is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Clarecil from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Roza wants to make another source of income and start new type of business with the loan, that she had requested among local financial institutions. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program envisages provisions for business startups and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who, regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, do not have access to credit products. With the received credit, Roza will purchase stock of various home products, such as bed linens, mattresses, utensils and will sell in her community in increased prices. \nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva startup loan, will significantly increase the family's income.

With a capital of Rp750,000 (about US$83), Komang Wati raised a mother pig. This pig was raised very simple and traditional. The food given was a mixture of rice shell clippings and pounded banana tree trunk . That pig was fed 2x\/day, and the feed expenses per pig is Rp6500 (about 72 cents). In 4 months the pig gave birth to 9 piglets. She sold them for Rp1,575,000 (about $172) at Rp175,000(about $18)X9. After subtarcting Rp1,000,000 (about $110), her profit from this sale is Rp575,000 (about $62). She usd the profit to pay for her child's schooling expenses, who now sits in 7th grade; also to pay for other Komang Wati's household expenses, since her tenant farmer husband does not have a steady income. With a loan from Dinari in the amount of Rp1,300,000 (about $145), Komang Wati could expand her business, and expect to buy another mother pig for Rp800,000 (about $88), and 1 piglet for fattening for Rp250,000 (about $27.50); and the rest to buy animal feed. Komang Wati hopes that she could increase her profit, and make her family more prosperous.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nUsaha beternak babi sudah ditekuni Komang Wati sejak lama .Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp.750.000, Komang Wati memelihara 1 ekor babi penginduk. Babi ini dipelihara dengan sangat sederhana dan tradisional. Makanan yang diberikan adalah campuran dedak padi dengan batang pisang yang sudah ditumbuk. Babi tersebut diberi makan 2 kali  dalam satu hari sehingga biaya yang diperlukan untuk satu ekor babi tersebut sebesar Rp.6.500. Dalam waktu 4 bulan babi ini sudah melahirkan anaknya sebanyak 9 ekor, Dan laku dijual seharga Rp.1.575.000 (@ 175.000 x 9 ) ,dari penjualan ini diperoleh keuntungan sebesar Rp.575.000 ,Setelah dikurangi biaya sebesar Rp. 1.000.000 selama enam bulan. Keuntungan ini dipergunakan untuk biaya sekolah satu orang anaknya yang kini duduk dikelas 1 SMP, dan juga untuk memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangga Komang Wati mengingat suaminya seorang petani yang penghasilannya tidak pasti setiap bulan. Dengan adanya pinjaman dari Dinari sebesar Rp. 1.300.000 Komang Wati dapat mengembangkan usahanya dengan membeli 1 ekor penginduk lagi seharga Rp.800.000 dan 1 ekor bibit babi penggemukan seharga Rp.250.000 ,sedangkan sisanya digunakan untuk menambah modal pakan ternak.

She is the coordinator of her group, Paz y Amor (Peace and Love), and her story is representative of the other borrowers in the group.\r\n\r\nYessenia and her husband live with their three children in a simple home from which she also runs her small business. Yessenia sells necklaces, earrings, Avon beauty products, toiletries, and perfumes, and also makes custom clothing for her clients. With this loan, her ninth loan from Esperanza International, Yessenia plans to buy a new sewing machine and more inventory. \r\n\r\nAs in most of the Dominican Republic, life in Samana can be very difficult. Running potable water is unavailable, electricity is scarce at best, and healthcare and infrastructure are inadequate. \r\n\r\nDespite these difficulties, Yessenia has bright hopes for the future. She plans to continue expanding her business with continued access to loans.

Her average income per month is about 150 USD.\r\n\r\nOur next borrower is Kanayim. She is 44 years old and the mother of two daughters, both pupils. Her husband is a builder, usually working in Uzgen district. Kanayim keeps some animals. Either she looks after them at home or sends them to pasture because the cost of keeping them is less there. Her loan will be used to buy two calves. \r\n\r\nGulzina is 25 years old. Her husband is in Moscow and is working as a builder there. With her husband\u2019s family she is involved in farming.

Bunyod is a 29 year old businessman. He is married and, together with his wife, they have 3 kids. Bunyod is a farmer, like his wife. They started their work 5 years ago. The beginning was very difficult, because they needed to invest a lot of working capital. With much effort and the help of his wife he was able to move forward and today has a large plot of land. His vegetables are very good quality which he says is due to the constant irrigation they receive since the business has a complete underground irrigation system. They sell their products in the fruit and vegetable market of the city. Bunyod requests the loan for the purchase of fertilizer and seeds. This will allow him to better provide for his family.  \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband Ramil, who is 36 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have one child who is 12 years old. \r\n\r\nBelly joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Belly has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,500, increasing the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 8th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use for the maintenance of the motorcycle and to buy stocks of clothing so that she could continue to save up for future education of her child and home repairs. \r\n\r\nBelly S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

She will become a mother very soon. At present  she is living at her mother's house with her 6 brothers and sisters. Maritza works at her parent's small farm along with her brothers. They sow potatoes and she likes it because it is very profitable. The sack of potatoes sells for 60 to 65 soles ($18-20), but they have to pay 3 soles ($1) per sack for transportation; for this reason Maritza prefers to wait for the buyers to come to her small farm and this way to save on transportation, because the buyer takes the product. After they harvest the potatoes, they sow pea grains because the land is quite rich in substances that fertilize the ground, therefore they don't need a big investment. They only need to look after it to prevent plagues.\r\nMaritza has been a member of MFP (Kiva's partner) for almost 3 years. This is her 6th loan, and she is committed to continue with the same dynamics of work and of punctual payments. The requested money will be use to buy fertilizers, also a bag of pea seeds to sow at the small farm where they will harvest potatoes, in order to increase her production.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ana Gabriela Clark, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":261609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy seeds and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-28T05:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2070.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080106}],"funded_date":"2009-01-28T12:05:54Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:34:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ana Gabriela Clark","image":22141}},{"id":89936,"name":"Maria Olga","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Olga inici\u00f3 el negocio por que a\u00f1os anteriores tambi\u00e9n manejo el negocio de venta de ropa por un periodo de 3 a\u00f1os, lo dejo  pero despu\u00e9s quiso volver con la ventas ya se hab\u00eda acostumbrado a tener un  ingreso adicional adem\u00e1s que conoce mucha gente pero  se decidi\u00f3 por la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos y le agrado mas este negocio y siente que adem\u00e1s que lo maneja mucho mejor  le va muy bien y tiene mucha facilidad para vender. \nComenz\u00f3 el negocio hace 5 a\u00f1os primero quer\u00eda surtir algunos perfumes y cremas solamente ayud\u00e1ndole a una persona para as\u00ed ver ella  como se sent\u00eda sigui\u00f3 metiendo pedidos pero ya por su cuenta viendo que la gente respond\u00eda y pasaron alrededor de 8 meses y de repente vio que tenia much\u00edsima clientela  y le ped\u00edan de todo cremas cosm\u00e9ticos perfumes tratamientos  para darse abasto pidi\u00f3 el cr\u00e9dito para tener existencia de mercanc\u00eda antes tenia que ofrecer a diario por las casas de la gente que conoc\u00eda pero ahora en la actualidad los mismos clientes llegan solos.\nEl negocio de la Sra.

before Helen A., 54 years old, became a member of ASHI in 2008, rice production (rice farming) was already her business. When she joined ASHI, she started a hog fattening (pig raising) business while she was waiting for her rice crop to reach the harvesting stage. Through hog fattening Helen also felt that she could have a source of capital for her rice production business. She would use the funds from selling her pigs towards the rice farming. She would also be able to run her rice production business independently from the allowance given to her by her two single sons.\r\n\r\nHelen has four children and a farmer husband. Her two eldest children have their own families now, while her third son has been working abroad for a year. Her youngest son works in a factory in Manila. Helen and her farmer husband work their farm and hire farm laborers only during planting season. Every planting season, Helen worries about the expenses that her farm requires to produce rice. She doesn\u2019t want to oblige her children to provide for her financial needs. For this reason, she wants to expand her hog fattening business. In the hog fattening business, profit can be as much as double the amount of capital after only four months of raising pigs. The more pigs she has to sell, the more Helen will profit. With the loan Helen is presently requesting, she will buy more pigs and she will also finance the planting of rice.\r\n\r\nWhen Helen\u2019s business becomes stable, she would like to help her children to send their children to school until graduating from college.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":384222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Will

G., 31, was born on December 6, 1977. She is married to Victor G. and they are blessed with one child who is in elementary school. She and her family live in Silang, Cavite, a province just South of Manila.\r\n\r\nArline has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for three years. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow twelve times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative. The reason why she was consistent in paying her loans was because she used almost all of the money she borrowed to buy and sell assorted feeds to her increasing consumer base.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 26,000 loan. This amount will be mostly used to buy additional stocks of rice, different beverages and assorted canned goods for her variety store.\r\n\r\nShe prays that her business will continue to grow so that one day it will become a mini-grocery. She hopes that some day they will have enough money to send their child to college and that they will have a chance to travel around the world.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":446617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He lives with his parents in the small town of La Pava, Mochum\u00ed district, located an hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe has worked as a farmworker since he was very young, and he works in various fields in the area. This work does not provide enough stability to cover his expenses and also help his parents. For this reason, for a year he has also been working selling firewood and raising animals.  \r\n\r\nJuan buys the trunks of recently cut carob trees from sellers in the area and he cuts them in smaller pieces so that he can offer them to his customers in  \u201carmadas\u201d (bundles of firewood) containing 30 units. He also raises barnyard animals to sell to merchants who visit the area from time to time. \r\n\r\nHis firewood business is useful in the area where he lives because the majority of families there use firewood for cooking. For this reason Juan is planning to expand his business, and is requesting a first-time loan of 1000 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa. He will invest the money in the purchase of more carob tree trunks with which he can get more customers.\r\n\r\nJuan is well known in the area in which he lives. His neighbors and customers hold him in great esteem. His greatest wish is to help his parents get ahead and to offer them a better quality of life.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":468811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of carob tree trunks in order to sell firewood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La Pava - Mochum\u00ed - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-01-13T18:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":68.77},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":74.09},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":72.6},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":77.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":78.54},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":81.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":84.46},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":85.69},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":90.77},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":95.45},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":98.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.07},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.93},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.41},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.18},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.49},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.4},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.4},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.4},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":24.07,"local_amount":68.77,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":69.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900360},{"amount":25.93,"local_amount":74.09,"processed_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":75.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934520},{"amount":25.41,"local_amount":72.6,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":73.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662132},{"amount":27.18,"local_amount":77.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":78.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694837},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":78.54,"processed_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":79.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877889},{"amount":28.4,"local_amount":81.16,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":82.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617928},{"amount":29.56,"local_amount":84.46,"processed_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":85.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832335},{"amount":30,"local_amount":85.69,"processed_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":86.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098955},{"amount":131.96,"local_amount":377.04,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":382.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554415}],"funded_date":"2010-01-13T22:47:48Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

It is located in the south-east part of the city and has a population of 50 million.  Milena began her business of selling perfumes, clothing, shoes, and cosmetics five years ago because she needed to earn her own income.  She got a loan from her family and since she is well organized, was able to grow her business over time.

This enabled her to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nHer primary goal is to make her business stand out by creating an infrastructure that will allow her to showcase her products.  In other words, she would like to have her own point of sale.  Her dream is that her young son gets the best education possible and she is working toward that.  Now her only challenge is collecting the money that some of her customers owe her, because some have not kept up with their payments and she has had to be patient and renegotiate their debts.

Sangi Riverside, Toledo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and a house for rental. Her husband Pablo L. is 58 years old and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 31 to 35 years old. \r\n\r\nNelia  joined NWTF - Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 cycle loans from NWTF - Project Dungganon, Nelia  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 26,400, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future of her family. Nelia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

Ryskul lives in a town called Karabalta with her husband and two children ages 5 and 3. Ryskul started her business career at a very young age and by this time has reached impressive outcomes. The couple has been involved in cattle breeding since they started living together. But three years ago they decided to quit this business and start something new. After reviewing the best options, and their own skills, Ryskul and her husband opened a small caf\u00e9.\r\n\r\nThe first challenge in making a business plan was choosing the location. There were too many cafes in their hometown, so they looked for a less competitive environment. The perfect spot was the busiest route in the country, connecting two major centers, Bishkek and Osh. Every day thousands of passenger buses and cars take this route. There are picturesque views and sightseeing, but the passengers complain of having a lack of places to stop for lunch. Ryskul and her husband sold all of their cattle and invested the revenue in building a caf\u00e9. It has been three years, and Ryskul\u2019s expectations turned into reality. Ryskul is the chief cook and her husband is the manager and a caterer of all necessary supplies. The family was able to buy new furniture for their house and an automobile. The profits from the business have reached 40,000 monthly, but along with it the inflation and transportation costs have increased the caf\u00e9\u2019s expenses. Ryskul is requesting a loan in order to buy some inputs and raw materials for running the caf\u00e9. If everything goes well, Ryskul dreams of opening another small shop near her caf\u00e9. \r\n\r\n       --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She\u2019s married and has five children ranging in ages from 16 to 34.  Lilia is a woman with much risk capacity in business, she says.  Since 1992 she\u2019s been working in various businesses.  First she sold chicken in restaurants.  In 1993 she had rented a restaurant and went into food sales.  In 1994 she started a business selling merchandise, especially shoes that she\u2019d bring from Bucaramanga and when her husband started working for a firm they opened a store.  They bought display cases that they stocked with a variety of products displaying them well, a business that today she runs with a profit margin no less than 7% selling paper goods, school supplies, natural remedies, toys, accessories and home decorations.  Her customers are primarily her neighbors that she sells to for cash.  She also has a select group of customers that she sells to on credit.\r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is the second loan she\u2019s gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to pay cash for a large volume of stationery supplies, which is the merchandise with the highest turnover rate.  This will mean a higher profit margin for her thanks to the discounts she\u2019ll get paying cash.\r\n\r\nSince getting her first loan she\u2019s managed to regularize her business in the municipal Chamber of Commerce.  Now her goal for later on is to add a restaurant specializing in the food of Santander to her store and to continue running her household with the dream of seeing it prosper more each day.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":772727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" to buy stationery supplies for cash and in larger volume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-20T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83053},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99685},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101595},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103542},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105527},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":107550},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":109611},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":111712},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":113853},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133872}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.57},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.97},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.06},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.17},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.31},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.47},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.57,"local_amount":83053,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:31Z","rounded_local_amount":84993.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673734},{"amount":55.9,"local_amount":99685,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":102014.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320297},{"amount":56.97,"local_amount":101595,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:29Z","rounded_local_amount":103968.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803427},{"amount":58.06,"local_amount":103542,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":105961.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614501},{"amount":59.17,"local_amount":105527,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":107992.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568467},{"amount":60.31,"local_amount":107550,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":110062.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779810},{"amount":61.47,"local_amount":109611,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":112172.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188218},{"amount":62.64,"local_amount":111712,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":114322.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324444},{"amount":63.84,"local_amount":113853,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":116513.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038507},{"amount":75.07,"local_amount":133872,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":136999.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650697}],"funded_date":"2011-05-24T20:24:28Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":303849,"name":"Roberto Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Roberto padre de familia de 29 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su esposa y su hijo en su  casa propia; no cuenta con los servicios b\u00e1sicos, ubicada  en la zona rural del distrito de Olmos, a una hora de distancia del departamento de Lambayeque.

She practices mixed farming and sells milk, eggs, and various food crops at the local market. Daisy passionately loves poultry farming, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. \n\nDaisy is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. She will use her excess maize to feed the poultry and will provide sorghum to give the poultry energy and green grams (beans) for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg production, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will further increase her income and profit margins. Through increased profits, she intends to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. \n\nIn addition to profits, Daisy will benefit from chicken manure, which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer. She will be able to save money that would have been spent to buy fertilizer. \n\nThanks to your support, Daisy will succeed in making her dreams come true; take action and give a loan!\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2027407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daisy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":993089,"name":"Eunice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eunice is 57 years old.

It was only through very hard work that Dolores was eventually able to earn her own stand within the market, and it is with that same diligence that she continues to work everyday from 3 am to 6 pm, doing everything within her power to continue growing her business and her clientele.

Francisco is married and has 5 children. All children are currently attending school.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1971, Francisco moved to Boane, a village 30Km away from the capital city Maputo, with his family. He studied until 8th grade and stopped because of financial and transportation difficulties. The secondary school was located in Maputo and public buses or mini-buses were almost inexistent and very expensive. Francisco started to work with his father, a goldsmith. Francisco and his father used to buy raw materials in Maputo, but with the Mozambican civil war, they started buying in the north of the country instead, which increased their production costs.\r\n<p>\r\nToday Francisco has a small store in Boane where he sells his jewellery as well as clothes. Francisco makes earrings, rings and necklace with red gold, the local available raw material.  Francisco buys the gold in Maputo at MTn 600 per gram. Earrings are his most popular products and are sold for MTn 250 to MTn 2,500. Francisco\u2019s wife works at the store and they make between MTn 3,000 to MTn 6,000 per day. The other products that Francisco sells he buys in Maputo 3 times per week, going with public transportation. \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Francisco\u2019s third loan with Hluvuku and first with Kiva. The first MTn 10,000 was used to buy raw materials to work as a goldsmith. The second loan of MTn 30,000 was used to start a wood business that didn\u2019t work out. Francisco planned to buy wood in the north of the country and sell in Maputo, but as he was new to the business he didn\u2019t forecast all the difficulties and failed. This third loan of MTn 12,000 will again be used to buy raw material (mainly gold), so that Francisco can produce many products to sell. He would like to increase his store\u2019s inventory to attract more clients and increase his monthly income.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future Francisco would like to have a gold manufacturing company, producing earrings and rings in large quantities and selling to all jewellers in Maputo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":161533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy

Working the soil and caring for plants is part of his life.  Since his childhood he has carried out these jobs, but last year he wasn't able to do the planting he wanted because of an increase in fertilizer prices.  The price rose to 215 soles per sack where it had been 60 soles.  Because of this difficulty, the money he had for that investment was not enough to cover the cost.
