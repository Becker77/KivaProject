Shuhratjon is 24 years old, married and has two children. For the last two years, he has made a living as a taxi driver using his own vehicle. Shuhratjon's goal is to provide high-quality service at a reasonable price. He works hard to make his business stable and profitable, as he is the main bread-winner in his large family, which includes his parents. He is always ready to work, from early morning till late at night, in order to keep his current customers and win new ones. As with any business, Shuhratjon must make investments from time to time. And at the present moment, his car needs repairs. To make this possible, Shuhratjon is applying for a $800 loan for 12 months. He thanks everyone for supporting him and promises to repay the loan in a timely manner. Please help him improve his family's life.   \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Teresita has been engaged in her business for more than 15 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to make furniture. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase raw materials to make furniture. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Teresita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers, and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

lives in Margarita, Brgy. Calumangan, Bago City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her ready-to-wear clothes, peanut butter, and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000. \r\n\r\nJosephine is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can purchase more stocks to sell.   This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. \r\n\r\nJosephine aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). \r\n\r\nThrough the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She has been designated as a mother caretaker for wawa wasi (a daycare center for the children of low-income, working mothers). She needs capital in order to expand her general store. She would also like to improve her house\u2019s condition so that she can take better care of the children, thus obtaining her goals little by little.

She is married and the mother of two children. Fozila has been a seamstress since she was very young, learning in her mother's shop. With a lot of effort, she has been able to open her own shop at her home and has been successful because her customers have recognized the high quality of her products. In this way, she constantly adds new clients and has seen her business grow. Today, Fozila is applying for her fourth loan through IMON International. She is requesting a loan of 4000 Somoni (US $1150) for the term of 12 months for purchasing new, modern fabrics for sewing national dresses. You can help improve the quality of life of her family. Fozila and her children are grateful for your generosity and support.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets (including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is very experienced in his business as he has been farming since 1994. He is married with two children. His elder elder son and wife help him with the business. Unfortunately, Otaboy's farmland is infertile, so he is in need of a loan in the amount of $2500 to purchase seeds, fertilizer, fuels, and lubricants to use on his wheat and potato crop.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>Otaboy hopes the loan will allow him to increase his rice yield above and beyond what it was in previous years. As for his future plan, he wants all of his children to go to university, get good jobs, and be an important part of the wellbeing of this humble family.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/p>\r\n<p>Tajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is married and has seven adult children.  Suititi owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting decorative plants for sale.  Suititi has been engaged in this business for over seven years and earns approximately 500 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nSuititi joined Kiva partner SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Suititi has successfully repaid a previous loan from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  Suititi is now requesting a loan of 1200 WST which will be used for the same purpose.  The loan will be her third loan from SPBD.  Suititi plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":382864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She is a teacher in a local school. Considering the low wages teachers earn, Nasiba started her own business of processing and selling apricots nine years ago. Dried fruit, especially dried apricots, are very popular in Tajikistan and are good for one\u2019s health as well. Considering the constant demand for these dried fruits, Nasiba\u2019s apricot business is quite successful and has resulted in a significant and stable income benefitting her household and the education of her dear children. \r\n<p>\r\nToday Nasiba  is requesting a loan of $1500 USD. She is going to use the loan to purchase more apricots with the purpose of expanding the range of apricot products she sells. Nasiba expresses her gratitude to everyone who supports her. Help this woman of much strength and courage to keep working. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout Tajikistan: \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture and new Western cultures and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout IMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services.

This financing will help her achieve her goal of increasing her investment to gain greater benefits. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":573273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buying a large cooler and merchandise such as soft drinks, hair accessories, etc. to expand her investment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.18,"local_amount":835.83,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":838.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166771220},{"amount":37.65,"local_amount":803.2,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":805.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172205119},{"amount":40.12,"local_amount":855.8,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":858.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330806},{"amount":40.37,"local_amount":861.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:44:05Z","rounded_local_amount":864.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465962},{"amount":41.55,"local_amount":886.39,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":889.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189098092},{"amount":42.41,"local_amount":904.73,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:27Z","rounded_local_amount":907.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348668},{"amount":43.36,"local_amount":924.93,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":928.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766343},{"amount":90.36,"local_amount":1927.79,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1934.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209398}],"funded_date":"2010-08-08T04:29:42Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T09:56:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":221462,"name":"Nemesia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nemesia D. is from the town of Villa Rose Cabarroguis, Quirino.

She has lived there for 9 years. She worked in artisan workshops, where she learned all the necessary steps to make artisan objects,. Five years ago she set up her own workshop where she makes carved gourds, and she has succeeded in becoming very well known in her area. In this way she works all day with the help of her children, every week producing the necessary quantity of carved gourds to then be sold wholesale to the dealers in artesania. \r\n\r\nTherefore she manages to supply herself periodically with the essential materials to make these objects. One of the materials is the gourds, which she obtains in the north of her country. She enjoys the work that she does because it is a manual art that she has mastered, and therefore she wants to have more customers to increase her earnings.

She is a woman with a lot of creativity because she makes the napkins herself.  She has been making napkins for six years.  She has two daughters.  Juana is 18, and Margarita is 15.  They help her weave.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy because her business is going very well for her.  When people have a party or a banquet they contract her to make the tablecloths and napkins.\r\n\r\nZoila makes her payments to the microfinance institution every week.  She really likes her work, and she does it with pleasure because her customers like her merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe requested the loan to buy more yarn and fabric to make her napkins.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nBelen operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Aside from this, she also earns additional income from a room that she offers to be rented in her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP  41,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nBelen hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":871333,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-09-17T14:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":41000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":190,"local_amount":8199.99,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:01Z","rounded_local_amount":8217.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764634},{"amount":253.33,"local_amount":10933.01,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10955.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571755},{"amount":253.34,"local_amount":10934,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":10956.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529305},{"amount":253.33,"local_amount":10933,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":10955.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738523}],"funded_date":"2011-09-17T22:08:00Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":340322,"name":"Ketty","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ketty tiene 33 a\u00f1os, es una mujer alegra y muy trabajadora, convive con su pareja y sus dos hijos, de 14 y 9 a\u00f1os.

She is married with three sons and two daughters. Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. Sabreen wants to improve her family's home living conditions by purchasing necessary new home furniture such as bedroom furniture for her children, living room furniture, a kitchen table, etc., but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay for it, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Sabreen gets the loan, she will purchase what furniture the family needs to live in better home conditions. Sabreen is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

They continue to rely on candles when the lights go out, which they mention can last up to 8 days during whenever it rains due to their geographical conditions. They believe a solar system will have great value through saving on their electricity costs and will eliminate the need for the use of candles in their homes when there are blackouts.

the community. Sarah often employs someone to help her since she tries to stay open at all times and her other responsibilities do not allow her to always be at the salon.  \r\n<p>\r\nSarah is looking for a loan of $550 to buy more products for her salon. Because Sarah mostly does women's hair, she will be buying hair-treatment chemicals, braids, and weaves.\r\n<p>\r\nSarah continues to try to expand her business because she has four children of her own and six orphans to support. Although Sarah does have a husband, she says he is not helpful financially and thus the burden of providing for all ten children falls on her.  All of the children she cares for are school-aged and so she has large school-fee bills each year.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the profits that Sarah made with her last loan, she was able to start a second business running a calling station in front of her salon. Community members use this calling station to make calls if they do not have phones of their own.  She hopes that this loan will be able to make her profits grow even more now that she has this second business.

Orsa will spend the money she receives to buy baby chicks and the feed to raise them.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Lucas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":303970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase baby chicks, and chick-feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-16T04:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":110.27},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":112.13},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":116.77},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":120.69},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":128.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":131.88},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":137.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":142.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.84},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.62},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.63},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.83,"local_amount":110.27,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:31Z","rounded_local_amount":111.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012445},{"amount":36.44,"local_amount":112.13,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":113.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596034},{"amount":37.95,"local_amount":116.77,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":118.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990298},{"amount":39.23,"local_amount":120.69,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":122.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211423},{"amount":41.62,"local_amount":128.05,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":129.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640932},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":131.88,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":133.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080399},{"amount":44.63,"local_amount":137.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":139.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996582},{"amount":46.44,"local_amount":142.88,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":144.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842082}],"funded_date":"2009-04-16T08:27:36Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Lucas","image":133535}},{"id":105910,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is 40 years old and married with four children.

(0) is a 38-year-old woman living in the town of Vaitoloa. She is married and has 7 school-aged children. To make a living, Kisa owns & operates a business venture in the food sector, running a food stall. The main source of income for the business comes from selling baked goods in the local community. Kisa has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nKisa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Kisa has successfully repaid a previous loan from SPBD. This previous loan was used to invest in renovating the business. Kisa is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD. Kisa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

region of Uganda.  She is single and has no children.  She has a business of selling food like matooke (steamed green plantain) and sweet potatoes, which she has had for two years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hairrat has requested a loan of 100,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more matooke and sweet potatoes to sell.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Hairrat hopes to generate greater profits and help to pay school fees for herself so as to complete her studies.  In the future, she hopes to study up to the university level.    \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in micro-finance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":581711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He shares half the stand with his wife, who also collaborates with Fondo Esperanza; she makes clothes for Barbie dolls as well as items for the home like sheets, drapes and tablecloths.  Both work in the market every day but in different parts of the commune since the market rotates among them.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 will use this loan to buy materials to make floor paint and general merchandise.

He received a $450 credit to open a workshop, but it was not well equipped. Despite all his talent, his work well done and his dynamic nature, he could not effectively meet the demand of his clients. Plunged into further difficulties, Mr. N. found a new strategy for attracting clients: building furniture and displaying it in front of his workshop. This highly profitable activity requires a large financial investment, and so Mr. N. is asking for $1000 in financial support to outfit his workshop and buy small tools and wood for making and selling furniture. This will increase his business and his income, and improve his family\u2019s living conditions.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Lisa Molle, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9 en 1966 \u00e0 Akoumap\u00e9-Kpota, Monsieur N.

It floods during the rainy season and the community is semi-urban.<p>She displays her grocery alongside a road, where she has a stall, for people to buy. Her main challenge is working in the open and the seasonality of what she sells. When there is scarcity, the prices run so high that the clientele shrinks, and the prices run very low in times of abundance. The short life of vegetables sometimes forces her to sell them off at low prices to avoid total loss.

(0) is a 55-year-old woman living in the town of Falevao.  She is married and has 7 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Seirosa owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Seirosa has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2004, Seirosa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Seirosa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1100 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  Seirosa is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Seirosa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":382955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married to Ireneo L., an auto electrician, and is the mother of an elementary-aged child. By the grace of God, Lorence has managed to support her child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her child all the way through college. This is the dream of most Filipino parents like Lorence, who herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n<br>Lorence operates a meat shop where she also sells native milkfish delicacies such as boneless ones, meat-filled ones, and other products of the like. For her meat shop, she buys live pigs from hog-raisers. The pigs are then slaughtered and sold to the immediate community. She has many customers who buy the cut meat and then sell it on their respective market stalls. There are many customers who prefer Lorence\u2019s products since they are assured of their freshness and cleanliness. It is also a little cheaper to buy meat from an independent meat shop than the ones in the market that sometimes use the services of professional slaughterhouses for their meat. The cost of slaughter is added to the final price of the cut meat, and passed along to the customers. Thus, Lorence has many customers who regularly anticipate her meat and processed milkfish. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. She earns a minimum of 600 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue to operate her business, Lorence is requesting a loan of 22,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy live pigs to be slaughtered and sold every day. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Lorence dreams of being able to give her child a good, high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her own market stall someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":597089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

C., 42 years old, weaves traditional Mayan woman\u2019s clothing, including belts called fajas, exquisite tops called huilpiles and head dressings called cintas. One huilpil can take up to two months to make depending on the design, and sells for up to US$200. Some of the designs tell a story of the region and others are unique designs created by the artist.  A hair piece called a cinta  can take up to 15 days to create and can sell for US$35. As with all traditional women's clothing in the mountains of Guatemala, the special designs signify what village a woman comes from. \r\n<P>\r\nThis loan will be used to buy more yarn for weaving.

She maintains that it has been worth it because her rice farm income has been very helpful in meeting her family's daily needs.\r\n<p>\r\nRoselyn plans to buy fertilizers and seeds with her loan of 15,000 PHP, making it truly worthwhile. She is hopeful for a better yield this time, especially since her children's needs are growing in number.

He was also looking for a way to create a stream of extra income and become his own boss, so he researched possible businesses. He discovered an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) franchising opportunity which met his criteria. By placing and maintaining ATMs at hotels and other travel businesses in the Washington D.C. area, Don earns part of the convenience fee busy travelers pay.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019s ACCION USA loan will allow him to expand by adding another ATM placement. He plans to continue growing his business, hoping to eventually hire staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Tederlita has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 4,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Tederlita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Tederlita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI, a Kiva partner. \n\nTederlita is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Stephen will educate his children and invest in raising livestock.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Ngamilo group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, Stephen is pictured with his group members.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":914995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T04:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Calistus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gentrix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":43400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":475,"local_amount":43400,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":45115.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680721}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T13:28:57Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":360875,"name":"Yacine","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme Yacine est une jeune d\u00e9butante dans le commerce car cela ne fait qu\u2019un 1 an qu\u2019elle s\u2019est lanc\u00e9.

Coming from a family of seven children, she left school very early because her parents, short on funds, had preferred to send the boys to school to the detriment of the girls.  So she turned towards an apprenticeship in dressmaking.  Unfortunately, since completing her apprenticeship five years ago, she lacked the money to open up her own shop.  She worked outdoors at home using sewing machines she rents from friends and acquaintances.  But with the quality of her work, she received a lot of orders that are filled late just because of a lack of machines available.  Her customer base continued to grow and grow, so using the little money she saved, she decided to lease a shop of her own called \u00abYoyo Couture\u00bb.  But she still runs up against the problem of finances.  Her husband, a furniture maker without a steady income, finds himself unable to help her despite his willingness to do so.  A very level-headed and energetic young woman, Yolande needs financial support to make things work.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nYolande is requesting a loan of $950 to renovate her shop and to buy two sewing machines.

She will walk the streets with her products and sell them to interested buyers. She will continue selling bread, fruits and vegetables along with the new bedspreads and ponchos.  The markup for these items is better than that for fruits and vegetables so she hopes to save a little to get ahead in life.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria is not married and has 8 children. The 3 youngest children live with her and attend school. Schooling is something Maria never had the opportunity to do.

She is very proud to see her children better themselves through education as she betters herself by participating in the Friendship Bridge microfinance group. As a member of the women's group, Flor de Liz, she benefits from the informal education portions of each monthly meeting.
