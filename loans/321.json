in Los Chiles, located in the northern region of Costa Rica.\n\nLike many member of the Los Chiles community, Gabriel is a farmer and dedicates his time to the planting and harvest of various subsistence crops including tuber(a type of plant structure that stores nutrients) and chili peppers.\n\nGabriel is always busy: when he isn\u2019t tending to the needs of his own plot of land, he hires himself out as a laborer on a nearby farm. The money he earns helps to complement the income generated from the sale of his own produce.\n\nGabriel organizes his day so that in the morning he wakes up early, eats breakfast, and then feeds his cows and pigs. He spend six hours per day working as a laborer and in the afternoons he switches gears, taking on the work in his own fields.\n\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Habanero chili peppers. Specifically, Gabriel will use this money to purchase seeds, fertilizer, tools, pesticides, and other materials and ingredients necessary for the production of chili peppers. All labor and transportation tasks will be carried out by Gabriel and his family.\n\nGabriel dedicates part of his time as a hired hand on a nearby farm. He worries about the coming harvesting season and hopes that he will be successful this year. Gabriel\u00b4s goals are to maintain stability in his family, achieve higher production rates, improve his economic situation, and offer a better standard of living to his family.\n\nA major difficulty and limitation for Gabriel has been his lack of working capital. He hopes to use this loan effectively to improve life on the farm for everyone.\n\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan.

Her husband is a farmer and cultivates cacao.  <p>\r\nNine months ago, Josefina took a loan from our organization and used it wisely and the loan has been repaid.  She invested the money in the purchase of beauty products such as hand and body lotion, hair treatment lotion, shampoo, rinse and other products for nails and the skin. That activity had a very positive impact on her life and her family.  With benefits from business, she could buy new uniforms and other school supplies so that her children could keep on going to school.

As more family members arrived, her house would fill with joy and love, but at the same time, the family expenses would increase. For this reason, Eusebia decided to buy and sell sheep for a living, and with diligence and perseverance she has been able to move this business forward.

They specialize in selling food spices and traditional utensils for cooking, etc. The relationship among the women of the Djiguiya group is one of neighborhood bonds and friendship. They are on their third solidarity loan from Soro Yiriwaso and all previous loans were repaid without problem. They get their supplies from a variety of sources depending on the item, but for utensils, they mainly buy their stock from local people in the surrounding villages. For food spices, they go to Bamako or S\u00e9gou. Sales take place in Konobougou, either at home or in the market, especially on market days when customers are itinerant merchants from neighboring towns and villages. With this loan, the members of the Djiguiya group expect to make a monthly profit of CFA 20,000, which they will use to pay the loan interest and invest the remainder in their respective businesses. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLes membres du groupe Djiguiya sont mari\u00e9s avec une moyenne d\u2019age de 37 ans et 7 enfants.

She is married and has six children. Currently, all her children are out of  school and independent. Rebecca\u2019s husband is a farmer. Rebecca, her husband, and two grandchildren live in the  family home, in the town of Oda, in eastern Ghana. Most of the people of Oda are either farmers or sell agricultural products. Very few people have non-farming businesses. \r\n\r\nRebecca is a baker and also sells in second-hand clothing. She buys fabric and second-hand clothes, including bed linens and men's and women's clothing, from Kumasi, a nearby city. She sells these items from a stand in the Oda market square. She also travels to nearby markets to sell her wares. Rebecca has been in this business for thirty-five years now and is asking for a loan to increase her working capital so that she can buy fabric and clothing in bulk. \r\n\r\nShe believes the loan would help her to expand to other market centers and eventually help improve her family's standard of living. She is a member of the \u201cNtoboase\u201d Trust Group.

However, she is very constant when it comes to her embroideries, as their complexity and thickness on the fabric take a month's work. The end result is a beautiful traditional garment, admired by her customers, who buy in cash. The most profitable period for her business is during the Feast of Santiago, which is widely celebrated in her area. She would like to increase the production of embroidered skirts and recruit more staff to help her. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP. She is very happy to have financial backing because she has always proved to be responsible in the management of her payments. She also enjoys being part of her loan group because all members are responsible and very supportive. She thanks those managing the loan request, which will be very helpful in the development of her business. She will use the credit to buy more fabrics and yarns in different colours, as well as seeds and fertilizer for planting alfalfa.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alba Sort , Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":574105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buy fabrics and yarns in different colours.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.72},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":241.43,"local_amount":666,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":681.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887452},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:33Z","rounded_local_amount":340.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154454},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":340.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449763},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":340.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588465},{"amount":121.44,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:20Z","rounded_local_amount":342.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724969}],"funded_date":"2010-08-01T19:16:24Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alba Sort","image":550650}},{"id":221930,"name":"Con Esfuerzo Se Crece Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The communal bank \"Con Esfuerzo se Crece\u201d (With Effort there is Growth) consists of 15 associates from the city of Vi\u00f1a del Mar.

A. is a 35-year-old member of Life in Africa's WE Centre Gulu. Her husband died of an operation in 1996, but she does not know what sickness he was suffering from. Joska has seven children and three dependants who are orphans (from her brother who died of HIV\/AIDs). Her three youngest plus those of her brother are in primary school.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJoska sells produce (rice) to get money to cover school fees and daily needs. She buys this rice from a market in Amuru District and sells it to consumers in one of the markets within Gulu Town. She also makes paper beads at Life in Africa and gets some money out of this, which has been helping her with the expenses of daily life. Her problem is paying school fees for these children she is left with.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJoska has saved 80,000= (Uganda shillings) from her business of selling rice. She is requesting a loan of 250,000= (Ush) to add on to her savings and expand her business.

Rasul is dedicated to farming activities and has been engaged in this activity for 20 years. Presently he is the father of two children.

His reason for coming to IMON International is to obtain a loan with which he will buy seeds and fertilizer for his crops.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She had benefitted from several \u201csolidarity\u201d loans (group loans) in the past, and is now on her 11th individual loan, which will allow her to purchases 15 sets of wax \u201cpagnes,\u201d six sets of embroidered cloth, and five sets of dyed \u201cbazins\u201d of mid-range quality in Bamako.

She is 42 years old. Yolanda is married and has four adult-aged children. To make a living, Yolanda owns and operates a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing hairdressing and beauty services to local community members. Yolanda has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 9,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Yolanda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Yolanda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used to  purchase materials needed to provide service. \r\n\r\nYolanda is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand services provided. This will be the second loan taken out by Yolanda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He and his family live in a ger, which is a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. His oldest son attends a local secondary school. <p>\r\n\r\nErjan operates a meat-selling business in his province. He explains that herders drive herds anywhere from 100-200 km to sell their livestock in the capital city of the province. In Mongolia, it is common for a household to buy at least one cow and ten sheep to be eaten during the long Mongolian winters. People of this province usually prepare their meats for winter in October and November and finish those prepared meats in March. As a result, Erjan plans to sell his products during the spring season. He usually purchases livestock from herders and slaughters the livestock to sell at the local market.

Such companies as Bishkek-Sut and Vimm Bil Dan provide the residents with high quality milk products. According to statistics an average person consumes milk products at least once a day.\r\n\r\nBusara J., 47, is a leader of this group. She is married to a farmer and has a twelve-year-old daughter. She started her business of milk production in 2003 and hasn\u2019t regretted it at all. First she purchased a dairy cow and sold the generated milk to friends from the neighborhood every morning. Busara's business became so popular in the neighborhood that she had to buy more dairy cows in order to generate more milk. Soon local ice-cream and cake producers started purchasing her milk on a regular basis. They liked high quality of this raw material. The next idea was to diversify her products. Busara bought new equipment for making high sorted cheese, sour cream and butter. She loved how everything worked out and sold all of her products almost immediately. The reason Busara applied for this loan is that she\u2019s in need of new equipment for making milk products because her old one is getting exhausted. Busara\u2019s dream is a two-storied big house where her daughter would be happy to live. \r\n\r\n      --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

lugar donde se encuentra en grupo, solo llegan los taxis especiales pero la gente casi nunca contrata este tipo de taxis ya que es muy caro y no tienen para pagar tanto dinero entonces deciden caminar.\nDecidieron ponerle Capilla San Juan as\u00ed porque el lugar donde se re\u00fane el grupo se encuentra a lado una capilla que es la m\u00e1s importante de la comunidad y San Juan porque as\u00ed se llama la comunidad donde se encuentra la capilla.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Magdalena quien es la representante del grupo tiene 46 a\u00f1os de edad esta casad con el se\u00f1or Martin desde hace

su hija Anayeli  y por eso mismo le dieron la tienda escolar, en la actividad lleva ya 2 a\u00f1os de los cuales su \u00fanico problema fue que las ventas bajaron mucho ya que en la escuela le

and it has 11 members, two men and nine women.  All the members live in the same location where transportation is very scarce.  One has to walk several kilometers to reach the place where the group meets.  Only the special taxis go there but hardly anyone contracts this type of taxi because they are very expensive and they don\u2019t have enough money for them so they decide to walk.  They decided to call it Capilla San Juan because the place where the group meets is next to a chapel which is the most important one in the community and San Juan because that\u2019s the name of the community the chapel is located in.\n\nMagalena, 46, is group representative.  She\u2019s been married to Mart\u00edn for 29 years.  Four children were born to this couple and they are all still dependent.  Laura, 17, is no longer in school, Amalia, 15, is no longer in school either, Amancio, 12, who is in second year of secondary school and Anayeli, 9, who is in elementary school.\n\nMagdalena runs the school store where her daughter Anayeli attends which is why she was given this store.  She\u2019s been in business two years and the only difficulty she\u2019s had is that sales dropped very much when she was forbidden to sell sweets and junk food for the children.  This hurt sales because now children bring lunches from home and don\u2019t buy from Magdalena anymore.\n\nThis time she\u2019s asking for the loan to buy apples, oranges and one or the other sweet that she has been authorized to sell.  She also prepares meals but only for the teachers.\n\nHer goal is to manage to have another business where she can sell vegetables.  She and the group are grateful and they commented: \u201cThanks to the loan we\u2019ve been able to make our businesses grow and this has improved out quality of life.\u201d\n\nAll the group members will invest their loans differently.

A widow for several months, she now has the burden of taking care of her entire family alone.\r\n<p> \r\nTo meet her family's financial needs, she has been storing and selling the vegetable \"gari\" and corn flour for the last 5 years. This very profitable activity has enabled her to contribute to household needs until the death of her husband. Today, faced with her new situation, Mrs G. cannot make ends meet with her business. Concerned with the education of her children, she would like to build on her business but does not have the necessary means. Her experience and management skills enabled her to refund her first two loans promptly. The new credit of $650 that she is requesting will be used for the purchase, the storage and the resale of gari and corn.

For example, the store owners purchase their vegetables from the farmers when they harvest their crops.\r\n<p>\r\nConstence Kessewa is one of the leaders of the group. She is a single mother of 6 and owns a small farm of tomatoes, garden eggs, pepper, onion, corn, plantains, and cassava (used to make fou-fou, a staple of Ghanaian cuisine). Constence is now 55 years old, and hopes to save enough money for her children\u2019s education before she becomes too old to farm. She is using her loan to purchase more crops because there is a demand for them.\r\n<p>\r\nAnother farmer of the group, Ernestina O. (now 57), is also wanting to stop farming because she is getting old. Ernestina grows cassava, plantains, coco yam, and tigernuts. She is using her loan to purchase a new variety of tigernuts. Tigernuts are normally sold in Ghana to eat by itself and is the size of an almond, but tastes like coconuts. This new variety of tigernuts is in high demand because they can be used to make biscuits, cakes, and gin. Sadly, Ernestina\u2019s daughter just passed away in a motor accident. She left behind a store, which Ernestina hopes to renovate with her profits from the farm. This will allow her to work indoors with less physical labor.\r\n\r\n(*photo note: Several members of a different lending group from the community joined in the photo out of excitement)"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":85098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Mostly to purchase crops such as tigernuts, plantains, cassava, tomatoes, garden eggs, corn, pepper, and onions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Nkawkaw","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.55 -0.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4225,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Constence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Comfort","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hannah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salormey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Birago","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ernestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":null,"disbursal_currency":null,"disbursal_amount":4100,"repayment_interval":null,"repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":4225,"local_payments":[],"scheduled_payments":[],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28547,"name":"Jameo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jameo owns the Hanifa Fashion Designer Store.

N., 41, is married and lives with two of her children in the Siem Reap province.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Here are some details about the different activities they are involved in:\r\n\r\nMr. Carlos Antonio N. is 29 years old and lives with his parents.  He buys and sells water and firewood that he hauls in his own two-wheeled cart and horse.  He has done this for the past 10 years.  Carlos is soliciting the loan in order to buy more firewood.  The firewood in this community is used by almost all the inhabitants as the majority of people cook over a fire.  Carlos goes out to sell firewood in different locations and in isolated villages where not many people sell this type of product.\r\n\r\nVicenta I. is 60 years old and is in a common-law relationship.  She has no dependants as all her children are married.  Vicenta buys and sells firewood to her neighbors and friends.  She has done this for the past 8 years.  She is soliciting the loan in order to buy more firewood.  She needs to buy 8 cartloads of firewood now as the price will soon increase which makes it hard to make a profit.\r\n\r\nGustavo Eduardo R. is 25 years old and single.  He sells firewood.

The official name of this borrowing group is 'Fely F.'s Group'. \r\n\r\nFely is married to Victor F., a carpenter and at the same time a farmer. They were blessed with 2 children; one is an adult and the other one is a teenager. Fely is engaged in operating a sari-sari (variety) store.

Her main source of income comes from her sari-sari store business and she earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from this activity. She\u2019s been engaged in this kind of business for a year already.\r\n\r\n In April 2010, Fely joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. As a newly recognized member, she is now requesting a loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to add to her capital for her sari-sari store business.

They still go to her, and refer more clients her way every day. Now, her business' potential to grow has exceeded what she is able to do on her own; her clientele is growing every day, so Sandra's need for working capital is becoming more and more evident. The money that she currently has is not enough to meet her customer demand, especially now that the most important holiday season is coming up: December. For this reason, she has turned to a Kiva loan. This is her first loan with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. With this loan, she will purchase beauty products in order to stock up on the tools that she needs. This will allow her to offer a good service.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement.

Together with his wife, Tsolmonbaatar sells second hand clothing and and also transports passengers from Tsetserleg city to Ulaanbaatar, the capital. In July 2008, Tsolmonbaatar and his wife bought a freight train cargo container for 3,000,000 tugrig ($1 USD=1,570 tugrig) and converted it into a bicycle repair shop. Their daily gross income is 15,000-25,000 tugrig and the profit ranges between 7,000-15,000 tugrig a day.  They have taken two loans from XacBank (Kiva's microfinance partner in Mongolia) and paid back both loans on time.  Tsolmonbaatar and his wife put a lot of heart into their business and they complement each other in this family activity.

They live in an area called Brisas del Ozama, by the Ozama River shore. The river divides Santo Domingo in two halves. Maritza and her friends live on the eastern side. Maritza has 5 children, ages 24, 22, 19, 18 and 16. Only the two youngest ones still live with her.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maritza mostly sells children's clothing, which she buys in bundles (she told us there are tons of children in her area). However, with this loan she will buy a bundle that includes sheets and curtains (at her clientele's request) and a bundle of jeans. There are many men who do handwork that wear jeans everyday. They have asked her to buy men's jeans, so they can buy them from her. Her male clients say she sells good clothing at a fair price. One of the challenges Maritza faces as a businesswoman is to recognize trustworthy customers. ''You might encounter unreliable people that won't pay you.\" <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maritza would like to set up all her merchandise at a store and add more variety to her sales. For example, she might like to add shoes to her merchandise in the near future.

She is a 30-year-old married mother of 3 children, 2 of whom are in elementary school while the other is in preschool. <p>\r\nHer youthful spirit and her need to help with the household income motivated her to start her own business, and what better way to do it than with her first 300.00 PEN loan. With this money, she had a wooden case made so that she can use it to sell candy to her customers\u2014the students and teachers of an educational center near her home. Thus, she started her business, which she is still running today. Everyday, sales are good, which makes her happy. For that reason, she works double shifts\u2014in the morning at one educational center, and in the evening at another. <p>\r\nShe will invest this 800.00 PEN loan in purchasing sweets, such as: Sublime white chocolate, Ca\u00f1onazo chocolate crispy wafers, lollipops, bubble gum, cookies, and candies of different brands and flavors so that she can keep her customers satisfied. She will also invest some of the money in purchasing small toys that her young customers ordered. <P>\r\nShe feels very satisfied with her work, even though it takes up a lot of her time. She thinks it is worth the sacrifice because she can realize her dreams and reach her lifetime goal of getting her own house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":332571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase candy to increase inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":137.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52985483},{"amount":45.95,"local_amount":133.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":138.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205898},{"amount":45.71,"local_amount":132.99,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:50:26Z","rounded_local_amount":137.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635138},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":137.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074195},{"amount":45.95,"local_amount":133.68,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":138.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989602},{"amount":45.73,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":137.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834601}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T18:33:58Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:39:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":118698,"name":"United Club 5 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Wahr is a 32-year-old man who was only able to get to 10th grade in school.

Lilia has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately $112 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lilia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Lilia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Lilia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional new items for sell. This will be her 5th loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 56 years old, married, and has two children who work on their own.  Elvia started her business 22 years ago selling sweets to children.  She gradually reinvested into her business and added basic grains to her inventory, which is what most people buy from her.  Elvia says the objective behind starting her business was to look for an alternative source of income to support her children.  Her husband was out of work at the time due to illness, which prevented him from securing permanent employment.  However, this business has helped her family get ahead and prepare her children for college.  \r\n<p>\r\nAt the moment, Elvia is requesting a loan to purchase merchandise, mostly basic grains which she is able to sell more of in exchange for cash payments.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Gilberto V., a security officer, and is the mother of three children, two of whom are already working. The other child is still studying in college. At this time, Marilyn is working hard to be able to send her youngest child all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Marilyn, as she herself has been a high school graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMarilyn runs a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries and beverages in small amounts to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five Philippine pesos' worth of cooking oil or an egg. Her store is located next to her house. Marilyn also sells viands (prepared dishes) just beside her small variety store. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail piece rates. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue running her businesses, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy more products such as groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She will also use part of this loan to purchase raw ingredients for her food stall. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilyn dreams of being able to give all of her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work in her business. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group\u2019s weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of god she receives. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis. The fellowship groups gather to study the word of god, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":753730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional stocks for her store and raw ingredients for her food stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-04-22T08:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":723.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123612},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2892.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194996},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3615.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474070},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2892.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636851},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":723.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005178}],"funded_date":"2011-04-22T12:26:42Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kirsten Foster","image":510473}},{"id":295741,"name":"Francoise","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francoise is 42 years old and married, with two children who are 14 and 19 years old.

\n","en":"Sangali is a 31-year-old man. He is married and has three children. His wife is a home-maker and looks after the children. Sangali dreamed of becoming a geologist from his childhood. He likes geologists' work. For this reason after graduating from school he went to university, to the geology faculty.\r\n\r\nI believe that geologists should conduct their business systematically in four directions. Their duty is to work regularly in the field; to study materials; to follow developments in science; and to announce the results of their research in print. Geologists spend a lot of time in the field, working in sparsely populated regions and mountains. A geologist's main tools are a geologist's hammer, a pencil and a notebook for documenting outcroppings and noting conceived hypotheses. Sangali has been doing his favorite work for eight years. He is very glad that he found this work.\r\n\r\nSangali has lived in an old house for many years, and he wants to renovate his house and improve his children's and wife's living conditions. Unfortunately, he has not been able to save up money for the renovations and Sangali has decided to turn to you for a loan. He has need of financial support."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1907273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal

Working as a weaver and selling the mats she creates, Mrs A. is able to provide for her family with her small revenue. She has just received a large order for a special line of 400 mats. The order comes from a centre which trains juvenile delinquents. The mats ordered are of a large size and require more work because the logo of the centre needs to be inserted. Mrs A. and her team don\u2019t have the necessary resources to do the work.  She is asking for a loan of $750 to buy the needed materials and to hire a few people so the work will be done quickly.

She has been raising cattle for 9 years. Musharaf\u2019s husband works as a driver and her two daughters work at a confectionery. Musharaf began her cattle business since she moved to <i>dacha.*<\/i> Then, she had a cow and a calf. In 2005, when Musharaf joined MicroInvest, she received $150 loan. Gradually, she expanded the size of her farm and increased the number of cattle. Musharaf improved quality of life for her family. She increased her business assets to $1000 on which she receives $600 income. In the future, Musharaf plans to increase the variety and headcount of her livestock.\r\n<p>*TRANSLATOR\u2019S NOTE. The meaning of the word <i>dacha,<\/i>as it used here, is different from that commonly found in an English dictionary. Since the late 80s, it became increasingly popular in the former USSR republics for the local government to sell or distribute small parcels of lend to people (oftentimes as small as 20 x 20 meters) for building <i>dachas<\/i> or summer houses. Since collapse of the USSR, many dacha owners turned them into tiny farms to feed their families.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva

Mrs. N. has been a member of TYM Fund since 1999. In the first round, Mrs. N. borrowed 1.000.000 VND to buy and sell ducks\u2019 eggs and raise ducks. After that, Mrs. N. realized that raising ducks and selling their eggs herself would be more profitable, so she has been investing all the loans of the next rounds to breed ducks for eggs. She is currently the supplier of ducks\u2019 eggs for people in her neighborhood and adjacent areas. The business helps Mrs. N. earn about 4.000.000 VND per month. Her two grown-up children make about 3.000.000 VND per month. In the next round of loan, Mrs. N. would like to borrow 15.000.000 VND ($925) to buy more ducks.

Juliana thanks you for your support!\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":404162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-10-12T09:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliana  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":120083.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868373},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":120083.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757569},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":120083.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146663},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":120083.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984808},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":120083.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015481},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.65,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:46Z","rounded_local_amount":120083.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740487}],"funded_date":"2009-10-16T06:40:11Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":147493,"name":"Marites","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marites M.

L\u00f3pez, age 22, is single and does not have children.  When he was very little he left his house and lived with his uncle.  Now he takes care of his uncle and financially supports him.  He does this because his uncle has been his mother and his father ever since Areil was very young.  His uncle is elderly; his is 80 years old.  He devoted himself to cultivating a small parcel of land.  But, now he is very worn out.  Also, he suffers from rheumatism, and he cannot always pay for his medicine.  Ariel takes care of buying his medicine and his occasional treatments.\r\n\r\nAriel currently works as a \u201cmoto taxi\u201d (three wheeled motorized vehicle) driver for the 2 de Agosto syndicate.  He has been an active member for over three years.  The service that he offers is profitable because a lot of people request this service for its ease, rapidity, and efficiency.  The syndicate has stops and shifts for each affiliate at different points in the Ivirgarzma location.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with our institution.  He will use the loan to buy a new motorcycle.  That way he will be able to provide better service to his customers.  It will also allow him to improve his income.  He will consequentially improve his quality of life.\r\n\r\nAriel C. L\u00f3pez came in person to CIDRE's offices to ask for a loan after his coworkers told him of the institution's good credit conditions.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny
