India, and multiple states in the US. He says that along the way his family was a part of every socioeconomic class, from \u201cthird world rich\u201d to \u201cfirst world poor\u201d. His father built oyster and shrimp hatcheries all over and taught Andon about the customs of Latin America. In 2008, Andon took a journey from Appalachia to Yucatan to learn about how he can contribute to forest restoration- this is how Andon\u2019s non-profit, New Forest Earth, came to be.\r\n\r\nNew Forest Earth works with community cooperatives in Mexico and Ecuador to bring handcrafted, sustainable goods to customers in the United States. These goods vary from recycled paper journals, jewelry made from plants in the Amazon rainforest, and USDA organic, Rainforest Alliance certified chocolate. The goal of the business is to fund reforestation and indigenous cultural development projects. The organization has a large support group, including interns from universities and even children as young as 12, all trying to raise awareness amongst their peers.\r\n\r\nAndon hopes to expand his business across the United States, and with this loan from Accion USA, he will purchase inventory from co-ops, which will allow him to sell more products and in turn contribute to the mission of reforestation. \r\n\r\nHelp New Forest Earth raise awareness by visiting the website here:

Awad is a hard worker; he built a small cottage years ago to provide his family with their daily food for their living. Awad makes and sells specially made noodles, lupines, and corn. This kind of food is highly attractive to children in his region, especially during the evening and while celebrating holy occasions.\r\n\r\nAwad has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua in order to increase his food business by buying a large quantity of noodles at a discount. Awad also works in construction, specializing in cement work.

He has a shop in his home that he works in all day.  He makes two coffins per week and later sells them to funeral companies and in this way generates income.  Up to now, he has been very satisfied because this has allowed him to support his family as well as to enjoy his work on a daily basis.  For him, his greatest difficulty is the amount of capital which many times is insufficient for growth, but he is working on it so that he can expand his horizons.  <p>\r\nThe reasons for his efforts are his family and the responsibility he has to care for it as a good father and provider.  <p>\r\nJoel asks for a loan because he wants to be able to outfit his shop with wood, paint and varnish which are all indispensable supplies for his work.

They include: a 31 year old married man, a 27 year old woman, a 28 year old man, and a 22 year old man. Her husband works at an industrial workshop. Her goal is to maintain this source of income because it is his only means of work and she would not like to lose it until they have fulfilled all of the needs of their children. Her dream is for her children to always stay united and that each of them will help each other in difficult situations. She has taught them to be humble and generous. Her desire is for her products to be exported, which will prove the high quality of her products and earn more income for her family. \r\n\r\nOrbelinda's job is at a sewing shop in which the nature of the business is traveling. She has had the business for 37 years. Orbelinda started this business to earn income for her family because she had the responsibility to provide her children with education, shelter, and clothes; she began to work in this trade by selling various items of clothing: skirts, shirts, and shorts. Accordingly, she began to gain experience and a clientele. Later, she decided to increase her business by receiving help from Fundacion Leon 2000 and other friendly organizations. She obtained a loan to carry out her proposals and later decided to buy sewing machines to increase the production. However, she needed more help and with this, she realized she needed more financial aid. She will use the loan to purchase basic materials to make skirts, dresses, and other clothes so that she can travel to Managua where she can find more sales. She appreciates these friendly organizations and la fundacion Leon 2000 for helping her family achieve their goals. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Brittany Thatcher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":260621,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Investment capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-26T07:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orbelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":2333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2351.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400008},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":2333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2351.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092006},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":2333.34,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2351.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985389}],"funded_date":"2009-01-26T10:04:29Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Thatcher","image":null}},{"id":89670,"name":"Parveen M.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. \r\n<p>\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":304230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

With 3500 soles loan she can cover the cost of production for each order, as well, she cancel the order for the new sewing machine.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jenson Abraham, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":323201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials and cancel the order of a new sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-25T15:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":233.02},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":249.46},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":254.63},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":267.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":273.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":286.03},{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":296.04},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":302.51},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":318.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":329.35},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":340.49},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":349.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.23},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.48},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.82},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.02},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.95},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.57},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.77,"local_amount":237.61,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":241.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990589},{"amount":82.21,"local_amount":244.87,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":248.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211700},{"amount":85.48,"local_amount":254.63,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:54Z","rounded_local_amount":258.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641221},{"amount":89.67,"local_amount":267.11,"processed_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:30:20Z","rounded_local_amount":271.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080662},{"amount":91.82,"local_amount":273.5,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":277.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996795},{"amount":96.02,"local_amount":286.03,"processed_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":290.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842175},{"amount":428.95,"local_amount":1277.72,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1297.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733857},{"amount":103.82,"local_amount":309.25,"processed_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":314.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717151},{"amount":117.26,"local_amount":349.28,"processed_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":354.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144750966}],"funded_date":"2009-05-25T17:43:45Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jenson Abraham","image":206726}},{"id":114246,"name":"Betty","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Betty tiene 32 a\u00f1os, vive con su pareja en su casa propia, es madre de una peque\u00f1a de un a\u00f1o a quien le dedica toda su atenci\u00f3n y cuidados.

She is the mother of a little one-year-old girl to whom she devotes all of her attention and care.  Planting, cultivating and selling plantains and coffee are the everyday activities that Betty has performed for more than three years in the fields that her parents and step-parents have loaned her until she can obtain her own.  When she was young, she thought she would go into clothing sales, but she fell in love with farming and her aspirations changed because of the love she has for her husband, since she helps him with their agricultural chores, and over time she learned to love every one of her crops.  Now she and her husband are proposing to increase their production and generate enough profits to buy their own fields, but while they are accomplishing this, they are also trying to buy some land in the city where they can build a house with better amenities for their future children.  This is her fifth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA.  During her previous loan cycles she has shown herself to be a client who is very punctual in her payments, and one who participates in the activities and fulfills the agreements of her communal bank.  She has a lot of affection and gratitude for them because they have allowed her to continue working.  With the money provided she is going to take charge of cleaning up her plantain fields.

Four of her children go to school. She rents a three-room house, where she is staying with her children. Zaina takes care of additional family members (parents).  There is electricity but no piped water at her home. The family gets three meals a day. She resides in a semi-urban area in the outskirts of Kampala.\r\n\r\nZaina rents a stall in the Owino market, where she also purchases second-hand clothes. She sells to an average of 10 people a day.

Vumilia N. is an entrepreneur who produces a local drink known as \"Rutuku\". On the photo, she is the one raising her hand, with a little smile. An excellent client of the Sheria solidarity group (Sheria means laws, regulations), she is 50, a widow and mother of five children, four girls and a boy. The boy is the youngest and he attends 6th grade. The four girls have their own homes. A. lives in the village of Kiziba II, a shantytown on the outskirts of Goma, a commune of Nyiragongo. Her husband died in 2006 after a lengthy battle against diabetes. \r\n\r\nRutuku is basically an alcoholic beverage about 47% proof, brewed from a mixture of fermented cassava flour, maize, sorghum, etc. It is heated to more than 180C in a vessel connected to a locally-designed chimney pipe. The droplets resulting from the evaporation process are collected in a bowl and cooled to achieve the taste of strong Whiskey liquor, which the customers enjoy. \r\n \r\nA. started her business with her own money, an initial capital of $20. Soon after, she found out about the Hekima MFI and received her first loan of $50 to strengthen her business. With a new loan from the Hekima MFI, A. hopes to increase her sales by buying two bags of maize, two bags of cassava flour, about ten stacks of firewood, etc. \r\n\r\nA. has explained that the main challenges of producing the local beverage Rutuku are the sales on credit and the lack or scarcity of firewood, especially now that the state has already taken steps to impose criminal sanctions on anyone who harms the environment (people selling wood from the national park). Moreover, when the mixture of ingredients doesn\u2019t dissolve properly, the customers don\u2019t like the beverage and are reluctant to buy it. \r\n\r\nGiven her advancing age and the harsh conditions surrounding the production of the beverage, A. wants to make changes to her activities by adding a new business selling clothes and various items from Kampala, Uganda. She also plans to build a comfortable house on her plot. \r\n\r\nA. is grateful for the loans that the Hekima MFI grants her without any material guarantees because these funds allow her to support herself and provide for the needs of her children and grandsons. She recognizes the Hekima MFI as the local bank dedicated to helping the poor and the widows. \r\n\r\nThe Sheria group consists of 17 female members. All members are wearing a uniform in solidarity and unity to commemorate the International Women\u2019s Day of March 8, 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":565751,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase two bags of maize, two bags of cassava flour, about ten stacks of firewood, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Palaka Sur, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental.  She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  general store, recycling materials and pig fattening businesses.  Her husband Rolando G., who is 50 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are 11 to 30 years old. \r\n\r\nMercy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mercy  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus lifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 21st cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use to buy stocks for the general store and rice to sell so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Mercy  G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Imelda D. L. S., 45, proves this to be true in her life. As a CCT* Community Partner, she makes her business everything but stagnant. She is married to Jose, a van controller. Together they live in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nImelda owns a sari-sari (variety) store, where she sells merchandise essential to busy people in her community. There are times when her neighbors are too busy to go to the market or grocery store to purchase their needs. Coming to the rescue, Imelda provides them with what they immediately need such as a bottle of vinegar for cooking, a sachet of shampoo, or a bottle of cold soft drink to quench their thirst. Other than the sari-sari store, Imelda also buys and sells bananas, a favorite fruit of Filipinos, and operates a water refilling station. Being twenty years in business, she earns around Php 750\/day.\r\n \r\nTo help her continue the operation of her growing business, she would like to apply for a Php 29,000 loan. She plans to use this money to boost her banana buying and selling business. She will also invest the money in her sari-sari store to further meet the varying needs of her community. She believes that her entrepreneurial skills are being honed and her businesses are becoming more profitable.\r\n\r\nThere are problems Imelda faces at present, but she considers none of them worth emphasizing. She believes that these are twists and turns in her life that make it more interesting. She is praying for an increased capacity to earn in order to be able to make her business flourish.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":696753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Se\u00f1ora Veronica indicates that this is the first year that she has started a communal association in Pro Mujer, entering at the invitation of an advisor.  Currently she has a blanket weaving business, that she has been working for several years.  She learned her position from her friends.  \r\n\r\nThe loan that is requested now is for the increase of capital to pay for the purchase of wool that she bought at the market on July 16 and that she will later sell in her position at the market.  This form of work permits her to generate resources to support her family.  She is married and has four children.  \r\n\r\nWhen she is asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the meetings.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":871594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2011-09-19T00:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emiliana\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":8787.88,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":878.86},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":878.86},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":878.86},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":878.86},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":878.86},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":878.86},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":878.86},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":878.86},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":878.86},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":878.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.51},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.51},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.51},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.51},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.51},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.51},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.51},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.51},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.51},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":255.02,"local_amount":1757.72,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1774.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238694304},{"amount":255.02,"local_amount":1757.72,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1774.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244650339},{"amount":255.02,"local_amount":1757.72,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:15:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1774.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250867335},{"amount":255.02,"local_amount":1757.72,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1774.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257277080},{"amount":254.92,"local_amount":1757,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1774.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263418009}],"funded_date":"2011-09-19T04:15:07Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:52:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"B Brown","image":120650}},{"id":340482,"name":"Rosa Etelvina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He wishes to one day have his own minibus and to manage it himself.  He believes the most difficult part of his work is to stay seated every day while driving, leaving behind the things he would like to do.  Even so, he continues working every day without rest, in hopes of realizing his goals.  He is ready to do everything possible to achieve his goals.  This is Richar's second loan with MFP, and he knows that he has to pay all of his installments on time.  In his community bank, he is very responsible.  Since he is one of the few males, he does not want to look bad in front of the rest of his partners.  The one-thousand five-hundred nuevos soles that he is asking for will support them [Richard and his friend] in fixing the minibus in which they work in order to offer a better service to their clients.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Anne Rodriguez, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":323252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To repair the minibus that he uses for work ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-26T02:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":252.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596316},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":252.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990603},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":252.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211714},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:25:55Z","rounded_local_amount":252.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641235},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":252.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080676},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":252.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996809}],"funded_date":"2009-05-26T03:52:07Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anne Rodriguez","image":null}},{"id":114262,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nancy has been a taxi driver for 5 years, since a friend suggested the idea to her.

She is grateful to the Manuela Ramos Movement for helping her launch her business, and for helping so many women who wish to grow as entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":441840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase sewing supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina Del Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118439},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":251.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954190},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":251.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987202},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":251.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713250},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":251.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746411}],"funded_date":"2010-01-03T01:06:17Z","paid_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":163688,"name":"Niger Armando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Niger Armando T.

For the most part, the members sell fruit, humita (a type of corn cake), French fries, clothing, linens, but some of them paint (houses, rooms, etc.), make clothes, and repair bicycles.\n\nViviana is president of this communal bank, and in the photo is in the last row to the left, wearing a brown t-shirt.  She makes and alters garments and household furnishings.  She will use this loan for fabric, thread, needles, and sewing-machine oil, to make furnishings, for example, bathroom sets and curtains.  Her dream is to have a business in the center of town, motivated by the wish to cover the cost of studies in social work, which she will begin this year.  Viviana has found her work with Fondo Esperanza to be significant, for its business education and team work have benefited her in her personal development.\n\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucania region.

She will take care of her child and help her husband sell their fish to people in their village, or in the market if the volume is large. To attain this goal, she joined ASHI and is now requesting a loan which will be used to purchase the fishing boat. Once their child has grown, Mary Jane would like to start her own business.

Cercio has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan went to repair his motorcycle used in the business. Cercio is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase a set of tires to continually provide service. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Cercio from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is Nenita G., 50, who lives in Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Ediom G. and they have five children ranging from a college whiz to an elementary-school youngster. By the grace of God, Nenita has managed to support her older child's college education. She is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college. A dream for most Filipino parents like Nenita is a college education, as she herself has. She believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nNenita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Juanita's profit comes from buying supplies wholesale and selling in piece rate. Aside from the usual products, Nenita also managed to incorporate meats and cooked food, like her popular lunch and dinner fare, into her business. Commuters, students, and people who don't cook at home, flock to her store to buy adobo (soy chicken or pork), menudo (liver and pork cutlets in a rich tomato sauce with carrots and potatoes), sisig (liver, ear, and other face meat of a pig, grilled then chopped and tossed in vinegar, chili and a little mayonnaise). Nenita\u2019s store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a minimum of Php3500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nNenita is requesting a Php18,000 loan to buy more groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her inventory. She also will invest some of the loan to buy raw ingredients for her lunch and dinner fare. She expects to boost her income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nNenita dreams of being able to give her children a high-quality education through all her hard work. She also hopes to have her own stall where she could sell her products someday.

Her least favorite part is having to walk long distances to sell the product. She knows she has to work hard and one day be able to open a more stable business.

She has one son who is 15 years old and is completing school.   Her husband works as driver.  They would like to come up with new ideas to increase their sales and expand their customer base. They would like to increase their inventory so that they have products in reserve, as well as offer a greater variety to their customers.   They have always worked hard and want to make sure that their son knows how to run a business so that he can also provide income for his own family one day.   They hope that the support they receive from other countries will continue, as these are the source of investment for small businesses and the families they support.  \r\n\r\n Their particular business is a general store, which they've run for 5 years now.   Sandra began the business to help cover the household costs, selling a few products to her neighbors in the surrounding area.   Later on, she had the opportunity to sell her products from a fixed location in the candelaria market.

She is a dentist. It is quite ironic, that, being surrounded by men (her husband and two sons), she is sole breadwinner for her family as her husband is temporarily unemployed and her two sons are a college student and a high school student respectively.  <P>\r\n\r\nAfter she graduated from medical academy, Ainura started working and began saving her earnings. In the process of gaining experience, she already had a firm determination to open her own office. It took her many years of hard work, perseverance and patience until she was able to save US$ 1500. At last she accomplished that and opened a dental office and even bought necessary appliances and equipment. <P>\r\n\r\nSo, for three years, she has been her own boss. Now she makes US$ 500 a month. Since any loan is a quick access to get what you need, Ainura has decided to get a loan to buy photo-filling equipment.  Ainura has some far-reaching plans for making her dental room one of the best in the local area by creating service system for clients and buying high quality materials for dental treatment. <P>\r\n\r\nAinura\u2019s partners are: Dilbarbyu, Syinat and Nargiza. Dilbarbyu, 47, is divorced. Her three daughters and son being married live separately and little daughter goes to school. To make a living she sells cigarettes, mineral water and apples. Dilbarbyu needs a loan to purchase more goods and increase her turnover. <P>\r\n  \r\nSyinat, a widow of 44, has two daughters. She has her own office\/shop, where she provides minor services: opening foreign pages, loading units for cell phones, Xerox. Syinat needs a loan to buy a computer. She wants to provide typing and other computer services. <P>\r\n\r\nNargiza, 23, is married, a mother of one child. She raises sheep and sells milk. Her husband is an odd-job worker on a construction site. Nargiza hopes to get a loan to buy a milch cow. She wants to earn more money from selling milk to save it for building a new shed. <P>\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<P>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Ayungon, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. She is a 59-year-old widow with eight adult children whose ages range from 18 to 37 years old. Some of her children have their own families and seven of them have already graduated from college. Only one child is still studying. \r\n\r\nCandelaria has single-handedly taken care of the parenting responsibilities for all her children and is content with what she has accomplished so far. Her goal now is to have her youngest child graduate and start his own life armed with a good education and the ability to earn his own livelihood and provide for his future family.\r\n\r\nWhen her husband died, she could not imagine how she could support her children by herself. With the help of her older children, they started to adjust to a single-parent family. In 2002, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could borrow additional capital that could help sustain her general store and provide a steady income for her family. As her general store business stabilized, Candelaria knew that she needed to diversify her business if she wanted to prevent her family from falling into poverty. She slowly set aside some of her profits to start a food-vending business. Because she was so busy taking care of the living, she also recovered from mourning her loss. As her ventures improved she started to look for more opportunities where she could earn money without too much effort, and this is why she invested in pig fattening, which became part of the chores of her younger kids.\r\n\r\nHer business ventures now earn a monthly income of 3,360 Philippine pesos and she is able to support the college education of her children and sustain the needs of her smaller household, now that most of the older children live away from home.\r\n\r\nCandelaria is a member in good standing. She has consistently paid off her loans, which is why she was able to borrow PHP 19,500 for her previous loan, her 13th with NWTF-Project Dungganon. She also paid it off on time without any delays in the weekly installments and now plans to borrow another PHP 19,500 so that she could sustain the stock level of her businesses. She is thankful that NWTF-PD entered her life and allowed her to survive the tragedy of the death of her husband, and continues to support her in achieving her dreams for her children: to have a life that has dignity and opportunities for the future.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":402541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virgilia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 6,000 helped her increase her monthly profit to PHP 6,000, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase more dried fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for her future security. \r\n\r\nVirgilia aims to build a new house and buy a motorcycle when she has enough savings. Virgilia V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

children.  She, together with her children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n                            \r\nLeticia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also retails electronic cell phone loads for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeticia hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and  draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has a workshop with 2 machines, and lives with her husband and children who also dedicate themselves to this craft.  They have three employees and have been running the business from their house, in the town of Nimasac, Totonicap\u00e1n, Guatemala, for twelve years.  Currently, they find that customer demand has gone up but they don\u2019t have the financial resources to augment their working capital.  For this reason, they turned to the ASDIR Association to request a loan with the intention of using it to purchase raw materials.  This would allow them to increase their sales and, they hope, help them support their daughter and afford them all a better standard of living.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn

She has been selling tamales for several years.  Because this business went very well for her, she finished building her house and can educate her children.  \r\n\r\nBut, the constant rains last winter caused erosion, which cause landslides that damaged the area where her wood stove was.  Since then she does not make tamales.  She chose to sell \u201cbu\u00f1uelos\u201d (fritters).  She charges one PEN per portion.\r\n\r\nVilma likes her work.  At six in the evening she is at the side of the Paucartambo bridge until nine or ten at night.  It is an area which is heavily traveled by her neighbors and residents of nearby zones.  Vilma  brightens up her sales with her good character, which has allowed her to get many customers.  In three months she was able to make her business very profitable.  With these earnings she hopes to return to the space she had set up to sell tamales.  She would sell tamales in the morning, and in the afternoons she would continue to sell her bu\u00f1uelos with honey.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth consecutive loan working with MFP.  Vilma is very responsible with her payments; she does not like to make a late payment.  She encourages her colleagues in her Community Bank to not pay at the last minute.

She saves something every month at the Barclay's commercial bank.\r\n<p>\r\nShe received a previous loan from Novo Banco to purchase construction material and after finishing the loan she decided not to continue for various reasons. She learned about Hluvuku through a nearby friend who is also a client of the organization. With this first loan of 25,000 MZN from Hluvuku, she plans to buy construction material (tiles, doors and galvanized sheets) to finish her home.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe intends to pay back this loan promptly, in order to be able to receive further loans. She would like to apply for additional loans in the future to complete the work on her house. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by David Kaisel, Kiva

He is 46 years old. Ruben is married. Ruben owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, junk foods & beverages in the local community. Ruben has been engaged in his business for over six years and earns approximately 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Ruben joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to do business. Ruben has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Ruben is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods & junk foods. This loan will be the 15th loan taken out by Ruben from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

She lives with her husband and daughter in the La Libertad 2 housing community on the outskirts of Portoviejo.\r\n\r\nDelcita divides her time between the household chores and her business.  She has a store where she sells water, supplies, meat, fish, cleaning supplies, and personal use items.  She has been doing this for 12 years.  Her husband and her daughter help because her work schedule is from seven in the morning until eight at night.\r\n\r\nTo stock the products, Delcita buys wholesale in the market or from distributors who visit her store.  They supply everything she needs.  She says that she invests about 40 to 60 dollars a week to stock the store with the necessary items and get good earnings.\r\n\r\nThanks to the great help from the Espoir Foundation, she has been able to continue with her store.  She will use this loan to buy more products like rice and sugar by \u201cquintales\u201d (100 pounds).

Hadjah fries samosas and chapatti in Kawempe. She works in a semi-urban area, which is on the outskirts of Kampala.  She works seven days a week. She receives an average of 30 customers a day and sells to all categories of people at wholesale and retail.  Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding the family, school fees for her children and rent for her residence. Her major business challenges are transporting the baking flour, cooking oil and cowpeas to her business premises; seasonality, which makes her business difficult; and the rainy season, which disturbs her a lot because she works in an open area. Hadjah has been in this business for 10 years and with MCDT for five years. This is her 10th loan working with the same group mates. Hadjah joined MCDT because it was near her home and was working with poor women in the village. She wants to use this loan to buy more cartons of baking flour, jerry cans of cooking oil and a sack of cowpeas. She hopes to see her business grower bigger and to start employing three people."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":478394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is single and lives in a rented room in Peru's central jungle because he believes it is an area with more opportunities for work.\r\n\r\nHis parents raised him to work hard to reach his goals, so he decided to study what he loved most: music. He learned to play instruments such as the harp and piano. He is most often hired as a harpist, because there is higher demand and it is more profitable within the folklore market.\r\n\r\nOn the side, he transports people on his motorcycle. With the earnings from both activities, he is able to send some money home to his family. He is able to cover his personal expenses and is saving to buy more musical instruments because in the future he wants to have his own orchestra. On top of that, he want to sell home appliances.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP and he has demonstrated that he will make each payment on time to remain on good terms with his communal bank, which is composed of hard-working people brought together by their responsibility.

Her dream is to build her own house with concrete block and a roof.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she wanted to improve her business. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti.

A..  They reside in Jaranwala, which is a small city located in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Ever since her marriage, she has lived with her family in a three-room brick house. Her husband is a carpet-weaver by profession. She, meanwhile, is a housewife who does her household chores at home. She has given birth to five sons and a daughter. Her three oldest sons work in factories and receive meager incomes, while her three youngest children are receiving their education at a local school. <p>\r\n\r\nNasreen is now seeking a loan from a Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan proceeds, her husband would like to buy carpet-weaving raw materials such as thread, weaving tools, and sketches. Weaving carpets by hand is a very difficult task but A. does this job well, primarily because he knows that he needs to provide financial support for their family. Nasreen is hopeful that her husband will make good use of the loan proceeds and will be able to generate an increase in profits by weaving additional carpets. Notably, this would be her second loan from Asasah. With respect to the prior loan, she paid her installments on time and attended every meeting.

is a 59-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures: buying & selling herbal products, tricycle transportation and farming. She lives in Sta. Catalina, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Felisa is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Felisa aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They live in a sugar cane producing region.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that a few years ago she decided to set up her own business selling breakfasts, because she says that the economic situation is more and more difficult and she thinks that she should help her husband with the household expenses and the education of their children.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Yolanda tells us that her husband works in the sugar mill and that every day she sends him his lunch. Sometimes her husband shared his food with his fellow workers who did not have breakfast, and as they very much liked the dishes and the seasoning that she gave to the food, they began to pay Do\u00f1a Yolanda to send them breakfast. Since then, she has sold breakfasts and lunches to the employees of the sugar mill. She is very happy because, thanks to this, she earns a little extra money doing what she most likes to do -- cook.\r\n\r\nShe needs this loan to buy eggs, cheese, beans, rice, oranges, melons, bananas, meat, mole sauce, tortillas, plastic cups, and glasses to prepare her foods.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Yolanda hopes that with this loan she can in the future have a shop where she can set up her breakfast room and thus her business will grow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":861913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to prepare breakfasts to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-09-15T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1243.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807672},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1243.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618769},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1243.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573010},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1865.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784733},{"amount":50,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":621.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193380}],"funded_date":"2011-09-17T21:28:10Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":336442,"name":"Cristo Salva 1, 2 & 3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esperanza is the coordinator of the Cristo Salva Groups 1, 2 & 3.
