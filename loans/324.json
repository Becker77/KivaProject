A year later, with her uncle's help she was admitted to a teacher training program, where she met her husband. She works in the local schools as a Portuguese teacher. Her husband left her and remarried, but she didn't have economic difficulties because he sent her some money every month to help with the children. Luisa works from 6 a.m. to noon as a teacher, earning 2977 meticals a month, and in the afternoons as a an aide for the FRELIMO party, where she earns 3010 meticals a month. She is unable to save any money because in addition to her children, Luisa also takes care of her mother, sending her 500 meticals a month. She needs to make repairs on her house, since the doors were badly damaged by the constant rain that fell a few months back.\r\n\r\nThis is Luisa's third loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.

He lives in his own house with his three sons:  Yon, 17, Fredy, 15 and Luis, 10, who are the motivating force in his life.  Juan is a mototaxi driver.  This work supports his children.  He knows that he has a big responsibility with them for he has to see to their tranquility.  He is a cheerful person and always receives his passengers with a smile on his lips which makes him the preferred driver.  What he most enjoys about his work is chatting with his passengers which makes the long journeys much more pleasant.  He has been in this line of work for 3 years and considers the most difficult part of it is having to work until very late at night.  With time, he hopes to buy more mototaxis since his dream is to have a transportation business.  This is his third loan with MFP.  He has always been punctual with his repayments because he does not want to cause any problems for his communal bank in which he is a well-liked and active member.  With the 1000 new sol loan requested, he will buy a new mototaxi so that his son can operate it.  To accomplish this, he is willing to pay the difference with his own savings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":442747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To buy another vehicle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-07T00:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":167.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734882},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":167.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124206},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":167.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959945},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":167.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992792},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":167.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717581},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":165.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751256}],"funded_date":"2009-12-07T13:29:34Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":163832,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemma C. is from the village of San Vicente, Tambulig Zamboanga Del Sur.

She is 23 years old, married, and has three infant-aged children. To make a living, Madel owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily need products, such as bread for snacks, candies, shampoo, sugar and sachet coffee, in the local community. Madel has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Madel joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Madel is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

This will fetch her more profit and motivate her to go for her dream of owning a well-established bar and also enable her to sustain her family\u2019s needs.\n\nGrace belongs to a group who hold each other accountable and insure one another in paying back the loan because they want to access the future successfully.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":524259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more beers, wine and sodas for her bar business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyenjojo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-04-20T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clovis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Resty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cordelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adolf","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Innocent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":581.25,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1203199.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136733984},{"amount":528.7,"local_amount":1091500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1094410.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144767283},{"amount":592.39,"local_amount":1223000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1226260.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662301},{"amount":622.66,"local_amount":1285500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1288927.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689074}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T01:32:19Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":197202,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cI sold two hogs last December for 14,000 pesos \u201d, Rosa happily shares about her business.

They all live in the Valle de Chalco area of Colonia San Miguel, Mexico. This group was formed thanks to a mutual acquaintance who told them about FRAC, which they then decided to inquire about. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe, a member of the group Shalom, is 40 years old. She just finished high school and is a single mother with two children, 20 years old and 2 years old. Guadalupe has sold school supplies in a stationery shop for the past 6 years as she desires a better future for her family. She likes sales; it helps her attend to people. For her, it is very rewarding to have her own business. Everyday she opens early and closes late. There are days when the sales are not good, but even then she tries to come out ahead. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she wants to buy more articles, such as notebooks, coloring instruments, geometric games, erasers, pencil sharpeners and pencils, to have more merchandise at the stationery shop. Her plans are to finish fixing her house, giving her children an education and to have her own place so she no longer has to pay rent. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nAurora (Sale of shoes and bedspreads by catalog)                           \r\nJavier (Sale of construction materials)\r\nPatricia (Sale of bedspreads and comforters by catalog)                        \r\nSixto (Sale

He is single, and has one child aged three. In 2008, Sorie established a provisions and drinks business. He says \"I don't have to depend on anybody for assistance\" as he believes that his business is the only way for him to earn money to develop his family. Sorie opens his business throughout the week and spends about 11 hours working in his business every day. He is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 SLL to buy more provisions such as milk, sugar, sardines, margarine and drinks.

By starting the business he was able to earn income to sustain his family. He began in October of 1988, and has nearly 20 years of experience in this business. He first started driving a minivan on a fixed route, and later bought his own vehicle in order to work for himself. This was inconvenient because he had to rent the license plates, but fortunately he now has his own franchise and a new model car. Thanks to God the business has done well and Jorge likes his work because he gets to set his own schedule. Jorge's previous loan with Kiva helped him upgrade his taxi to make it safer because he could invest money in shock absorbers and tuning for better performance.\r\n\r\nJorge needs a loan of US$250, which he will use to improve the condition of his taxi so that it performs better and saves gas. He will repay the loan in 3 months.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":213220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Maintenance","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tampico, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22.216667 -97.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2008-10-17T11:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-31T11:31:11Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1090.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5279980},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-21T08:55:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1090.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9891769},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-24T08:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1090.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14814999}],"funded_date":"2008-10-17T11:31:11Z","paid_date":"2009-02-24T08:50:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Bishop","image":107465}},{"id":73462,"name":"Tho's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K.

With the 1500 nuevos soles she will buy more clothes so she can offer her clients a better variety to choose from. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":442805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-07T02:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":184}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.8},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.8},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.8},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.8},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.8},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.8},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.8},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":65.8,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":188.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734892},{"amount":65.8,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":188.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124216},{"amount":65.8,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":188.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959955},{"amount":65.8,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":188.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992802},{"amount":65.8,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":188.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717591},{"amount":65.8,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":188.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751266},{"amount":65.8,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:30Z","rounded_local_amount":188.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933804},{"amount":64.4,"local_amount":184,"processed_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":184.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672708}],"funded_date":"2009-12-07T19:31:24Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":163848,"name":"Ronnie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ronnie G. is from the village of Barangay Baresbes, Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya.

It was created in 2003 under the influence of a group of women who were part of a tontine (a system of rotating credit in which each member periodically contributes an agreed upon sum, and where each member is paid individually in turn). The members are inspired by the same objective, that is to develop solidarity and to improve their beloved quarter of les Parcelles Assainies.\r\n\r\nThe association is currently managed by Diall\u00e9 N., a very involved woman who knows group culture well.

This woman, 52 years old, has been an instructor in the national language, Wolof, in entrepreneurialism, and in decentralization since 1997.  In her free time, she devotes herself to business.  She sells fabric, shoes, creams, and more.  She does business, she says, to meet her needs and to increase revenue.  Moreover, with her portion of the loan, she will increase her stock of shoes and fabric to better develop her business.

To make a living, Daisy owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Daisy has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 3400 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Daisy joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Daisy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Daisy is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Daisy from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She has been working as a beautician for the past 13 years from her home. She offers all the beauty services to her customers such as make-up, pedicure manicure, tattoo, etc. Her income is very important for her family and to support her husband who is working out of Lebanon to earn the needed income for his family. Today, she is requesting to borrow $1200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase a tattoo machine instead of renting one. In the future, she would like to open a formal beauty salon for women. She is working to achieve even greater business success in the coming year.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

She is a woman who has always worked very hard to get ahead in life. She lives in her own home with her husband Fortunato, who is 67. What she wants the most is to have a calm old age. The activity Leoncia does is selling clothes in her stall located in the \u201cGamarrita D. la ciudad D. San Francisco\u201d market. Everyday she serves many buyers who know her good quality and the latest fashion of the clothing she brings from the city of Lima. They don't hesitate to buy large quantities of clothing. What she likes the most about her job is advising customers about the clothing that is in style in the capital. This way she earns their trust. She has been doing this for 48 years and she thinks that the hardest thing is staying at her stall for long hours, waiting for customers.  With time, she hopes to expand her stall to be able to offer customers more comfort. This is her fifth loan with MFP and she is saving to be able to make her payments on time since she doesn't want to cause trouble for the members of her communal bank, where she feels very happy. With the thousand soles she has asked for, she will buy more clothes in the city of Lima, to better outfit her sales stall.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":636723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more clothes in the city of Lima to better supply her business.

She is a hardworking young woman who is 21 years of age and the mother of a one-year-old daughter.  Connie has been living with the father of her daughter for a few years.  Her opportunities to study were limited, so she was not able to finish high school.  She and nine other ladies from the same community are looking to succeed, so they are seeking a loan as a way of achieving this goal.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is the first loan request submitted by \u201cBanco Mujer Las Luchadoras\u201d after learning about the services offered by Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, thanks to the efforts of Do\u00f1a Connie.  She was a member of another group that disbanded shortly after repaying its loan.  However, this did not stop her from starting a new group and she is very pleased with the women who have joined her.  \r\n<p>\r\nConnie\u2019s main business activity is raising poultry, specifically hens so that she can sell the eggs.  She also produces all types of handicrafts and household decorations as a side business to help generate additional household income.  Her loan will be invested in the purchase of hens, feed, and vitamins for her animals.  Connie has been in business for more than three years, but her main obstacle has been a lack of money to invest in her activities so that she can grow her business and improve the quality of her products.  Her goals and objectives are well-defined.  They include continuing her studies, having a larger business, and distributing her products throughout the community.  These are just some of the dreams that she hopes to achieve through hard work and dedication.\r\n<p>\r\nIn terms of impact, it is expected that the revenue generated from her microenterprise will help sustain her family financially and contribute toward the improvement of her community.

Es por esto que Olga In\u00e9s siempre trabaja con m\u00e1s esmero por sacar adelante a sus 3 hijos y brindarles la mejor educaci\u00f3n posible. Gracias a que sus comidas tienen una muy buena reputaci\u00f3n entre sus clientes, Olga In\u00e9s ha visto como su negocio ha venido incrementando sus ventas, por lo que requiere de la compra de m\u00e1s insumos para preparar m\u00e1s alimentos que les venda a sus clientes; sin embargo, Olga In\u00e9s no dispone en el momento del capital necesario para la compra de insumos que requiere, por lo que aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le permita acceder a la compra de dichos insumos y su negocio siga incrementando sus ventas. Olga In\u00e9s aspira a que su negocio siga con la misma senda de crecimiento y que sus ingresos tambi\u00e9n se incrementen considerablemente, de modo que pueda mejorar su calidad de vida, la de su esposo y la de sus 3 hijos, a los que quiere brindarles la mejor educaci\u00f3n posible.","en":"Olga In\u00e9s has been characterized as a person who is very hardworking and dedicated to her 3 children and her husband.  For some time now, she has been working selling food, and thanks to this activity she has been able to generate the income she needs to support the household expenses.  Olga In\u00e9s had parents with limited resources, and so she had to face a lot of adversity in her life.  She doesn't want her children to have the same experience.  For this reason, Olga In\u00e9s has always worked hard to provide for her children and give them the best education she can. She has a good reputation with her customers, thanks to the good food that she sells.  Olga In\u00e9s has seen her sales increase, and so she needs to buy more supplies to make the food that she sells to her customers.  However, Olga In\u00e9s does not have the capital available at this time to buy the supplies that she needs.  For this reason, she has applied for a loan that will allow her to purchase these supplies so that she can continue to increase her sales.  Olga In\u00e9s wants her business to continue on this growth path so that her income can increase considerably, and so that she can improve the quality of her life and that of her husband and their 3

He is married with four children. He is a small entrepreneur who sells various kinds of foodstuffs such as: cookies, candies, soft drinks, juices, macaroni, detergents and many others in his grocery store which he built 10 years ago. Currently Abdukadir has about US$ 1000 in inventory. His monthly net profit is about US$ 300. <P>\r\n\r\nToday Abdukadir is requesting a loan of 3200 Somoni for the term of 12 months to increase his stock. He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once in a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. One of his dreams is that his children might progress by means of their studies, for which he is doing his very best. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business. <P>  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a single mother of her 13 year old daughter, who studies in a school in the neighborhood. Carmen O. has been selling clothes for the past six years. In the beginning it was difficult because she began with few clothes to sell and sold them by walking through the streets. She was tired of walking and hadn't sold much; it was very frustrating. But little by little she began to have clients, who she extends credit to until payday (for two weeks). Now she has many orders from women in the free trade zone and those who she gives credit to. She is also affiliated with Avon, where she buys from the catalog to her clients' tastes. They also give a loan that she has already profited from. When she collects the money, she is going to pay it back. With this financing she is going to buy clothes, shoes, and cosmetics to offer her clients and continue in her business. With these profits she wants to plaster the walls of her house so it looks nicer and she can give her daughter greater comfort. She is accomplishing this with the helping hand of Afodenic. She is pleased to be given this opportunity with her loans. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Fanning, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":424129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase clothes, shoes and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-10T23:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.69,"local_amount":633.86,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":655.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601755},{"amount":31.32,"local_amount":626.4,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:35Z","rounded_local_amount":648.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003198},{"amount":31.52,"local_amount":630.38,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":652.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841355},{"amount":31.55,"local_amount":630.97,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":652.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874269},{"amount":31.31,"local_amount":626.28,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":648.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604168},{"amount":31.38,"local_amount":627.59,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":649.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639632},{"amount":31.31,"local_amount":626.18,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":647.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821406},{"amount":29.92,"local_amount":598.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":619.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561420}],"funded_date":"2009-11-11T02:11:41Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Fanning","image":null}},{"id":155589,"name":"Legalo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Legalo P. is a 50-year-old woman living in the town of Papa Sataua 1.

He hadn't done so before because he lacked the capital to do so because his earnings are barely enough to pay for food and other expenses.  \r\n\r\nThanks to this help from the institution, he will be able to raise a wall between the bath and toilet and he will install a door and he will be able to enjoy the improvements.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":478616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy building materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-28T00:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Heliodoro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.23},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.63,"local_amount":452.65,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:05Z","rounded_local_amount":473.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874603},{"amount":21.81,"local_amount":436.42,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":456.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604465},{"amount":23.3,"local_amount":466.06,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":487.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639935},{"amount":22.62,"local_amount":452.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:29Z","rounded_local_amount":473.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821720},{"amount":22.22,"local_amount":444.31,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":464.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561729},{"amount":87.42,"local_amount":1748.18,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1827.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770653}],"funded_date":"2010-01-28T00:38:05Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":176352,"name":"Edwige","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"T.

She sells a variety of products, such as clothing and silver jewelry. She started this business towards the end of 1992, when she decided to share her life with her spouse and take care of her family, especially her children. When she was single, she had worked as a domestic servant for many years. Now that she has a family, she decided to change her life in order to fulfill her duties as a wife and mother, while at the same time support her family's amelioration. She started out by selling jeans, sweaters, and silver accessories. She has been in business for the last 17 years, during which time she has been able to strengthen her commercial activities. She has a fixed clientele and is well-known in her area for filling her orders quickly. For this reason, she is now requesting a 1,000.00 PEN loan, which will be invested in purchasing merchandise, especially the polo shirts her customers have requested. By investing in her business, her profits will increase because this is working capital that she can use to pay cash for her merchandise. This is her second loan since she started the business, and she has been able to expand her inventory and make a profit, offering her customers the merchandise they order at an optimal time. <p>\r\nAida S\u00e1nchez dreams of buying a house so that her family can live comfortably.

She is 48 years old and the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarilyn is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, she runs a general store, selling mainly dry goods in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately $90 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Marilyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional stock to sell. Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 5th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":563313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He grows large volumes of potatoes.  He now has 20 sacks in production for the harvest in May which will bring a good income.  He also sells lamb meat every Friday when he travels to Chanchamayo where he has a sales stall.  On Thursday and Sunday he sells meat at the market in Tarma.  \"I buy 15 animals at each fair and I travel constantly in the central forest, where a kilo of meat is in higher demand and commands a higher price.  I will earn approximately 30 PEN per animal\", he explains.  He also has an artisan craft stall in the district of Palca where he sells sheets, shawls, scarves, etc.  He believes selling meat is the most profitable business, so he wants to open more sales points in the city of San Ram\u00f3n and another two in Tarma, sometime in the future.  This is his 15th loan through MFP, where he is committed to paying back the loan on time as he has with previous ones.

Thi An is the owner of a general store. She is 45 years old and has been a member of the TYM Fund for 5 years. She has 6 children, 2 of whom are adults. Previously, her family's income came mainly from agriculture. After joining the Fund, she decided to invest in a general store. At first, she only had a small store with limited goods as she was new in the business. However, until now, she has expanded her store and added in a wide variety of goods to satisfy the local people's demand. Together with her family's income from agriculture, the income from the general store has improved her family's economy. This time, she would like to borrow 16,000,000VND (975USD) to invest in her general store.

Elvira is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Elvira from ASKI.

21-years old, is a daily worker in a bakery.

They live in an economically vulnerable situation and Fatmeh's status as a daily worker offers her limited revenues.\r\nShe is requesting a loan of  $300 to repay debts that she and her family owe four different persons, including money owed for food and plumbing. Fatmeh prefers to come to Al Majmoua to resolve her credit issues, because she wants to preserve her family's pride. She does not want the people of her community to look at her parents as if they are asking for charity. Fatmeh is part of a group loan with other women from the same village. They named their group \"Fatmeh\" because she was the one who had the idea of contacting our Institution. A group is usually constituted of self-chosen women, living in vulnerable conditions, mostly in rural areas. The group lending is based on incremental increase of loan amount and group solidarity to guarantee repayment. The strength of the group loan is that it encourages the collaboration approach in the borrowing community. It is a very powerful tool towards economic empowerment of women."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":71943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To repay personal and family debts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Abbassieh - South","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2007-10-09T01:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatmeh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-23T02:59:21Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T10:29:13Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79978},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-12-11T10:28:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":95462},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-01-11T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":113933},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-02-11T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":133489},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-03-11T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":155785},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-04-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":180057}],"funded_date":"2007-10-09T02:59:21Z","paid_date":"2008-04-11T09:13:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24335,"name":"Elisapeta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elisapeta\u2019s family has been engaged plantation work for some time now.

This is 37 year old Anitha S. from Mwanza. She is married with two children, between the ages of 5 and 9 years old. Anitha has been running a poultry business since 2002. Our client\u2019s business is Poultry\/kuku business. \r\nRaising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\nShe works at the business for 8 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by two employees. Anitha currently earns about 360USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to buy chicks and continue with poultry business. \r\nIn the future, she plans to expand her poultry business. \r\nAnitha thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Fotu is a 52-year-old woman living in the town of Auala.  She is married and has eight grown children.  To make a living, Sophie owns and operates a business planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables to sell.  Sophie has been engaged in this business for over a year and earns approximately $78 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sophie joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities.  Sophie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  That loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Sophie is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used again to purchase manure.  This will be her second loan from SPBD.  Sophie plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The official name of this borrowing group is 07.Hoang Thanh-Hoang Hoa (03.04.07.Hoang Hoa).\r\n\r\nThanh is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To make a living, Thanh owns & operates a business a food stall.

Thanh has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 4,500,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Thanh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Thanh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  She is now requesting a new loan of 5,000,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be the 7th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Thanh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  Luong T.

She also receives support from her husband as a driver. She\u2019s been in this business for almost a year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009 Bernadita joined PMPC to gain access to its financial services. She is an active member of PMPC under the PDP-LP program, a microfinance program that reaches out to rural communities. Bernadita successfully repaid a loan amount of 7,000 PHP. She is now requesting a loan, her third from PMPC, of 14,000 PHP to be used for additional capital to buy and sell pigs for butchering. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family, in particular to meet their basic needs, to save for the future, for loan repayments and for her children\u2019s education, insurance and possible expansion of her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Her greatest achievement is being independent and generating her own income.  She tells us that her biggest difficulty has been having a child with an ear infirmity which requires costly treatment.  For this reason, what the father earns is not enough for all the expenses, and she started to work a year ago selling food and beverages as well as providing photocopy and printing services.  She has managed to bid on a cafeteria lease within a school, the parochial school Santa Rosa de Viterbo.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Delsy also owns a mototaxi that she rents out to drivers as a form of transportation.  In the future Delsy plans on obtaining enough capital to buy a car and rent it out as a taxi.

This loan will be used for the purchase of more fabric for assembly-line style production during times of demand. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cyrus Maher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":332974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2009-06-10T16:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giovanna Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":411.2},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":419.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":427.4},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":435.74},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":452.92},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":461.76},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":470.77},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":479.95},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":489.32},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":498.87},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":508.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.81},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.98},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.88},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.48},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.81},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":117.76,"local_amount":809.61,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":827.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52950250},{"amount":126.55,"local_amount":870,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T12:56:38Z","rounded_local_amount":889.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63167188},{"amount":131.31,"local_amount":902.78,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":923.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73592634},{"amount":136.26,"local_amount":936.8,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T15:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":957.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87028006},{"amount":141.39,"local_amount":972.09,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T19:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":994.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939977},{"amount":72.76,"local_amount":500.12,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":511.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103781078},{"amount":73.97,"local_amount":508.6,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":520.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103781079}],"funded_date":"2009-06-12T03:17:23Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:14:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cyrus Maher","image":null}},{"id":118582,"name":"Fagbohun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"F. sells wine, drinks and juice in her shop.

It is for this reason that Alice is seeking a loan to strengthen her working capital.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":393227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy bags of charcoal for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-09-23T20:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.34,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96896259},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735839},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623350},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118020055},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858548},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136618699},{"amount":29.66,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":13278.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.34,"payment_id":144652743},{"amount":20,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":8852.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151834817},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575372},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T07:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166953664}],"funded_date":"2009-09-24T03:10:23Z","paid_date":"2010-09-16T07:56:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":143234,"name":"Nov","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nov P., 37, is married and lives with her husband and two of her children in Takeo Province.

All her children go to school. She rents a one-room house where she lives with five people. Kasifa takes care of additional family members. The family has access to electricity and gets three meals a day, but has no piped water. She incurs transportation costs to and from shopping in Kikuubo, one of the busiest places in Kampala city. \r\n<p>\r\nKasifa has a retail shop in Natete and sells all types of goods like salt, sugar, flour and soap. She pays rent of about $27 a month for her business premises and about $16 a month for her residence. She works in a semi-urban area which is on the outskirts of Kampala. She works seven days a week. She receives an average of twenty customers a day and sells to all categories of people.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer largest monthly expenses include feeding the family, school fees for her children and monthly rent for her business and her residence. Her major business challenges are seasonality and the rainy season which hinders her customers from reaching her.\r\n<p>\r\nKasifa has been in this business for four years and with MCDT for five years, now servicing her 10th loan and working with the same group mates. Kasifa joined MCDT because it was near her home and it was working with poor women. She wants to use this loan to buy more merchandise, like bags of sugar, cartons of salt and boxes of soap. She wants to see her business grow bigger and would like to start selling on a wholesale basis only.
