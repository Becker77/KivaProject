She owns a business venture, selling food products in the local community.  Malia has 4 years of experience in this business.  Malia needs a loan of WST $1650 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nMalia joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Malia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Malia E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Joel has been engaged in his business for over 15 years and earns approximately 15000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Joel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Joel is requesting a new loan of 30000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Joel from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n-Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater \"jeepney\", open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

An additional loan will help Utuagiagi obtain the necessary supplies and repairs to continue to support herself via her fishing production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":26317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Fund continued growth of her fishing business by purchasing necessary repairs and supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"WS","country":"Samoa","town":"Manono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.833333 -172.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":15,"posted_date":"2007-04-13T00:57:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Utuagiagi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-27T17:54:28Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T09:15:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19426},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-07-02T09:16:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":28095},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-08-02T09:16:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":37935},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-09-02T09:17:13Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":49350},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-10-02T09:17:05Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":61574},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-11-02T10:17:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":75050},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-12-02T10:17:26Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":89822},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T10:16:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106278},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-02-02T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":126429},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-03-02T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":147049},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-04-02T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":171277},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-05-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":198470}],"funded_date":"2007-04-13T17:54:28Z","paid_date":"2008-05-02T09:02:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12466,"name":"Protus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Protus is married with 2 children, who are still in primary school.

Dengan mulai berjualan dari jam 07.00 pagi hingga jam 09.00 malam dengan menjual berbagai kebutuhan pokok serta makanan dan minuman. Modal awal yang dipakai Komang untuk memulai usahanya ini sekitar Rp.1000.000,- dan memang dirasakan sangat kurang karena barang-barang dagangan yang dijual hanya berkisar itu-itu saja. Untuk meningkatkan hasil dari usahanya ini sehingga paling tidak mampu membantu suami yang hanya sebagai petani akhirnya Komang bertekad untuk menambah modal usahanya dengan meminjam ke DINARI melalui program Tempek. Pinjaman dengan jangka waktu 12 bulan dan pembayaran cicilan setiap bulan ini akan dipakai untuk menambah omset barang dagangan yang akan dikembangkannya kearah penjualan barang-barang pokok kebutuhan dapur. Para pelanggan pun bertambah karena semakin lengkapnya barang dagangan di warung Komang Suarmi. Keuntungan bersih yang diperoleh setiap bulannya hampir Rp.300.000,- dan hal ini sangat membantu Komang dan suaminya dalam memenuhi kebutuhan sehari-hari serta menyekolahkan anaknya di bangku SD disamping juga memenuhi kebutuhan anak keduanya yang masih bayi. Kerjasama dengan DINARI meskipun baru pertama kali tetapi dirasakan sangat membantu meningkatkan taraf kehidupan dari Komang Suarmi.","en":"It has almost been 10 years since Komang Suarmi running her small grocery store in her house. She sells various goods, food and beverages, and opens the store at 7.00 am until 9.00 pm. The initial capital outlaid for the business was Rp 1,000,000. Komang Suarmi realizes that there should be more amounts deployed, so that goods sold can be more in number and varieties, but it was all they had.\r\n\r\nTo improve her grocery store that will help her husband who is only a farmer in fulfilling their daily needs, Komang propose to earn loan from DINARI through Tempek Program. Komang will use the 12 months loan with monthly installment to increase the number and the variety of goods sold, especially the variety of seasonings and kitchen materials. Komang is sure that the more variety her grocery store provides, the more customer will shop, and the more she will earn.\r\n\r\nKomang is able to earn Rp 300,000 a month from the store. The income is really usefull, especially to help her husband to fulfill their family daily needs and to fund their child\u2019s tuition fee, as well as to raise their toddler. The first cooperation with DINARI will be very helpful to Komang Suarmi and her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Hestyana Dyah Kuntari, Kiva

She owns a art business venture.  Tina has many years of experience in this business.  Tina needs a loan of WST $1700.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nTina joined SPBD.This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tina S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 41 and married with 8 children.  She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Afiafiese has 4 years of experience in this business.  Afiafiese needs a loan of WST $2450 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nAfiafi wishes to keep her business development on going as she requests for another fund to support and assist her family financially.  Afiafiese joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Afiafiese's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is married to a trader and has four children, aged 25, 18,15 and 10 years respectively; all are school-going children. She has one additional dependent, who lives with her because she is a foster child.   \r\n\r\nIn 1991, Fatmata established her cola-nuts, palm oil, pepper and groundnut business. She began her business because she was unprivileged to attend school and her father forced her into early marriage at the age of 15 years to a businessman. They did business together for some years but later her husband gave her some money to establish her own business, which has grown over the years from a stall to a shop.  \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about 1,066,000 Sierra Leone leones (Le) every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.   \r\n\r\nFatmata has already received and successfully repaid four loans, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase the following items: Cola-nuts - 10 bags @ Le400,00; and palm oil - 8 rubbers @ Le90,000. The balance will be used to pay laborers.  \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 160,000. In the future, Fatmata plans to build another house and have her own store. She also plans to provide a quality education for her children.  \r\n\r\nShe feels good in taking this loan as it will help her to earn more income. Her major challenge is that sometimes she can buy some items with a high cost from her suppliers but when she goes to sell them, there will be a fall in prices. Competition is high, but she overcomes her competitors by selling at a reduced cost. She serves 10 customers each day.   \r\n\r\nHer business is popular because she is honest and sells at a reduce price. Her suppliers are located in Bo Town and Sanda. She transports her supplies by public vehicle, and she buys three times per month. She adds her profit to the business. She is planning to expand her business and this will be accomplished by acquiring loans. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":926463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase the following items: cola-nuts - 10 bags @ Le400,00; and palm oil - 8 rubbers @ Le90,000.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-12-13T21:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721827},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124735},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505641},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974747},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815315},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:04:34Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444372},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:01:57Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537104},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284595},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338187},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354598}],"funded_date":"2011-12-14T01:55:44Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":365727,"name":"Sugran's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sugran (right) is 49, married, and lives with her family including five children.

They live in extended traditional families in the Dougoukoro neighborhood in the city of Yanfolila (one of the prefectures of the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nThey are linked by bonds of neighborhood and friendship. This groups specializes in selling Wax pagne (a highly prized cloth in Africa) and cereals. They've been partnering with the Soro Yiriwaso institution for two years now and are seeking their fourth solidarity loan (group loan). All previous loans have been repaid without problems. This loan will enable them to buy 40 pieces of Wax pagne from wholesalers in Bamako, as well as 100 kg of cereals from itinerant merchants coming from the surrounding villages.\r\nThe pagnes are then cut into \"trois pagnes\" (\"three pagnes\", i.e. the amount of fabric needed to make some woman outfits) and retailed for cash in the market and in the various neighborhoods in Yanfolila. The business results in a profit of XOF 1250 (ca US$ 2.40) per piece. The cereals are retailed to a mostly female clientele, for cash and on credit.\r\nThe members of the Benkadi group hope to make, each in their speciality, a monthly profit of XOF 50'000 (ca US$ 100) that thy intend to use to repay the loan and help their husbands in providing for the family. The women of this group have the ambition to open cereals shops to broaden their clientele.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":224515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy Wax pagnes (highly prized cloth) and cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Yanfolila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.183333 -8.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mari\u00e9tou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noukessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta Badjan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":175000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":683.33,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":352608.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974096},{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":176304.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889469},{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":176304.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440262},{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":176304.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135630},{"amount":341.66,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":176304.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033431}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T14:32:09Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Stadelmann","image":1374498}},{"id":78042,"name":"Maria Leonor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leonor B., tiene una venta de tortillas, ella tambi\u00e9n vende c\u00f3males para caber tortillas, y los vende en diferentes lugares, tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la venta ropa t\u00edpica  de mujer.

Though the decision she made then allowed her see the happiness that life can offer, she doesn't like to be dependent on anyone, even on her new partner, Anastacio, who is a brother of her former husband, because she knows that she has children of her own to raise and send to school.<P>\r\n\r\nHer membership in ASHI and the loans she has accessed since she became a member have assisted her in running a  business while Anastacio is a laborer and farmer. He is also very supportive of Zenia and his step-children, as well as their own nine-year-old child. Because of this, Zenia has been performing very well in her repayment, attendance, and business thus making her qualified for a higher loan amount.<P>\r\n\r\nZenia's recently received loan was intended as additional capital for her farming (rice planting) business and hog fattening (backyard pig raising) with pigs to be sold after four months. She will also finance her store to be re-opened. Zenia has to have many business to generate bigger income to send all six of her children to school. All in all she has seven children, however, her eldest works as an overseas contract worker and is also helping her finance the education of the siblings.

She lives with her two children in a house she owns.\r\n\r\nFor 2 years, she has made a living selling prepared meals at one of the best-known markets in her neighborhood.  She is an excellent cook and serves up a variety of tasty dishes.  She works from very early in the morning until everyone finishes their lunch at 2 or 3 in the afternoon.  She then goes home to her household chores.  Rogelia is happy with her business because she likes to cook.  She doesn't think it's an easy job, though, because she has to be very careful about how she prepares her dishes and, at times, the rush of customers is more than she can handle.  For the future, she wants to improve her food stand and buy better tables so that her customers will be more comfortable and able to talk to each other more easily.  \r\n\r\nThis is Rogelia's second MFP loan and she was very careful before to repay all the installments on time.

She lives with her husband, their two children, two grandchildren and the wife of one of their sons in Alajuelita, a region located in Costa Rica\u00b4s central valley. Angelita is an experienced client of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. Over the past 16 years, she has received numerous loans in various amounts to finance her sales business. Angelita plans to use the current loan to purchase clothes, shoes and perfumes, which she will sell to her clients in different parts of Costa Rica. The majority of her clients are women, though she offers products for men as well. Angelita does not drive; her main method of transportation is the public bus system.  \r\n\r\nIn the mornings, Angelita performs domestic tasks such as cooking, cleaning and overall house maintenance. After lunch, she heads out to either purchase new products, collect on repayments from clients she has sold to on credit or to sell her products. Twice per month, Angelita travels 3 hours by bus to an area named Guapiles to visit her clients. \r\n\r\nAngelita says that the apartment her family lives in is small for seven people.  At the moment, she is saving as much as she can so that one day, she might be able to buy a house in Alajuelita.  Angelita says her main problem is collecting money from some of her clients. She says she has to remind some of them that her products are \u00a8not a gift.\u00a8\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":515303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase clothing, shoes and perfumes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Alajuelita","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-03-27T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":16933.27},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":17328.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":17732.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":18146.47},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":18569.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":19003.19},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":19446.59},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":19900.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":20364.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":20839.87},{"due_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":21326.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21823.74},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":22332.96},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":22854.06},{"due_date":"2011-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":23397.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.04},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.51},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.27},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.05},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.48},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.34},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.2},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.1},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.01},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.95},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.89},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.94,"local_amount":34328.38,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":35288.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136678112},{"amount":69,"local_amount":37636.02,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":38688.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152047945},{"amount":418.06,"local_amount":228035.6,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":234415.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159763254}],"funded_date":"2010-04-01T00:20:43Z","paid_date":"2010-08-16T08:45:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":193605,"name":"Dionisia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dionisia K. is from the village of Del Pilar.

His wife is a trader, and all of their children attend school.  In 2000, Farrah established a furniture-making business.  He began his business at age 15, after his father died.  Without his father, there was no sponsorship for his schooling and because of this, Farrah's uncle advised his mother to send him to study at a carpentry workshop.\r\n\r\nNow Farrah makes beds, chairs, cupboards, dressing mirror, tables, benches, desks, and other items.  He works six days a week, 11 hours a day, and earns about Le 1,500,000 every month from his business. Farrah has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and plans to use the proceeds of this loan to buy raw materials to make beds, tables, and chairs.  Farrah says a major business challege for him is that some customers will not pay in full for items they order, leaving unpaid balances that are difficult to collect.

Her eldest child is in high school while the youngest is five years old. Ma. Shirley and Nestor have been running a buying and selling business for the last five years until the present time. They wish to grow this business to increase their income and so that they will be able to support the education of their children until college. They also wish to acquire their own space in the municipal market where they can display items they sell and gain more customers\/buyers. These dreams however will remain as vision forever if the couple's long time problem which is business capital is not addressed.\r\n<P>\r\nIn July of 2009, Ma. Shirley found the opportunity she and her husband were hoping for for many years. She knew ASHI and she felt that the institution fits her needs by offering a loan that suits to her capacity to pay. \r\n<P>\r\nAs a newly recognized member of ASHI and as a beginner, Ma. Shirley's maximum loan amount is still small. However, if she proves that her capacity to pay a larger loan is increased because she was able to grow her business further after her first loan, she can request bigger loans in future loan cycles.\r\n<P>\r\nMa. Shirley believes that the success of her family lies in the success of her business, and the success of her business lies on loans she can request, therefore she promised to herself and her family that she will use her loan to generate income.

Alesandra got married to Reynaldo, she raised pigs in their backyard. Over those years, hog fattening wasn't really a business for her yet it is just a sporadic livelihood activity. She had no source of capital then to sustain her grow the activity to become a business since she had no access to credit. Her husband's irregular income being a laborer is yet insufficient for the family daily exnpenses especially of her five children who range in age from one to 13 years now. \n\nAlesandra wanted ever since her livelihood to become a stable source of income or to say a business that is why, In 2004, she joined ASHI to be able to get a loan for a business capital. After loaning several times in ASHI, she had proven her pledge that as a member, she will try her best to use her loan in her business and that she will be able to repay on time. Now, Alesandra requests for a much bigger amount of loan for financing her livelihood activity that turned into a business for the past years. After four months of raising her pigs, she sells them in the market and she profits as much double of the amount of her capital. With large amount of capital, she can purchase more pigs to raise and sell thus making her profit more every four months.\n\nWith the profits she will be having in her business, Alesandra wanted to send all of her children to school until they graduate from college to be able to bring themselves out of poverty in the future.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to a man named Hector and they have two young children who live with them in their own home, which is located in a quite rural part of the central Peruvian jungle.  Her main motivation is her children, to whom she would like to provide everything she never had \u2013 for this reason, she opens the doors of her store at five o'clock in the morning every day, because it is at this early hour that her neighbors leave to work on their farms and other stores don't open until 6 AM.  This offers her a great advantage, gaining greater income with only a little extra sacrifice.  She doesn't mind it too much, either, because she enjoys serving and chatting with her clients.  She has also gotten used to this routine, since she has been running this business for over 4 years.  On the other hand, her husband works as a security guard in a mine, so he only comes home every three weeks.  Before he started this job, however, he left a few hectares of land ready to farm coffee and bananas.  \r\n\r\nHaydee would like to surprise her husband the next time he returns home, so she will fix a few of her house's problems with some wood and calamina (a mineral) to better prepare them for the harsh winter in their area.

items from her home to her neighbors. She hopes to build a permanent shop to sell her products in the future. Her primary business challenge is seasonality. \r\n\r\nShe decided to work with Yehu so she can access loans to boost her new business.

Guille, as she is known in her community, studied until her third year of primary school because her parents didn't have enough money to pay her school costs.  She says that her daughter, who is in high school, is teaching her to read and write so that she can study for a primary school certificate and improve herself.  \r\n\r\nGuille is asking for this loan to invest in her business that sells underwear, bathroom slippers, socks, earrings, hair bands, and women's accessories and makeup.  She used to sell fruits and vegetables but she didn't like that type of business because if all of the fruit is not sold, it will go bad and she would lose money.  For that reason, now she sells products that earn more money and don't go bad.  She buys some of her merchandise in M\u00e9xico and other parts in Zitacuaro Michoac\u00e1n.  She has had this business for two years, and she sells products at the flea market in her area and in the towns close to her.  She also works as a maid because she has to help her children and grandchildren get ahead.\r\n\r\nGuillermina is a single mother with nine children, but only four live with her.  Gerardo is 18 years old and stopped going to school after 6th grade, so he doesn't have a plan for the future and can't improve himself.  Yuriccia, 16, and Edwin, 14, are high school students.  Alfonso is 12 and is in primary school.  She also cares for three of her grandchildren.

degree in Aerospace Engineering and Theoretical Physics. Since then, Antonio has pursued his passion by starting his own business, Authentic Scale, dedicated to the manufacturing of engines for reduced scale models of planes. He sells the exact external replicas of old engines that went out of production 50 years ago. He has gathered a team of engineers and designers from all over the world who are experts in the field. \r\n\r\nThe first engine was manufactured and assembled in November 2010 and the first sale was made in January 2011. The business started manufacturing methanol engines, but as the price for methanol has significantly increased, Antonio and his team of engineers have decided to introduce a new line of gasoline engines. Gasoline is much cheaper and the engines cost less to manufacture than methanol engines. He is currently the only manufacturer offering these unique engine configurations which will start production in 2012.\r\n\r\nThe loan will give Antonio the capital he needs for production of the gasoline engines. For Antonio\u2019s next project, he hopes to pursue the production of full-size diesel marine outboard engines. The diesel boat engine will reduce the fuel burned per hour by at least 66%, compared to typical gasoline outboard engines.\r\nCheck out the Authentic Scale website for more

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and has restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":55276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of five cows, feed and veterinary supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Mlomp","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.828889 -16.5275","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2007-08-21T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-05T01:07:38Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:25:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79984},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:29:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93732},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T20:58:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136672},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-04-05T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":173870},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-05-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:45:13Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201088},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-06-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":228292},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-07-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:47:00Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257392},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-08-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286173},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-09-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-15T07:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":316404}],"funded_date":"2007-08-22T01:07:38Z","paid_date":"2008-09-15T07:16:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":20706,"name":"Raul","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Se\u00f1or Ra\u00fal Q. owns a house located in the area of Rio Seco in the city of El Alto.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":286531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He works as a clerk at the Pisis gas station from 7am until 4pm.  \n\nJuli\u00e1n and his wife have a family business in textile production.  He has already been working in the business for several years, and it is going very well thanks to the effort that he puts into his work.  Being a member of the Fundaci\u00f3n has helped him substantially to improve and make his business grow. With this new loan, he would like to buy alpaca wool and natural dyes - for example, cochinilla, a red plant-based dye - to make weavings. Juli\u00e1n\u2019s wish is to be able to open an artisanal shop where he can sell his products.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mairead Harris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":550389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of natural dyes and alpaca wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chinchero - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julian Edmundo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92.76},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":95.54},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98.41},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":101.36},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":104.4},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":107.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.76},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.41},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.4},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":188.48,"local_amount":188.48,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":188.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159590240},{"amount":98.51,"local_amount":98.51,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":98.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166800963},{"amount":101.46,"local_amount":101.46,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":101.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172070736},{"amount":104.51,"local_amount":104.51,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177362059},{"amount":107.04,"local_amount":107.04,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":107.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182497040}],"funded_date":"2010-07-03T06:51:34Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:04:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mairead Harris","image":500788}},{"id":210024,"name":"Yaneth Nathaly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yaneth Nathaly P.

She earns her living by operating a general store and a buy and sell of dry goods business. Her husband Michael, who is 31 years old, works as a company driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 3 and 7 years old. Rosario joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosario has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.

Her son is serving in the Armenian army; her daughter is a student of Yerevan State University, Ijevan branch. Alina\u2019s parents-in-law are retirees. \r\n\r\nSince 1994 Alina and her husband have been engaging in clothing sales.

Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Selling food is very lucrative and the only problem is when there is unsold food and Paulina does not recoup her investment. But on market days, she does well and even runs out of food. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Paulina's second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She will use the money to stock up on sweets and soft drinks for her restaurant. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kris Vickery, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":234696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To stock up on soft drinks and sweets for her restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-10T23:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":251.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957811},{"amount":243.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":753.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116548}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T18:23:06Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"k vickery","image":389145}},{"id":82186,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mary tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su conviviente y sus 4 hijos que estudian y la apoyan mucho.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Fortunately, the daily consumption needs of her family are met because of the carenderia. Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative is a big help to her family and business.

She lives in a rented room and has great desire to get ahead in life. For more than 5 years she has been selling second-hand hats.  She found this activity to be the best way to support her family economically.  She buys the used hats from suppliers to then repair them and on Sundays, in the markets of the city of Juliaca, she sells them as an ambulatory salesperson.  For Celia, the most fun part of her job is to sell as she enjoys convincing her customers to buy something and sell out of her merchandise.  In the future she hopes to have a clothing store where she can sell with greater comfort and provide better service to her customers.  What she likes least about her work is having to walk all day long through the streets in search of clients.  Celia knows that the path to her goals is difficult, but this does not decrease her eagerness to accomplish them.  This is her second loan with MFP and she feels very happy about this opportunity for a loan.  She hopes to be able to repay it on time and in her communal bank she is one of the most participatory and responsible members. With the loan that she is requesting she will buy more hats to increase the amount of merchandise that she sells.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":305643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase Merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-21T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:27Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012469},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:42Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596059},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990323},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211446},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640949},{"amount":33.35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080417}],"funded_date":"2009-04-21T20:08:59Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aimee Sostowski","image":null}},{"id":106762,"name":"Sanoussi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette dame est une veuve qui vit seule avec ses 03 enfants dans le quartier d\u2019amouti\u00e9v\u00e9, l\u2019activit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle exerce et qui lui permet de subvenir aux charges de sa famille est le commerce des articles de mercerie et la vente de boissons, ce commerce lui r\u00e9ussit bien. , elle exerce son commerce pr\u00e8s du march\u00e9 d\u2019amouti\u00e9v\u00e9.Elle veut commencer le commerce de produits cosm\u00e9tiques pour augmenter ses recettes et bien subvenir aux charges de sa famille, elle  a d\u00e9j\u00e0 obtenu un cr\u00e9dit qu\u2019elle a bien rembours\u00e9 et sollicite de WAGES son deuxi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit afin d\u2019acheter des produits cosm\u00e9tiques.","en":"This lady is a widow who lives alone with her three children in the Amouti\u00e9v\u00e9 district.

She is 48-years-old. Angeles is married and has four school-age children. To make a living, Angeles owns and operates an \"alimango\" fishing retail business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling seafood products including fish and shrimp in the local community. Angeles has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Angeles joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Angeles has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Angeles is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seafood to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Angeles from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for her children and to be used for daily needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

They are a couple who want to be well set-up before becoming parents, because they don't want their children to lack anything. For two years, Edgar has farmed coffee and bananas on his own farmlands, which he inherited from his mother-in-law. He also works as a labourer on the land of some landowners, earning about 20 soles per day. His wife does housework but helps him at harvest time. His favourite part of his job is clearing the weeds from his land and harvesting his fruits; on the other hand, it is difficult to keep his fields safe from pests which hurt productivity. But he knows that in agriculture, one always earns something useful, and thus he considers agriculture to be profitable and he wants to expand his farmlands to keep growing coffee.\r\nHe is sure that he will become the best coffee producer in the area and, in order for his wife to also have economic benefits he will install a food store or a clothing store in their house. This is the second time he has taken out a loan with MFP, and as he already knows how the community group works together, he is happy to keep working with such very responsible and honest people. With the requested loan, he will buy 7 bags of fertilizer, and wood, nails and corrugated iron to finish the construction of the second floor of their home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":550442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"7 bags of fertilizer and materials for home completion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-10T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1209.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588200}],"funded_date":"2010-06-10T13:03:49Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":210040,"name":"Yameena's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yameena H. is a resident of Raiwind which is located near Lahore, Pakistan.

The city suits everyone:  the broad choice of work, the shiny streets, the entertainment, and the promising prospects of great success.  Only a few youth risk remaining in their native villages and building a life there where others have long since lost hope.  The heroes of our story are some of those few people who have decided to remain and achieve success gradually. \r\n\r\nNurjamal I. is forty-six years old.  Nurjamal is the mother of three children.

Bliss, Bogo, Cebu. She earns her living buying and selling ready-to-wear clothing. Her husband, Danilo C., who is 40 years old, works as a company driver and also helps in his wife's business. They have four children between three and 19.  \r\n\r\nLiza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Liza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to expand her clothing inventory so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Liza C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.
