prendas de vestir, accesorios, papeler\u00eda y prodtos de drogueria etc. Su negocio inici\u00f3 cuando decidi\u00f3 generar ingresos para su hogar de alguna manera y fue apoyada por su esposo para lograrlo, as\u00ed fue como  inicialmente y de manera independiente,  empez\u00f3 vendiendo productos energ\u00e9ticos de varios laboratorios a sus vecinos y amigos, con el tiempo tambi\u00e9n

Su desafi\u00f3 es tener el suficiente capital de trabajo para comprar en mayor volumen y obtener  buenos descuentos por su compra de contado. En la actualidad vende de contado en el punto comercial,  pero tiene una cartera de clientes rentables que cada d\u00eda le recomiendan nuevos compradores y es necesario complacerlos. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, para comprar  especialmente ropa que tiene encargada. Mientras Shirley trabaja sigue fortaleciendo su negocio con sus esfuerzos y generando una rentabilidad no menor del 21%, una rotaci\u00f3n de inventarios de 10 d\u00edas y una rotaci\u00f3n de cuentas por cobrar de 15.\n","en":"Shirley lives in the city of Barranquilla with her \u200b\u200bhusband and 12 year old son.  She has a business which she runs from her general store located in her home, where she sells energy products and miscellaneous goods such as clothing, accessories, stationery, etc.  \r\n\r\nHer business began when she decided to somehow generate income for her household, and her husband supported her in it.  It was in this way that she initially and independently began selling energy products from several laboratories to neighbors and friends.  She eventually also added clothing, beauty products, and gradually all the other items that customers had requested that she didn't stock.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to add a number of freely available allopathic drugs to her energy products, because she wants to integrate a pharmacy line into her general store.  Her challenge is having enough working capital to buy in greater volume and to get good discounts for cash purchases. \r\n\r\nToday she sells items from her business locale for cash, but she has a roster of profitable customers who recommend new buyers to her on a daily basis, and it is necessary for her to keep them happy.  This is the reason that she is coming for a Kiva loan.  It is her first financing through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, specifically to buy clothing that has been ordered. \r\n\r\nWhile Shirley is working, she continues to strengthen her business through her efforts.  She generates a return of no less than 21%, an inventory turnover of 10 days and a turnover of accounts receivable of 15 days."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":840362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"specifically to buy clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-19T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shirley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":76052},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":81611},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83176},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":84770},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":86395},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":88050},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":89738},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91458},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":93211},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94998},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96818},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":103723}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.51},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.47},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.43},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.41},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.55},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.42,"local_amount":76052,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":78672.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803715},{"amount":47.67,"local_amount":81611,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":84423.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614793},{"amount":97.25,"local_amount":166486,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-20T08:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":172223.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568745},{"amount":0.85,"local_amount":1460,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1510.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780075},{"amount":50.47,"local_amount":86395,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":89372.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188467},{"amount":51.43,"local_amount":88050,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":91084.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324684},{"amount":52.41,"local_amount":89738,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:32:02Z","rounded_local_amount":92830.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038744},{"amount":53.43,"local_amount":91458,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":94609.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650908},{"amount":54.44,"local_amount":93211,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:54:48Z","rounded_local_amount":96423.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140514},{"amount":55.49,"local_amount":94998,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":98271.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100447},{"amount":117.14,"local_amount":200541,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":207452.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338080}],"funded_date":"2011-08-29T19:34:54Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":328495,"name":"Timothy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Timothy has been in mixed farming in Kitale, Western Kenya, for the last 5 years.

Maximo has been living in Baba his entire life. He has a primary education, and is a very hard worker. Through his farming he has been able to raise six children. He lives with his wife Marcia, a son and a daughter. They help him plant rice, plantains, bananas, and corn. He also raises some chickens, pigs, and cows. He hopes he can invest in a chicken coop so he can establish a business. He is optimistic about the loan because chicken sales provide a good secondary source of income in case of emergencies. With the extra profits he hopes to help pay for one of his grandchildren's university studies. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":25837,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Invest in a chicken coop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-12T06:16:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T20:00:12Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":950,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":159,"local_amount":159,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":159,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21412},{"amount":158,"local_amount":158,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T19:38:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":158,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31798},{"amount":158,"local_amount":158,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:13:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":158,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51883},{"amount":475,"local_amount":475,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T22:16:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107780}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T20:00:12Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T22:16:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12158,"name":"Jemiyyet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

Realizing the high profit gained, her family decided to renovate the pig sty to continue rearing pigs in a large scale. Since then, her family members have been putting more effort into work. Her husband also works as a construction worker with the monthly income of 2,000,000VND (125USD). Mrs. Ly sometimes works as cleaner for the village's administration house for the monthly income of 1,000,000VND (62.50USD). With these stable incomes, her family has always been able to repay the loan fully. This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to invest in rearing pigs.

hijos, hace unos meses viv\u00edan en la casa de sus suegros, pero ahora est\u00e1 muy feliz de mudarse a su casa propia. Desde muy ni\u00f1o le han gustado las labores agr\u00edcolas, cuando su padre alistaba las yuntas para arar sus chacras \u00e9l se emocionaba mucho, porque su reto era domar a los toros para arar cada una de las chacras. Ahora convertido en un hombre muy responsable, cada uno de sus cultivos los realiza con mucho cari\u00f1o y esmero. En a\u00f1os anteriores se dedicaba mayormente a la siembra de papa, pero por falta de presupuesto aminor\u00f3 la cantidad y ahora siembra m\u00e1s alverjas porque este cultivo le resulta m\u00e1s rentable. Adem\u00e1s, cuando tiene tiempo aprovecha en trabajar en los cultivos de sus vecinos, quienes le pagan de 18 a 20 soles diarios, con este dinero cubre los gastos de la canasta familiar, mientras que el dinero de las cosechas lo guarda para que vuelva a sembrar. Los sue\u00f1os de Juli\u00e1n son de mejorar su situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica e implementar su hogar con los art\u00edculos b\u00e1sicos necesarios. Juli\u00e1n es una persona callada en las reuniones de su banco comunal, quien siempre opina es su  esposa. Este es el 7mo pr\u00e9stamo consecutivo que viene trabajando con MFP, y en todo este tiempo no ca\u00eddo en morosidad. El dinero que ahora solicita es para la compra de fertilizantes para el abonado de su chacra de alverjas.","en":"Juli\u00e1n is 28 and has lived with his wife for 5 years.  They have 2 children together.  A few months ago, they lived in his inlaws' house, but now he is very happy to have moved to their own house.  Since he was very young, he has liked working in agriculture.  When his father prepared the oxen to plow his land, he got very excited because his job was to break in the bulls to plow each one of the plots of land.  Now he is a very responsible man, and he grows his crops with a lot of care.  In previous years, he mainly grew potatoes, but because they weren't very profitable, he lessened the quantity that he grew of them and now grows more peas because they are more profitable.  Also, when he has time, he helps his neighbors with their crops, and they pay him 18 to 20 PEN every day.  With this money, he can cover the cost of his family's food and he can put the money from his harvests towards the next season's planting.  Juli\u00e1n's dream is to improve his economic situation and to furnish his home with the basic necessary items.  Juli\u00e1n is quiet in his communal bank's meetings; his wife is the one who always voices her opinion.  This is his seventh consecutive loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  In all this time he has not defaulted.  The money that he is requesting will go towards buying fertilizer for his pea crop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":304959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-19T00:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juli\u00e1n","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":130,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:17:30Z","rounded_local_amount":403.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996587},{"amount":195,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":605.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842103}],"funded_date":"2009-04-19T01:48:18Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":106390,"name":"Maryline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maryline A.

For the past six years, she has been engaged in arduous work cultivating potatoes that are native to this area.  Once the crops are planted, she must wait six months before she can sell her harvest in the major markets that supply the surrounding cities.  At the same time, Nolberta breeds animals for sale and for personal consumption.  All of her family members perform work around their farm, which reduces their costs of hiring laborers for planting and harvesting.

L. is from the village of Tangaro, Catarman Camiguin Province. She is 41 years old. Violeta is widowed and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Violeta runs a business in the service sector. The main source of income for the business comes from providing transport services to community members with her pedicab vehicle. Violeta has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Violeta joined HSPFI in order to gain access to financial services that could help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Violeta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. Violeta is requesting the same amount (that is, 11,000 PHP), which will be used to purchase materials to improve her business. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Violeta from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married to Angoudu Emmanuel and has three kids below 15 years of age. Being a hard working lady, she has faced so many challenges in life including ill health and being unable to take care of her children. Due to all of these challenges, she made up her mind to become a GHAPE member in the year 2008.I n this same year, she received her pioneer loan of 40,000FRS, and the repayment was done promptly. \r\n         With a loan of 200,0000FRS, she plans to buy seven tins of corn, five tins of beans, 4 tins of garri, and 5 buckets of cocoyams. The loan repayment will start from the day the loan is disbursed. She is sure the business will succeed because she has been doing this business for a long  time. She has a good location for her business and she has a lot of customers. Her neighbors are happy the business is located next door because they don't have to go far to the market and can buy from her late at night. She plans to use the profits to plough back into the business, cater for her son, and give good medical attention to herself and her children. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the social services GHAPE offers and the convenient method of repayment.\r\n             The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":468967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy and sell corn, beans, garri, and cocoyams.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntarikon, Bamenda, NW.

Ulugbek is a 33-year-old married man with 4 children and parents under his care. Ulugbek is a hard-working man who, while continuing to work another job, started his own business as a source of additional income and savings in case of unemployment. He knew many people who purchased sheep and this motivated him to start his own business 5 years ago. Over time, he has increased his sheep sales and he is proud to say that the business has been running well. Now Ulugbek needs additional capital to expand and is requesting a loan in the amount of $2200 USD to purchase additional sheep to sell. More specifically, he will reinvest the loan proceeds and grow the business, as he has been doing. Ulugbek and his family thank you very much for the support that you offer them in helping to expand his business and give their children a better quality of life.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He currently has 5 workers helping him to produce starch, whom he pays for each week worked.  \r\n\r\nWhat he likes about his work is working in the fields, as he comments that he is used to it, and he enjoys farming and working the land.  In spite of this, what he doesn't like about his work are the insect infestations that damage the harvest and cause production losses.  But this doesn't discourage him, and he has plans to grow his business and move into growing palms for palm oil, as he has seen that there is significant demand for this.\r\n\r\nThis will be his third loan with the MFP institution.

All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n\r\n<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":25861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-13T04:43:49Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-28T15:08:07Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21427},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T22:36:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31810},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:30:11Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51899},{"amount":418,"local_amount":418,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T22:06:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":418,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107770}],"funded_date":"2007-04-14T15:08:07Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T22:06:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12174,"name":"Khaqani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"O.

She requests a loan to buy products to sell and stock her general store with fruit, breads, sodas, etc. In spite of her youth, she has been working from an early age because she lives with her Aunt, who raised her. Aside from working, she studies and is an example to her community because of her effort and hard work.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Eliana Colunga, Kiva volunteer<\/b><P>\r\n\r\n\r\nLa joven Darling de 25 a\u00f1os de edad habita en Hialeah en donde tiene una Pulper\u00eda, adem\u00e1s vende ropa y electrodom\u00e9sticos por encargo, desde hace cinco a\u00f1os empez\u00f3 a trabajar para mantenerse sola.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For 5 years, she has been selling clothing and beauty products by catalogue from a nationally-known line of cosmetics. She sells these products door-to-door in her locality, accepting cash and credit payments. Charito works only evenings because she takes care of the household chores in the morning. She really likes her job because it allows her to get to know many people, which is beneficial because she obtains more customers that way. Her biggest challenge is when people do not make payments, but other than that, her business is prosperous.

Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,000 PHP,  uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th loan cycle, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital to expand her pig fattening business and to buy more stock for her general store so that she could continue to save up for future for the betterment of her business. Marcelina S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Heligena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase materials needed to expand services provided. Heligena is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed for the maintenance of the service. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Heligena from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Her children are all grown up but two still live with her. She is also caring for a close family friend who has a brain tumor, but cannot afford medical care. With her loan she will invest in her rice production. As complimentary crops she farms cacao, mangoes and corn.

She also wants to finish a section of her home which is still under construction. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n\r\n<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":25908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-13T06:00:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-28T02:42:23Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21437},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T22:37:41Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31812},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:09:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51878},{"amount":912,"local_amount":912,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T22:11:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":912,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107772}],"funded_date":"2007-04-14T02:42:23Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T22:11:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12190,"name":"Tojiniso","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tojiniso is married and has 2 children.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:40:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mage M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:44:52Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356212},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347954},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970528},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886745},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436005}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:44:52Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65450,"name":"Batuli's Tusongembele Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Batuli is married with three children aged 20,18 and six years old.

S.L.M.B. was established in 1961 by Alhaji Sorie Kanu to provide education for the people of Magburaka and for the propagation of Islam. Today, it has a total of 616 pupils with a staff of eighteen teachers and administrators. \r\n\r\nS.L.M.B Secondary School had never got a loan from SMT before.  They heard of SMT from colleagues in other schools who have benefited greatly from SMT\u2019s services. They decided to form a group and send in an application to SMT requesting a loan after hearing these other success stories. With the loan, some of the staff members will start a small business and those who are already running small businesses will invest the loan into their business. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children's education or for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in home building projects.  \r\n\r\nGovernment salaries are usually quite small for teachers, thus making teaching an unattractive profession for many whose primary motivator is money. Many choose other jobs over teaching because of the small salary, thus starving the field of qualified personnel to teach the children. The few who remain in the classroom have to find other ways of making ends meet. The vast majority of them engage in either business or agriculture or they provide extra tutorial classes for the children (although this is a practice the government is trying to stop). Needless to say, loans from SMT are a great help to the teachers in order to boost their businesses or invest in something productive. Many want to go to school but could not afford the cost. Some will want to buy pieces of furniture, but their monthly salary is not enough to let them do so. With a loan, they will be able to meet some of these needs.  And with their monthly salaries, they can repay easily via a payroll deduction type of system.\r\n\r\nFifty-seven year old David P. G. (second from Left) is the principal of the school.  He was born in Matotoka, eight miles from Magburaka town. He is married to two wives and has fifteen children \u2013 between the ages of two and twenty-six. He has been a principal for the past twenty-one years. With this loan, David will buy building materials. Mr. David will be very pleased to receive this loan as it will enable him to speedily complete his house building project.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":285672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy house building materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Magburaka, Tonkolili","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-03-14T06:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" David P.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alusine ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Macwarr I.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Bernad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mustapha ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":360000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":120,"local_amount":360000,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":363000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025745},{"amount":30,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:06:22Z","rounded_local_amount":90750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44611613},{"amount":150,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:55:34Z","rounded_local_amount":453750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008548},{"amount":180,"local_amount":540000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":544500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230885},{"amount":240,"local_amount":720000,"processed_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":726000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102891},{"amount":120,"local_amount":360000,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:02:44Z","rounded_local_amount":363000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019907},{"amount":120,"local_amount":360000,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:34:56Z","rounded_local_amount":363000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864752},{"amount":120,"local_amount":360000,"processed_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":363000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110754561},{"amount":120,"local_amount":360000,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:32:29Z","rounded_local_amount":363000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118143583}],"funded_date":"2009-03-15T14:07:08Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:32:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":98230,"name":"Cynthia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cynthia J. has a sow.

All the preceding loans were correctly repaid.  \r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy fertilizer, herbicide, and minor supplies and equipment and to cover the cost of weeding and labor for maintaining 24 hectares.  \r\n\r\nA portion of their production is consumed at home.  The other portion is sold after harvesting to customers composed of men and women in Marka-Coungo and Fana.  \r\n\r\nThe group members plan on realizing an average profit of 30,000 francs CFA after the planting campaign.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":363831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Labor, fertilizer, herbicide, weeding and sundry supplies and equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mah                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mouna                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fadio Rokia            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aby                                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soungoura                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kotene                               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salamata                              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":405000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":405000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":405000,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":409655.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021313}],"funded_date":"2009-09-09T19:30:52Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":131016,"name":"Reina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Reina es socia del Banco Comunal Wi\u00f1arisun que significa Crezcamos en quechua.\nReina es casada, tiene 49 a\u00f1os y 6 hijos, Reina viaja a las diferentes ferias de la regi\u00f3n en donde compra animales, luego los comercializa en la ciudad de Ayacucho, adem\u00e1s Reina tiene una tienda de abarrotes en su casa.\nReina necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1000 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de gallina, cuy.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Reina son mejorar su negocio y brindar una buena educaci\u00f3n a sus hijos.\n\n","en":"Reina is a member of the Winarisun Community Bank.

In this way, he is able to maintain his family. \r\n\r\nToday this gentleman needs to acquire a loan to buy seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants for planting wheat, watermelon and onion. For this reason Muhammadjon has come to IMON International to obtain the  necessary loan so that he can continue caring for his humble family that needs his support. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 2 children who are 7 months and 5 years old. \r\n\r\nRachelle joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rachelle has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 13000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nRachelle is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Thanks to a first loan of $400 dollars, he was able to install a corn mill in his town and run it with rigor and efficiency.  The scope of this activity has allowed him to lighten the suffering of his family. In light of the significant activity at his mill each day, Mr F.

This is why he\u2019s asking for a loan of $850 which will allow him to rent a locale, buy a second mill and have it installed. This will help speed up service and ease the long lines waiting to use his first mill. This will allow Mr. F.

She 's from central Santa Mar\u00eda. She makes clothing and also has a business buying and selling livestock. She's been supporting herself for the last 4 years. She works from home, making clothing but she also travels constantly to the fairs in Taraco, Juliaca and Azangaro where she sells livestock. Depending on the schedule of each district, she usually works at the fairs on Thursdays or sometimes Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays -- it's very tiring, especially transferring livestock. Eduarda enjoys the financial independence her job allows her as she can help with household expenses and feel useful in society. Her wish is to continue working hard in order to better her economic stability, and as such, be able to have a family of her own in the future. With the money from the loan, Eduarda would like to buy more material to make her clothing and more livestock so she can increase her income.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Beatriz Yuste, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":213651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy more material to make clothing, and increase the amount of livestock she has to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-15T13:57:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eduarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-29T20:54:37Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5336150},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957379},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227629},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422864},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116087},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:44Z","rounded_local_amount":179.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011047}],"funded_date":"2008-10-15T20:54:37Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Yuste","image":1669109}},{"id":73670,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa tiene 55 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de 5 hijos que ya son independientes y la apoyan mucho.

She is married and the loving mother of three children, who are the reason for her daily fight for a better life. Shahodat sells women's traditional dresses and skull-caps in one of the famous local markets called \u201cPanjshanbe\u201d. <P>\r\n\r\nShahodat is a very hard-working woman. She always achieves all her goals and overcomes different challenges with natural optimism. She is requesting a loan of 1000 USD for the term of 12 months to re-stock her inventory. She is hoping to purchase more merchandise at affordable wholesale prices for further retail sale. The only dream of Shahodat is to ensure her children of a good education and to make them happy. We believe Shahodat\u2019s integrity and the consistent growth of her venture in the past years can guarantee further stable expansion of her venture and timely loan repayment. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Now the \"Chinese\" is driving himself and is very happy for this. \r\n<p>\r\nAt 4:00 AM he is already queuing up in line waiting for his turn, but many times, before his turn people ask for his services. On these days his earnings increase from 40 soles per day to 80 soles, which is why he always gets up very early. Victor plans to work very hard to improve the quality of life for his family, and have another business so that his wife does not have to sacrifice so much at the farm. Victor is going to his wife's village bank because she had to travel for the death of a family member. Now Victor is assuming his wife's responsibility of attending each of the payment meetings.

against any harm brought about by poverty, as they grow old. She joined ASHI, a KIVA field partner in the Philippines, to be able to access a loan. This opportunity will enable her to put up her own business, bandi making (coconut candy making), and be economically independent from her husband who is a farmer. Bandi is one of the famous delicacies of Antique province. Most of the customers buying this delicacy are tourists and they are buying bandi for a present when they go home to their own places. Profits she will be getting out of this business will be her means to augment her husband\u2019s sporadic income. Most of her earnings will be saved for her and her husband\u2019s needs in the future and some will be used to support her children\u2019s family, which is also poor. Though her children no longer live with her, she can\u2019t afford seeing them suffer because of poverty. Through loans she can request, she believes that the business she\u2019ll be financing will bring change to her family's lives.

She owns and operates a weaving business, primarily selling personal home products like plastic wares to local community members. She has been engaged in her business for over fifteen years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Jovita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC.\r\n\r\nJovita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be her ninth from GDMPC.

This will increase Getrude\u2019s sales revenue and enable her to pay her daily bills including her children\u2019s school bills.\r\n\r\nGetrude belongs to a group of nine members who hold each other accountable and insure one another in paying back the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":524700,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase farm tools like hoes, manure and mulches","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-04-17T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Getrude","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gereva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Slyvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gaudensio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jolly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yosam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":316666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":316666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":316666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":316666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":316666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":316666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":145.42,"local_amount":298699,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":300313.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144767285},{"amount":162.91,"local_amount":334635,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:47:01Z","rounded_local_amount":336443.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662303},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":316666.01,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":318377.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689075},{"amount":144.26,"local_amount":296315.99,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":297917.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903295},{"amount":151.08,"local_amount":310318,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":311995.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296859},{"amount":153.12,"local_amount":314516,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":316216,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467194},{"amount":14.04,"local_amount":28850,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":29005.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182606001}],"funded_date":"2010-04-17T17:51:30Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:23:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":197426,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary sells planks at retail prices to her customers in Ibadan.

Even though they are financially independent, her children still live in her house located in the city of Pichanaki.  Her farmland produces all types of natural products that are indigenous to the area.  Roberta has been farming with great care for the past 15 years.  In addition, she manufactures bricks along with her husband.  They both enjoy the work and find it rewarding since it allow them to live comfortably.  What she enjoys most about farming is clearing her land because it allows her crops the best chance to develop properly.  However, transporting her harvest to market is difficult because the loads are heavy and the cost of moving the freight is expensive.  Her entrepreneurial spirit has proven to be an advantage because it has enabled her to continue working.  Roberta now yearns to open a grocery store in her home where she can sell retail and wholesale with hopes of becoming one of the largest distributors in the area.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  Roberta is familiar with the work methodology of her Communal Bank and happy to continue her membership because her group is very close and demanding when it comes to completing their payments.  As a result, Roberta has become a responsible person.  With the loan she requested, Roberta will hire workers to rid her farmland of weeds.  She will also buy insecticides to guard against pests that can impact her crops.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":541988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase insecticides & hire workers to remove weeds from her land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-20T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":526.9,"local_amount":1437,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1496.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886440},{"amount":23.1,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":65.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327844}],"funded_date":"2010-05-21T17:32:22Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":205620,"name":"Ami Chantal Essenam","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette femme s\u2019est sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans le commerce  de pagnes  depuis 2007, elle a associ\u00e9 \u00e0 cela la vente d\u2019eau en sachet  appel\u00e9e pure WATER.

There she sells pozole, tacos, enchiladas, tostadas etc. She opens the restaurant on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. During the week she sells vegetables from a stand she has in the downtown area.  She is married to Isidro, a butcher, and they have 3 children together. The eldest girl is married. The second youngest is 12 years old and she is in primary school and Jesus Guadalupe is 1 year old.  She wishes to invest in her business with the purchase of grocery items.

She and her husband work hard because they are having a house built for them. She says that they are saving to purchase windows and doors.

In 1993, in order to find a means of subsistence, they went off to Russia in search of a living and worked in a cafe. In 2006 they came back to Kyrgyzstan and opened a cafeteria in Osh city, using a start-up capital of 20,000 KGS. They worked a lot to make their caf\u00e9 one of the most popular places, and achieved success. \r\n\r\nBut in June of 2010, when violent clashes caused by the deposed political regime broke out in Osh city, Gulsara lost her business. Her cafeteria was robbed and burned. But Gulsara, being a very optimistic person, didn\u2019t give in. In order to reconstruct her cafeteria, she decided to engage in reselling foodstuffs. She rented a selling place at the local market and took different kinds of frozen goods on credit from her business partners. This fact indicates a great confidence in Gulsara\u2019s personality and the prosperous future of her business.\r\n \r\nNow, Gulsara is applying for a loan of 135.000 KGS, which she needs to broaden her assortment of goods.

She works selling different types of things on credit, including blankets, beds, pots, sets of glassware, and gifts. Wilma has on average 50 to 70 customers in different zones, including in public offices. She speaks with her future customers and they make different requests which she purchases and then later she collects payments weekly or monthly, with an increase for time payment. The advantage of this activity is that Wilma has her customers select the products they want rather than as with other persons, first buying the products before offering them for sale.

He and his family of four children all still live on the farm. He works the fields with his sons, one who is pictured, and they all share in the profits. He also grows watermelons, maize and green peppers on his farm. He will be very happy to receive a loan and hopes he can invest in fertilizers and pesticides to nurture his crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":25974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Ovidio would like to invest in fertilizers and pesticides for his rice farm where he also grows watermelons, maize and green peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T20:26:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ovidio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T21:46:22Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":950,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":76,"local_amount":76,"processed_date":"2007-06-18T19:20:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":24202},{"amount":76,"local_amount":76,"processed_date":"2007-07-20T17:13:39Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33943},{"amount":76,"local_amount":76,"processed_date":"2007-08-20T18:21:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44797},{"amount":76,"local_amount":76,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T17:30:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71886},{"amount":646,"local_amount":646,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:17:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":646,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107738}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T21:46:22Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T21:17:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12222,"name":"Maria Isabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>My name is Maria C. and I sell farming products.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Mavzuna D. is 41 years old, and a widow with two children. She graduated from high school, and sells women's clothing and fabric at the Panjshanbe market.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Last year, her business was affected by the price drop in the commodities market due to the economic crisis in Mongolia. She says that the business is starting to pick up and the demand for commodities is slowing recovering.
