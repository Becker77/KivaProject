To make matooke, get a big pot, put a little water in the bottom, buy a clump of green bananas still on the stem with maybe 100 bananas on the stalk. Everything gets used, so cut the stalk in slices and place in the bottom of the pot and cover with banana leaves. Now peel those green bananas and place them on top of the leaves and cover with more leaves, so that the heat doesn\u2019t escape. Losing heat means wasting charcoal which costs money. Let it simmer for 3-4 hours, remove, mash and presto: matooke!\r\n\r\nBehind Regina is her restaurant where the cooking is always done outside.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Eka has 7 years of experience in this business.  Eka needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 tala or US $42 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Eka joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Eka's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Eka S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.56 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.89 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.99 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Eleanor also helps care for two of her aunts.\r\n<p>\r\nEleanor's business is making and selling tie-dyed clothes, something she's been doing for four years. She says she started her business with 500 LRD in seed money, and now she operates with 6000 LRD in working capital. She says her enterprise is a success. She also says that she faces difficulty when she allows customers to buy on credit, and they don't pay her back promptly. Eleanor sells the clothes she creates at the Chicken Soup Factory Market in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her 15,000-LRD share of this 95,000-LRD group loan, Eleanor intends to buy more materials to make tie-dyed clothes. She says the colors of her clothes are nice, which is what keeps her customers coming back. She hopes to provide the means for all her children to get a good education.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Eleanor is the one holding the sign.

She hopes to be able to use this loan to purchase a greater quantity of fish in order to get a better discount and increase her profit margin.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Felicita raises animals in the yard behind the home she shares with her sisters. The family raises these animals on rice chaff and local grasses until they are large enough to sell for their meat.\r\n\r\nFelicita currently has no loans outstanding and has good references within the community.

At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college.

She sells branded cosmetics, apparel, footwear, household detergents, and other personal products. She allows her customers to order from her based on a product catalog, then orders these items from the company office at a discounted price. Monthly, Teresita earns an estimated net income of around 11,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting an 18,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy items ordered in advance by her customers like cosmetics and apparels. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nTeresita dreams of being able to give all of her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work in her business. She prays that her business will become successful and aims for financial stability someday. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship meeting* where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis. The fellowship groups gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.

In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cIn spite of the countless social difficulties that arise from the disastrous economic situation, the village of Diourbel has kept alive its ancient tradition of producing tourgui ndiareme textiles.  Although the women of Diourbel have been severely affected by the economic hardship, they jealously guard the secrets of weaving these small wrap outfits, which are highly prized by both locals and outsiders.  With the recent acceleration in migration out of rural areas, women occupy a strategic position in the area of clothing production and other crafts.  These products are easily marketed thanks to the numerous loumas (weekly markets) and Diourbel's proximity to the holy city of Touba, which attracts enormous crowds in its seasonal pilgrimages.  This has been a boon to the women who supplement their families' incomes with local trading activities.  In order to strengthen these activities, the members of our group always need to augment their available stock so that they can ensure continuous and diversified production.  Since many women compete in this market, the members of our group also plan to introduce the sale of finished products purchased in other loumas.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Business description translated from French by Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance Fund. <\/b>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u00abDIOURBEL malgr\u00e9 les multiples probl\u00e8mes sociaux li\u00e9s \u00e0 la situation \u00e9conomique d\u00e9sastreuse a gard\u00e9 une veille tradition dans le domaine du textile et de la confection (tourgui ndiar\u00e8me).

Because customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, the women lack tangible collateral assets, and financial institutions do not consider them to be credit-worthy. This leads to poor financial support and, as a result, limited access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. When a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys the equipment from the client, extends a loan to her, and then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a \"sale and leaseback\" arrangement.<\/P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":152095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a motorbike to pick up supplies and make deliveries to customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-04-23T15:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-07T21:02:23Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58,"local_amount":70608.7,"processed_date":"2008-06-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":71456,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":231132},{"amount":58,"local_amount":70608.7,"processed_date":"2008-07-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":71456,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":260210},{"amount":58,"local_amount":70608.7,"processed_date":"2008-08-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":71456,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":289027},{"amount":58,"local_amount":70608.7,"processed_date":"2008-09-07T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":71456,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":319328},{"amount":58,"local_amount":70608.7,"processed_date":"2008-10-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-18T07:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":71456,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":351366},{"amount":55,"local_amount":66956.5,"processed_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":67759.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347616},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:56Z","rounded_local_amount":70840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970236},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":70840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886486},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":70840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435771},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":70840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130076}],"funded_date":"2008-04-23T21:02:23Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":49511,"name":"Theong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theong L. is a rice farmer in Kampong Cham.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":224976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To expand her grocery store and hair salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T01:30:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970758},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886975},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436235},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130507},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027304},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:30Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613324},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010407},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232718},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664534},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105265}],"funded_date":"2008-11-15T19:08:20Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Olson","image":null}},{"id":78202,"name":"Mumtaz Barkat Ali Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Mumtaz baji is a 41 year old married woman and resides in Lahore, Pakistan.

She wants to buy these items in advance in order to get a lower price, and to avoid borrowing money from her neighbor during planting season. When she borrows from her neighbor, she usually pays back in rice grains after harvest which is very disadvantageous to her.

She is 42 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Imelda prepares and sells food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks like bread, chips, fish balls, and other dim sums to the local community. Imelda has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Imelda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Imelda is requesting a loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be Imelda's first loan from ASKI.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherpeople, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":658735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is 44 years old. Daisy is the group leader of a six member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Daisy R.'s Group.\r\n\r\nDaisy is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Daisy owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Daisy has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Daisy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Daisy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand product offering. Daisy is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Daisy from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She likes both businesses as they generate the income necessary to live a more comfortable life, in addition to financial support from her children, since that money was saved and used as seed money, and seeing that her capital is growing, she plans to invest in a grocery store that she would install at home. This is the first loan with the MFP institution, she feels satisfied with the financial support to realize her plans. With the amount requested of 800 nuevos soles she will invest in buying staples to implement her store and get it going."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":955881,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy staples to set up her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-25T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":87},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":92.41},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":89.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":99.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":102.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":103.62},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":110.61},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":114.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.65},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.73},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.48},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.63,"local_amount":87,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":87.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836373},{"amount":34.65,"local_amount":92.41,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:51Z","rounded_local_amount":93.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246159},{"amount":33.73,"local_amount":89.96,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":90.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386175},{"amount":37.21,"local_amount":99.21,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":100.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099266},{"amount":38.59,"local_amount":102.92,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":103.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713416},{"amount":38.86,"local_amount":103.62,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:30Z","rounded_local_amount":104.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202304},{"amount":41.48,"local_amount":110.61,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":111.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097985},{"amount":42.85,"local_amount":114.27,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":115.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400866}],"funded_date":"2011-12-26T09:44:41Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Reynolds","image":635173}},{"id":378195,"name":"Kiwambi Cha Umoja Ni Nguvu Masimeri Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Matride, 54 years old, is the mother of ten children, three attending secondary school.

It consists of a woven and embroidered rectangular blouse called a \u201chuipil\u201d (wee-peel), wrap around woven skirt or \u201ccorte\u201d and an embroidered and woven belt called a \u201cfaja\u201d. The predominant languages are the indigenous language of K\u2019ich\u00e9 and Spanish. \n\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cBarrio San Antonio\u201d is located here and is composed of seven entrepreneurial women. Julia, who is a member of the Trust Bank, is 42 years old and has been married for 20 years; she has five children who range in age from 7-18. Julia is working hard so that each of her children can have formal education since she realizes how important it is. She was only able to study until the 6th grade. She is empowered, motivated and appreciates her loan that she is going to use in her beekeeping and textile businesses. She raises bees, as well as embroiders and weaves the traditional \u201chuipiles\u201d of her town. Julia also distributes natural medicines to sick children in her area. She is requesting a loan to buy a number of supplies for her textile business including thread, wool, silk, and other needed supplies. She wants to have plenty of raw materials for her textile treasures, especially at this time of the year. Julia has utilized part of her income to purchase a plot of land, repair and expand her home, buy a computer and most importantly, send her children to school.\n \nThe ladies look forward to their monthly meetings when they have the opportunity to socialize, make payments on their loans and participate in educational trainings conducted by a Facilitator from Friendship Bridge. A specific topic is covered at each meeting and the Facilitator uses games, role playing, pictures and diagrams to share the information.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Lino has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 400 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lino joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Lino has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,000 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. \r\n\r\nLino is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be her second loan from SPBD. Lino plans to use the additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":364859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Si usted  visita a Elena puede encontrarla en pleno proceso, con sus compa\u00f1eros de producci\u00f3n, que son sus hijos,: entre todos deshojan el ma\u00edz , desprenden los granos, que someten a molienda, para luego amasarlos, envolverlos en las mismas hojas del bollo, amarrarlos y finalmente someterlos a la respectiva cocci\u00f3n; para que cuando ya est\u00e1n listos, puedan ser adquiridos mediante su compra por los clientes, ubicados en el mismo barrio donde vive y especialmente  en tiendas del sector, all\u00ed son vendidos al consumidor final. Para el desarrollo de esta actividad, Elena cuenta con un molino el\u00e9ctrico, al que ya es hora de hacerle una buena reparaci\u00f3n y tambi\u00e9n tiene   todos las herramientas necesaria para el proceso; Este es su segundo financiamiento con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con \u00e9l comprar\u00e1 enseres menores, reparar\u00e1 su molino,  y comprar\u00e1 laminas de eternit, cemento y baldosas  para adecuar su pisos y proteger su espacio productivo, debido a que cuando llueve se filtra el agua, generando condiciones de deterioro e inseguridad al trabajar.\nElena cuenta, que antes de estar vinculada a la Fundaci\u00f3n, manten\u00eda cr\u00e9ditos costosos para poder comprar su materia prima e insumos, ahora se siente mas tranquila porque est\u00e1 mas holgada con el capital adicional que le presta esta organizaci\u00f3n; igualmente manifiesta que su negocio ha crecido tanto en ventas como en estructura con este impulso. Su sue\u00f1o se concentra  mas adelante en finalizar su vivienda, para mejorar sus condiciones habitacionales, que tanto convienen tambi\u00e9n al negocio, en su imagen y presentaci\u00f3n y este es justamente su gran desaf\u00edo.\n","en":"Elena A. Rodr\u00edguez is 54 years old.  She has lived in Bol\u00edvar department since 1999.  She arrived in Barranquilla with her husband and her 9 children aged between 14 and 27.  She had the idea to start making 'bollos' (corn and cheese-based wraps), making use of her knowledge and experience in the business.  She started with 13 corncobs and made 12 'bollos' which she then sold.  From that moment, her business has become the main source of support for her household.  She has increased her production to 100 'bollos' a day.  If you visited Elena you would find her in the middle of making her 'bollos' with her children who are her production colleagues.  Between them they shuck the corn, remove the grain which they then mill, make the dough, wrap the 'bollos' up in the corn husks, tie them up and finally cook them.  When they are ready they are bought by her customers who are in her neighborhood, especially those who own stores where the 'bollos' are finally sold to the end customer.\r\n\r\nTo carry out her activity, Elena has an electric mill which now needs to be repaired and all the other equipment which she needs for her production process.  This is the second loan which Elena has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy small utensils, to repair her mill and to buy corrugated metal sheeting, cement and tiles to adapt her premises and protect her production space because when it rains the water drips in which causes damage and lack of safety while she is working.\r\n\r\nElena tells us that before she was a member of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, she used expensive loans to buy raw material and ingredients.  Now she feels more relaxed because she is more comfortable with the capital which this organization provides her with.  She also says that her business has grown both in terms of sales and in structure as a result of this investment.  Her dream for the future is to finish the building work on her home, to improve her living conditions which are so important for her business too both in terms of image and presentation.  This is her biggest challenge."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":638091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has been a real estate agent for the past 30 years, and a real estate broker for the last two.  Lydia got into the real estate business after buying her first home.  She says a poor understanding of the business side of home buying made her feel vulnerable throughout the process and motivated her to educate herself.  She took courses in real estate management, which eventually led to her becoming a certified real estate agent.  Lydia holds a bachelors degree from Texas State University, from which she graduated Summa Cum Laude in 2005.\n\nBeing a certified real estate broker means she has the credentials to manage her own real estate business without operating through a middleman.  Lydia has a small office with a conference room where she can meet with clients.  She says that meeting a potential client is much like an interview, and that having an office gives her business professional credibility.  In addition to herself, Lydia currently has one real estate agent that works for A Plus Real Estate.\n\nWhen Lydia decided to start A Plus Real Estate, she wanted to do it alone, without any outside financing.  This strained her resources.  Early on, she invested too much of the company\u2019s revenues back into the business, assuming she could pay herself with future business transactions.  Overextended, she found herself in a bind when business temporarily slowed.  She soon realized paying cash for everything was not practical, and decided it would be prudent to take out a small loan to help cover operating expenses.\n\nShe first heard of ACCION Texas-Louisiana years ago through a San Antonio Express-News article written about the organization and its CEO, Janie Barrera.  Lydia found the article inspiring and saved it.  When she decided to apply for a loan, she remembered the article and decided to apply through ACCION Texas-Louisiana.\n\nLydia never wants her business to grow to the point that it costs her customers quality of service.  She says she would someday like to have 10 real estate agents with A Plus Real Estate, but says she does not want to overextend herself and wants her business to grow naturally.  This summer, she expects to be ready to hire an additional two agents.\n\nCheck out her business at http:\/\/www.bestsanantoniodeals.com\/.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":727282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Help covering operating expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Antonio, Texas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2011-03-10T21:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1672,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":124.27},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":130.29},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":132.98},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":134.31},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":136.94},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":138.46},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":140.57},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":143.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":144.92},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":147.35},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":149.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":149.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.49},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.53},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.22},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.55},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.18},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.71},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.35},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.61},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.65},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":124.49,"local_amount":124.27,"processed_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:54:05Z","rounded_local_amount":124.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201207801},{"amount":130.53,"local_amount":130.29,"processed_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":130.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206076703},{"amount":133.22,"local_amount":132.98,"processed_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":133.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211145772},{"amount":134.55,"local_amount":134.31,"processed_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":134.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216431402},{"amount":137.18,"local_amount":136.94,"processed_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":137.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221596324},{"amount":138.71,"local_amount":138.46,"processed_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-29T07:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":138.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226966200},{"amount":140.82,"local_amount":140.57,"processed_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-28T07:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":140.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232725037},{"amount":735.5,"local_amount":734.18,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-23T08:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":735.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238529085}],"funded_date":"2011-03-16T11:12:06Z","paid_date":"2011-11-23T08:44:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":283929,"name":"Kadiatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 56 year-old Kadiatu.

She began her business because she learnt the business from her parents: \"Since I was not sent to school I preferred selling for my survival.\" \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about 100,000 Sierra Leonean leones (SLL) every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. Kadiatu requires a loan in order to buy more foodstuffs. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 300,000 SLL. In the future, Kadiatu plans to educate her children to university level.

Beginning with the starting sum of 10,000 soms (KGS) Adylbek was able to increase the headcount to three dairy cows and eighteen sheep as well as cultivate 1.8 hectares of land where he grows crops and sainfoin. This activity allows Adylbek to receive about 10,000 som (KGS) per month.\r\n\r\nTo further increase the number of livestock Adylbek has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional cattle for fattening. Adylbek intends to use the projected profit to reconstruct the barn in order to ensure good conditions for the livestock.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":943923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tuyp village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T03:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adylbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":433.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":433.33,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:05:52Z","rounded_local_amount":20176,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283072216},{"amount":216.67,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10088,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070922},{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":30264,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862765}],"funded_date":"2012-01-17T06:42:45Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:17:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":382308,"name":"Khun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khun, 57, is married and resides with her husband and five children in Takeo Province, Cambodia.

She joined in November of 2005 and currently works as a wire sorter for the Invisible Children Bracelet project. She is one of the younger members being only 20 years old. She is an orphan. Her parents died when she was only 8 leaving her and her two brothers alone.<\/p> <p>They were taken in by an aunt but life was very hard. The aunt, who was a widow herself, was taking care of many children and the grandmother who is blind. With very little money, food was often scarce and the only schooling Monica could afford was a tailor course. She did manage to get a job but could not earn enough money to exist on. Then she came to LiA. She now earns enough to help with food, rent, school fees for her brothers and support for her grandmother.<\/p> <p>With encouragement from her determined aunt, she is learning to be independent and to forget that she is an orphan. She has managed to save enough to set up a small shop. Her cousin runs the shop during the day while Monica works. Now she would like to do more. If she adds more stock to the shop, her profits will increase. She also plans to use her tailoring skills by purchasing a sewing machine. Since her shop has a big veranda, she will put this sewing machine there and use on the weekends to earn money. For this project she is seeking a loan of 800,000\/=.

Her eldest child works and the youngest attends school.  \r\n<p>\r\nBecause of the bad influence of her friends Mar\u00eda did not finish school.  She left in her third year high school and began cleaning and cooking in houses.  She has always liked to cook and with time she opened a restaurant in her house, which she ran for six years.  She closed the restaurant because it was such difficult work.  She decided to rest for a time and approximately two years ago she was presented with the opportunity of making lunches at her husband\u2019s workplace where he is a master builder.

G. is 51 years old and a well-known beauty stylist in the Simon Bolivar neighborhood of the city of Barranquilla, which is considered to have one of the most comprehensive infrastructures.  It offers a wide range of services including shops, sports venues, places of worship, financial service institutions, and an extensive public transportation route.  The residents of the neighborhood are very proud that they were able to secure these amenities.  Five Colombians and three Germans had the idea to build a bridge between the coast and the Colombian interior.  This led to the start of Colombo-German Air Transport Society (or <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SCADTA\" target=\"_blank\" >SCADTA<\/a>), which later became Avianca, thereby making Barranquilla the birthplace of civil aviation in Latin America.\r\n<p> \r\nAdela studied nursing and then cosmetology.  She personally finds the beauty sector to be more satisfying personally.  Adela provides styling and aesthetic care services such as haircuts (for men, women, and children), manicures, and pedicures from her small location.  At the same time, she manages a public telephone service.  Everyone in her family participates in the business.  Her husband lost his job and started an independent messaging service while selling food.  They have five children between the ages of 17 and 31.  All of them attended school, but the three youngest children are still in college while the others are already working.  Adela is thankful that her children have the opportunity to pursue an education because her dream has always been for them to be independent, self-reliant, and self-sufficient, and an education has allowed them to achieve this goal.  She is requesting a loan to pay the college expenses of her daughter, who is studying in her fifth semester of Occupational Therapy and also helps with the family microenterprise activities.\r\n<p> \r\nAdela has been working with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for three years.  She learned about the organization from a one of her customers who she saw on a limited basis and suggested that she apply for a loan.  Adela is opposed to buying anything on credit, but now she can make cash purchases and also acquire supplies cheaper and in large quantities even though it may require spending more money.  As a stylist, she is able to sell hair products to her customers, which helps to grow her business.  She enjoys being a client of the Foundation because she has not experienced any problems and her loans have been manageable.  \r\n<p>\r\nAdela has not had many difficulties in her business because she experienced success from the very beginning.  It helps that her beauty shop is located in the Simon Bolivar neighborhood because of the number of passing vehicles and presence of heavy foot traffic from the commercial boulevard.  She is now planning to expand her salon because there is not enough space to accommodate more than one employee.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":478802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"Pay for her daughter's college expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-01-30T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1783523,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":279162},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":289759},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":294589},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":299498},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":304490},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":316025}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.87},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.22},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.65},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.14},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.65},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":140.87,"local_amount":279162,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":280062.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949025},{"amount":146.22,"local_amount":289759,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":290693.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677816},{"amount":148.65,"local_amount":294589,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":295538.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712190},{"amount":151.14,"local_amount":299498,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:30Z","rounded_local_amount":300463.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895695},{"amount":153.65,"local_amount":304490,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:03Z","rounded_local_amount":305471.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636019},{"amount":159.47,"local_amount":316025,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":317044.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850121}],"funded_date":"2010-01-31T10:14:26Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":177047,"name":"Mar\u00eda Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco Comunal Mujer y Fortaleza se form\u00f3 en la parroquia Turi al sureste de la ciudad de Cuenca, sector conocido como el balc\u00f3n de la ciudad es muy tur\u00edstico por la belleza natural del campo, la gastronom\u00eda y la amabilidad de su gente, la mayor parte de su poblaci\u00f3n  se dedica a la agricultura y a otras  actividades que les permiten salir adelante junto a sus familias.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda G.  es socia de \u00e9ste banco hace tres ciclos, goza de  una gran amistad con todas las integrantes de su banco  y es una mujer muy alegre, tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad es casada y tiene cinco  hijos que se encuentran de 9, 7, 4, 2 a\u00f1os y el ultimo de 2 meses, su esposo es alba\u00f1il y la casa en la que habitan es propia siendo el fruto de muchos a\u00f1os de trabajo.\n\nNuestra socia vive a las afueras de la ciudad de Cuenca  en el sector Punta Corral, se dedica al cultivo de tierras ajenas los d\u00edas que le dan  trabajo y los otros  a cultivar sus propias tierras y al cuidado de sus animales pues   posee dos borregos y una ternera que los adquiri\u00f3 con los cr\u00e9ditos obtenidos de la Fundaci\u00f3n, y con el  dinero que reciba del nuevo pr\u00e9stamo va a comprar pollos y alimento  para montar este nuevo negocio.

Her husband is a bricklayer and their many years of hard work have enabled them to own their own home.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda G. lives on the outskirts of Cuenca in the Punta Corral area. She works tending others' fields on the days in which she can find such work, and on the other days she tends to her own land and animals. She has two lambs and a calf that she bought with funds borrowed through the Kiva field partner, and with the money from this new loan she is going to buy chickens and feed to get this new endeavor going. Her goal is to give her children a good education. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":490455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy chickens and corn for their feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-02-18T03:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Mar\u00eda Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":109,"local_amount":109,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:48Z","rounded_local_amount":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910756},{"amount":28.49,"local_amount":28.49,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":28.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946437},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946438},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674731},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708889},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892192},{"amount":91.7,"local_amount":91.7,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":91.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632602}],"funded_date":"2010-02-18T06:39:52Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

Her husband and her 23-year-old son are fishermen and have been earning money through fishing. Fe sells the fish they catch in their neighborhood.

Through this, Fe would be able to sell more fish in the market and in their neighborhood for bigger revenue. Aside from that, she also wants to have her own small \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store where she sells a few varieties of foodstuffs, beverages and other basic commodities.

A. is 37 years old and a native of Carmen de Bolivar, which is where he and his father own farmland on which they grow cassava and yams.  From a young age, he has come to know and appreciate the delight associated with these two products since they form the basis of his main business that he developed in the town of Soledad.  There he lives with his family, which consists of his wife and ten year old son.\r\n<p>\r\nJailer wakes up every morning at 5am and delivers his products by motorcycle to 25 stores that make up his existing customer base.  Throughout the morning he distributes cassava and yams that he harvested, as well as the famous \u201ccarmero\u201d avocado that is grown in Carmen de Bolivar.  \r\n<p>\r\nJailer may not always have yams and cassava to sell from either his land or his father\u2019s, so he also buys sheep in Monter\u00eda when necessary.  He wants to take advantage of his trips to Monter\u00eda by seizing the opportunity to sell yams, cassava, and avocados while he is there.  For this reason, he is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo (which he joined two years ago) in the amount of 2,000,000 COP.  He will buy 50 sturdy bags filled with cassava, yams, and carmero avocados so that he can sell his products in the markets where his suppliers are located.\r\n<p>\r\nJailer started this business after he quit his job at the central municipal supply depot, where he worked an extensive schedule from 3am to 8pm, which was made worse by the low pay.  Due to the exhaustion and the lack of time to devote to his family, he decided to become independent and start selling vegetables, tomato plants, and avocados.  He is always looking for better ways to earn more income and eventually became acquainted with several shopkeepers who started ordering yams, cassava, and avocados from him.  \r\n<p>\r\nSince joining Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, Jailer has been able to upgrade his means of transportation from a bicycle to a motorcycle so that he can travel with cargo, access more customers, and sell more of his products because credit was available to him.  Otherwise, he would have had difficulty traveling to his suppliers and would have eventually lost credibility in the marketplace.  He is now more comfortable working with credit and dreams of seeing his son become a professional and looking up to him.  In the future, he hopes to own a distribution truck so that he can sell basic necessities throughout Barranquilla and in other towns in the district of Atl\u00e1ntico.  \r\n<br

She is a single mother of five children but only four of them still live with her in her own house located in the outskirts of the city of San Rafael (Peruvian central jungle).  \r\n\r\nShe tries to avoid talking about the difficult situation she lived with the father of her children.  But she does state that what she managed to rescue from the experience is to value herself as a woman and, being very enterprising, she started to sell beer and carbonated soft drinks with the goal of supporting her children.  She also prepares food to sell at her tourist stop \u2018La Inolvidable\u201d (The Unforgettable One) that she recently opened.  On the other hand, she raises ducks and chickens that are later sold or used in the preparation of her stews.  Daniela\u2019s children help her and this is why the business is profitable: she does not have to pay salaries to kitchen help.  \r\n\r\nHer enterprising spirit led her to set up a farm in order to sell small farm animals at wholesale because sometime ago she made a good amount of money selling guinea pigs by the dozen.  Proudly she adds:  \u201cI raised 120 chickens.  I cared for them since they were very young and sold them for 35 soles a piece.  This is why I\u2019m so sure that this business will have very beneficial results.\u201d She concludes.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the \u201cLas Brisas\u201d (The Breezes) communal bank and this is the 8th loan with MFP.

is a very shy widow but is one of the more active savers in the SPBD programme. She joined the Centre at Tulaele in 2005. Since the husband died in 2003, she started thinking about ways of surviving with her two children and a grandmother. She got in, and her first Loan was 300 tala (US$ 120). This loan was used for purchase of  stocks for her small shop. With the second loan of  500 tala (US$ 200), she also spent it on more stocks.\r\n\r\nFonima paid off her loan promptly and was therefore entitled to get  1,250 tala (US$ 500)  on her next loan. Fonima already  spent the other two loans on the stock, and with this loan she thought of renovating her small shop, so she used it to double wall the inside of the store. Fonima is excited that these loans enable her family to go on and live since her husband died.\r\n\r\nAt the end of last year, Fonima paid off her loan and got another loan amounting to 1,750 tala (US$ 700). This loan also was used to further improve her store. As we have seen in the photo taken, the store looks new and it\u2019s just after the work done last week.\r\n\r\nApart from the Loans, on the other side, Fonima is one of the ladies that have a vision. This vision enables her to save the extra money. So she is done with the store but now she is looking of starting up the Elei Printing \u2013 a traditional Samoan way of printing fabrics using handcrafted

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

This is 30-year-old Neema M. from Mwanza. She is married with two children between the ages of seven and 11 years old. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because the child's parents do not take care of him. Neema has been running a tailoring business since 1998. She purchases vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print), and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides) and makes them into clothing mainly for women. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by two employees. Neema currently earns about 200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 425 USD in order to buy thread and kanga. In the future, she plans to employ more people. Neema thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":225104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

Mamu is a member of a HOPE RDC group that she joined in December 2008 with the goal of bolster her business.  One day she hopes to realize her dream of opening a general store.  She has been selling <i>beignets<\/i> since 2001 in an outlying district of Kinshasa.  Her loyal customers are mainly children and adolescents.  \r\n\r\nIn 2001, her initial capital was $1, which she multiplied through her efforts, correct management, and accumulated profits, all of which gained her $90 in capital in 2003.  From 2003-2008, Marie still worked a lot to attain $180 in capital.  She then started to receive loans from HOPE that she repaid completely.  Given the growing number of customers she has, Marie used the loans obtained last May for buying: a sack of wheat flour, a 25-liter drum of vegetable oil, a sack of sugar, and a container of leavening in order to satisfy the demand and also to grow her profits.  \r\n\r\nMarie is 36 years old, married, and the mother of son, age 20, who is a student.  She is very proud of her business and is determined to achieve her dream.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4050,"image":{"id":335562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy a sack of flour, a drum of vegetable oil, a sack of sugar, and some leavening to make more beignets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

He is 45 years old. Godofredo is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Godofredo operates a business raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting corn and cassava for sale. Godofredo has been engaged in his business for more than six years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos (about $84) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Godofredo joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Godofredo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from GDMPC. Godofredo is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the third loan taken out by Godofredo from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of his children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She and her younger sister live at home with their parents.  What she wants most is to improve her quality of life.  Starting around 7pm, she sells delicious kebabs (brochettes) from her food cart.  Rosemery is a very charismatic saleswoman who treats her customers with much kindness.  The seasoning she adds to her kebabs gives them more flavor.  As a result, her food stand is one of the busiest in the area.  What she likes most about her job is being around her customers and making conversation with them while she prepares their food.  Rosemery has only been in business for 6 months and she already knows that she is headed in the right direction.  She says the most difficult part of her job is staying up very late at night on the street and enduring the intense cold.  In the future, she hopes to open a fast food shop where she can attend to her customers in a calmer environment.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosemery is requesting her sixth loan with MFP.  She has not experienced any problems with making her payments and expects this time to be the same.  Her Communal Bank has tremendous confidence in her because she is considered to be one of the most serious and well respected members.  With her loan of 3000 soles, she plans to buy new pots and utensils for preparing her kebabs.  Any money left over will be used to purchase ingredients.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":375186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase utensils & ingredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-23T21:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":503.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081225},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":503.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997376},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":503.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842720},{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1511.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734302}],"funded_date":"2009-08-24T04:20:23Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":135637,"name":"Son","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S., 30, is a cooking supply trader.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in the tranquility of their home with 3 children: Edwin of 26, Becquer of 15, and Yois of 12 years of age.\r\n<p>\r\nTogether with her husband, she sows common vetch and potatoes in their own fields.  Both of them are struggling to get ahead for their minor children.  In addition, the children help with the sowing; it's a job that must be done with equipment so that the crop can advance under perfect conditions and the harvest may be prosperous.\r\n<p>\r\nLuisa also raises sheep and ewes, because as she herself says: \u201cTo raise animals is like insurance; when you have no money, you can sell them and get out of a tight spot.\u201d\r\n<p>\r\nIn the mountains of Peru work is constant and very hard; if you do it together it advances much better.  The family of this struggling woman knows that very well; they are not stopped by life's obstacles.  They are thinking about how to increase their agricultural production and acquire more milk cows.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Luisa's first loan with MFP and she assures us that she will be very punctual with each payment.   She wishes to continue progressing and to ask for more loans in the future.  The money she requests will be invested in manure to assure that the crop and its harvest may be reproductive.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

She is 65 years old. Milagros is married and has 6 adult-aged children. To make a living, Milagros owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Milagros has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Milagros joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Milagros has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Milagros is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Milagros from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":583367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The family's main source of income is farming, as Ma. Cecilia's husband is a farmer. Because of her husband's meager farming income, Ma. Cecilia decided to join Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. - Rizal East Branch, a Kiva partner microfinance institution in the Philippines, to start her own business in order to help her husband with their financial needs. Her previous loans were spent in the purchase and sale of livestock, particularly chickens, and from her income she was able to support her family's needs. From then on, all she dreamed of was to increase her capital in order to earn more profit. \r\n\r\n<p>Ma. Cecilia maintains her good performance in ASHI until she fully pays her loans. Now she is applying again for a new loan to augment the needed capital for her business. If approved, her plan is to buy and sell live chickens. From her earnings, she has been able to construct housing for her poultry and develop the skills for raising chickens. Her aim is to establish a good business so that she can help in providing for all her family's needs, especially for their education. One of her dreams is to renovate their house.

It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is married and the mother of five children: three daughters and two sons, the youngest of whom lives together with Khalila and helps her with her work.\r\n\r\nKhalila was born in an ordinary engineer\u2019s family with seven children. She was a middle child and spent a lot of time on household tasks. Her older sisters got married early, and she needed to take care of her younger sisters and brothers. After finishing high school, Khalila was admitted to a degree program in accounting at junior college, which is where she met her future husband. She got married at the age of 19. The spouses first lived in communal housing since Khalila\u2019s husband also comes from a large family, and the newlyweds did not have a home of their own. Two years later their first child was born. Khalila found a job with the local produce distribution society, where she would remain working  for 12 years. A year later she gave birth to her second child, a daughter. In 1986 and 1987, two more daughters came into the world. In 1993, due to economic difficulties,  the family moved to the village of Panfilovka (the district of Chuisk).  Two years into their life in Panfilovka, Khalla gave birth to another son. Khalila and her husband found work at the local collective farm and were allotted a land plot, on which they eventually had a house built. When the collective farm ceased functioning, they started working as farmers on leased land. In 1999, Khalila and her husband found jobs with the Roadway Management Office  #42: she is a senior specialist, and he as a driver. In 2010, they bought a house in the village of Voznesenovka (the district of Chuisk).\r\n\r\nWith time, their three daughters got married and settled independently. Because this, Khalila had to buy part of her cattel. At present, Khalila and her husband still work for Roadway Management Office  #42 and also raise cattle and grow crops on the land they lease. At present Khalila has one cow and one heifer. In order to obtain more cattle, Khalila approached Bai Tushum and Partners with a request of a loan of 50,000 KGS.\r\nShe plans to use the resulting income to cover the costs of her son\u2019s education and to expand her business further.\r\n\r\nThe microfinance institution Bai Tushum & Partners offers loans to socially vulnerable populations through Kiva. Bai Tushum & Partners ia a leading microfainance organization in Kyrgyzstan. Bai Tushum & Partners is a reliable financial partner which contributes to the economic growth of the Republic ofKyrgyzstan by providing affordable microfinance services in rural areas as well as in cities, thus helping  create jobs and serving the interests of its clients of investors.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":794551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Voznesenovka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-06-19T05:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khalila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":25462.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722445},{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":25462.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276816083}],"funded_date":"2011-06-19T21:04:27Z","paid_date":"2012-05-16T08:15:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":312646,"name":"Shrijana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shrijana is 26 years old. She is married and has one child, age 2. In 2006, she established her business raising cows. Working 7 days a week and 5 hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to purchase a cow.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Shrijana plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":803015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-06-30T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shrijana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":900.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221743321},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-19T08:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":901.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227594783},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":832.99,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-24T08:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":900.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233265721},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":833.01,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":900.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691523},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":901.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647888},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":832.98,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-25T09:09:03Z","rounded_local_amount":900.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865020},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":833.02,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:03Z","rounded_local_amount":900.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275005},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":901.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416471},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":832.97,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-23T08:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":900.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270131272},{"amount":24.95,"local_amount":1663.03,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-27T08:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1798.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947075},{"amount":12.24,"local_amount":837,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":905.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"payment_id":283296468}],"funded_date":"2011-06-30T21:49:01Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":316743,"name":"Huong's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Huong sells cooked food like sausages, rolls and roast duck in the market.
