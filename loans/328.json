They are all from the city of Masaya and live in the Monimb\u00f3 neighborhood.  They decided to work with Adim because they heard the promotion for poor women with small businesses.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Lourdes  del Socorro is the coordinator of the group. She's a young woman, age 33, married and the mother of a nine year old daughter in elementary school near the market.  After her classes, the daughter helps her mother with her business.  Her business is the sale of perishable goods in the municipal market in the firewood market on the outskirts of the market.  For many years, she's dedicated herself to this activity.  She's known for her association with her mother who sells in the same sector.  The products that she offers include: lettuce, tomatoes, cabbage, carrots, potatoes, etc. (these are the ones that have the most movement en her inventory).\r\n\r\nShe buys in the same market in the wholesale sector.  She buys these products with the other women of her group and in this way she gets the reductions in price.  Her workday begins at 3 am and ends at 3pm.  She has had her own house for a year which she just finished setting up a few months ago.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a market trader but of products like watermelon, melon and bananas.  For some years now, they have sold their products together.  Now she is becoming independent because this way she can buy what she wants with her profit.  He helps her with the house expenses and their daughter's schooling expenses.  She manages her own money and feels she has improved her condition as a person and economically, while having more rights at home.  She says that in Adim, they have learned the value of work and that their business is hers, just like her accomplishments.  All of this motivates her group-mates to fulfill their payment.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julie Lutz, Kiva

She earns P2,500.00 every week from this business, augmenting her regular salary as a storekeeper at a nearby water refilling station. Working at the water refilling station also provides an opportunity to market her products (see picture of Dionesia inside the water station with her products).\r\n\r\nWhile most of the loan she has

In the small town of Libertad, with her three children, whose ages range from four to eight years old, and her loving husband, Daizy dreamed of having a life that is simply happy. Instead of focusing on negative thoughts and emotions brought about by poverty, as a mother and a wife Daizy knew that she served as the light for her family, especially for her children, to keep from succumbing to the trials of life. She tries to see opportunities that life can offer them beyond being poor. Though she discovered a lot, it was in 1997 when she found the greatest of all. That was when she became a member of ASHI, a Kiva field partner in the Philippines. \r\n<p>\r\nThrough ASHI, Daizy has been able to obtain credit and has started her own small business. Over time, the loan amount she qualifies for has increased, as her hog-fattening business has grown. The larger the volume of hogs she sells (either alive or slaughtered--the pork is sold per kilo after four months of fattening), the more she profits. Daizy's business proceeds since then have been a great provider of food and other basic commodities her family's needs. She is no longer dependent on her husband\u2019s sporadic and small income; instead she takes part in earning money. \r\n<p>\r\nDaizy has been so happy with her achievements since obtaining membership in ASHI because she feels that she has helped not just her family but also people who live in their inaccessible village. The pork and pigs she sells has brought people convenient access to food. Therefore, Daizy would like to request another loan, which she will use for growing her business. That way she will be able to increase the number of hogs she is raising and selling, and increase the profits which improve her family's

Manab\u00ed.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Norma is married and has 7 grown sons, 2 of whom are married.  She works out of her home along with her husband, who is helping her with the loan which she requests.  \r\n\r\nFor ten years they have worked in the business of bricks, and the loan which they request is to invest in their familiar trade of making bricks.  The eldest of her sons helps her at home, preparing food for the workers who make the bricks for their company.\r\n  \r\nTo make bricks, Se\u00f1ora Norma's husband and their workers load their brick-baking oven with a base mixture of dirt, sawdust and water, which they grind together and put in a mold, where they leave it to dry in the oven.  They have 3 workers, who are paid an amount that corresponds to the amount of bricks they sell.  They sell their bricks in Portoviejo, and make contracts with construction companies, requiring them to produce 10,000 bricks per month.  They charge 80 dollars per thousand bricks, and when it does not rain, their sales go down, since there is less water to use for producing bricks.  They sell all the bricks that they are able to bake.  Se\u00f1ora Norma is the one in charge of preparing food for the workers who produce the bricks for their business.  Everyone tries to begin working by 4 a.m., because at that hour they can work in the open air without having to protect themselves from the harsh mid-day sun.  It is difficult work, requiring the sacrifice of comfort, and they have worked hard at it for 10 years.  With this newest loan, they will purchase materials to build a new oven, which will be firing bricks from Tuesday to Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":532817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Para comprar materiales para construir  horno para ladrillos","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-03T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1045,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":130.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":393.77,"local_amount":391.89,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":393.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709091},{"amount":262.51,"local_amount":261.26,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":262.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892391},{"amount":393.72,"local_amount":391.85,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":393.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632752}],"funded_date":"2010-05-05T09:21:35Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":201636,"name":"Maximo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"M\u00e1ximo tiene 55 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene 4 hijos ya adultos.

He\u2019s married and has 4 children who are already adults. They live together in the settlement of Rosario, located in the beautiful jungle of Ayacucho, where they have their own home. Two decades ago, there was a social and economic crisis, due to which they were living on meager means. Sometimes they had nothing to eat. For this reason, M\u00e1ximo, feeling very young, decided to cultivate his parent\u2019s land, which was not being used. With time, he began to involve himself in this agricultural activity, specifically the production and commercialization of coffee. Since then, he has loved to be in the fields. Today, he has a many hectors, where he produces in mass, with the goal that he can satisfy his potential buyers. In general, the products are sold in wholesale markets in his community. Normally, he receives help from his children during the harvest, but usually he works for himself, beginning at 7 in the morning and working until 6 in the evening. In the future, he plans to remodel their home, in order to increase his family\u2019s comfort. This is his second loan with MFP, for which he promises to follow the payment schedule. Furthermore, he is grateful to the institution for the accessibility and trust that they have allowed him. With the loan that he requests, he will invest in the purchase of fertilizer and other consumables for his coffee plantation.

We also begin to have financial and moral satisfaction for all of the efforts and sacrifices, and only then do we begin to understand the meaning of our work.

Jalilah hopes to expand her clothes business, sell more product, and generate profit in order to help support her family.  \n\n\nNote to lenders: \n\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  \n\nThese loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

She lives together with her husband and her four children.\r\n\r\nYolanda's business is selling clothes and accessories for babies, small children and adults.  She has been in this business for more than six years.  She makes her sales from a stall in the street market in her town.  She also sets up her stall when there are street markets in other towns.  Right now, she makes her sales as an itinerant street vendor and has an awning that she uses to temporarily set up her sales stall.  Yolanda tells us that her business is profitable because she buys her merchandise wholesale directly from clothes factories.  This is where she is able to obtain the best variety of products at the lowest prices.\r\n\r\nYolanda found out about MFP loans through a family member.

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Larrea lives with his wife and their thirteen-year-old son in Villeta, Paraguay. Together they run a small wooden stand from which they sell fast local-food favorites, such as empanadas, sandwiches, and milanese. They have had this stand for eleven years. A year ago, they began working with the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya, which utilizes programs like Kiva to give mico-financing to small business owners like Pedro and his wife. <p>\r\n\r\nSince their first loan, they have been able to paint their stand. Though otherwise a small achievement, paint is quite expensive, and the loan has allowed them to accomplish this without making sacrifices that would hurt business. In their newly-refurbished stand, they are doing better than ever. However, the couple tells us that they must get up at 3am daily in order to commute into the city and stock their stand. They are forced to shop in the nearby supermarket, though slightly more expensive, because it is the only store open at that hour.  Additionally, all merchandise must be carried to the store for lack of other transportation.<p>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Pedro and his wife would like to buy a van. The van will allow them to transport their goods with greater ease and purchase more at one time. Also, they want to start a delivery route.  As he continues to improve his business and his life, Pedro tells us that his dream is to open a store closer to his home and to earn enough money to ensure the education of his son. It is important to Pedro and his wife that he have the opportunity to become a professional and not have to sacrifice as they do. <p>\r\n\r\nThe money will go toward purchasing flour, eggs, meat, and

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

children.  She did not attend college, but instead began selling small items in the market.  For almost 20 years she has sold fruit at the Panchshanbe central market. Her son keeps them supplied, while her daughter helps to sell fruit and vegetables.  Her stall is located at an optimum place at the center of the market.  Saodat has collaborated with MicroInvest since 2007.  Her fruit is in great demand as vitamin deficiencies are common and everyone buys from her.  Her son assists her by bringing in the produce from Uzbekistan.

Be an important part of the growth of Mahmud\u2019s business.\n \nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 42, single, and the mother of 2 children who are 15 and 12.  They both go to school.  She never went to school.  She lost her parents very early and never had anyone to support her.  She lives in her own home with her children and her nephew who lost his parents.  She moved from Matola to Boane over 10 years ago because she had obtained a space to build her home.  She currently is a merchant and has owned her own business for 12 years.  She doesn't have employees and her children always help her when she needs it.  She sells used clothing and earns between 1,000 and 2,000 meticais a day.  She saves money through a traditional rotating savings system known as Xitique.  She has never had a loan with another bank.  She became familiar with Hluvuku because it is near the bank where she works.  This is her 7th loan and it is for 25,000 meticais.  She will use it to buy bundles of used clothing to diversify her products even more and satisfy the market.  Her previous loans were for 3,200, 5,000, 5,000, 8,000, 15,500, and 20,000 meticais and were all used for the same activity.

She lives on a farm with her husband, Fray Araya Mas\u00eds, and their son and daughter. Their farm is located in the rural region of Turrialba, in the central valley of Costa Rica. Noily has a small business producing and selling cheese. Fray works on a local sugar cane farm as an agricultural labourer. This will be Noily\u00b4s second loan from Fundacion Mujer. Her first loan, for 100,000 colones, was paid back, on time and in full, in only six months. \r\n\r\nNoily has been producing and selling cheese for 2 years. She started her business with an investment of 600,000 colones. She owns 4 cows and can extract 15 litres of milk per day from each cow. Depending on the quality of milk, 15 litres can yield 2-3 kilograms of cheese. Cheese production is an intricate process that requires attention to detail at every step to ensure a quality product. Because cheese is easily contaminated, Noily must invest in expensive bacteria-fighting chemicals. Noily has found it challenging to manage this necessary cost. In a good week, she produces and sells 45 kilograms of cheese. At 1400 colones per kilogram, this translates into 250,000 colones per month. In a bad month, she might earn 140,000 colones. \r\n\r\nNoily is applying for a loan of 350,000 colones to buy another cow so she can increase her weekly cheese output. Her long term goals are to buy more cows and improve the cheese-production process by creating a workshop separate from her house. At the moment, Noily's kitchen doubles as her cheese-production facility. Noily also wants a line of credit from Fundacion Mujer. This loan is a step in the loan process to qualify Noily for a line of credit.\r\n\r\nRural areas, such as Turrialba, are characterized by many difficulties, such as a lack of job opportunities, infrastructural deficiencies, low levels of formal education, and lack of available financial services. The highest level of formal education Noily has attained is the completion of primary school. Nevertheless, she has developed her talent for the art of commerce. Noily has arranged for a distributor from San Jose (the capital of Costa Rica) to pass by her farm every week. This distributor purchases all the cheese that Noily and her son have been able to produce. The cheese distributor travels from Turrialba to San Jose, where he sells the cheese to various restaurants and shops. \r\n\r\nThe field consultant who has been working with Noily for the past 2 years has described Noily as shy, sincere, and hard working. Loans from Fundacion Mujer have helped her to overcome personal obstacles in periods of depression. Running her business and the resulting relationships she has formed have helped her and her family significantly.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1980's, in an effort to fight the plague of poverty, the Costa Rican government decided to allocate land to impoverished citizens. The Institute of Agricultural Development (IDA) is the governmental body responsible for the selection and approval of citizens for land allotments. Many IDA land recipients, although grateful for the government\u2019s efforts, lack the necessary funds, as well as agricultural know-how, that would allow them to use their lands in an efficient and productive manner. Noily and her family were allocated land because they met the criteria for extreme poverty. Despite her entrepreneurial spirit, Noily's efforts have been hamstrung due to her exclusion from the traditional banking system. \r\n\r\nThis is where you can help. Your loan is a direct investment to improve the living conditions of a family living in a poor community of central Costa Rica. By lending to Noily, a proactive and hard-working entrepreneur, you are enabling her to take the first steps on a path that leads to the end of

Karim is an agricultural producer who has been working in this sphere of business for eleven years. He is a family man and feels responsible for supporting his three children who need help with their education. His wife is a very hardworking woman who also supports him in his production activities in order to improve their lives and be able to go on with their family life. \r\n\r\nAware of the needs his family is going through, Karim requested and received a loan from IMON International three years ago. He used that loan to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer for his harvest. Karim comes to IMON International today again to ask for a loan that may allow him to go on with his business and give his very beloved family the support they deserve.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in Quimbiri, located in the lovely jungle near Cuzco, in their own house. Sonia recognizes that it is not easy to get ahead financially when you have a child. She was thinking about studying for a career, but when her son was born, she began working in agriculture. \r\n\r\nHer first product was cocoa, and the sales provided enough money to cover the household expenses. Today, Sonia produces and sells cocoa, coffee, and corn. She has made a place for herself in the market, as her customers are very satisfied with the quality of the products. Sales are up compared with last year, thanks to the help of her husband who works together with her as a team. They also hire workers to help at harvest time.\r\n\r\nNormally, they sell their product in the markets of their community at a competitive price. Their future plans are to remodel their house with good materials, with the goal of improving the quality of life for their family.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food & daily use products in the local community.

Manuelina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Manuelina is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Manuelina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

He lives in Barranquilla with his partner and their two children ages 12 and 14. He started with over 13 years of experience from working as an employee at a food market in downtown Barranquilla. After that, he and his sister started up a store which they ran for a few years, until he decided to become independent and start his own venture, taking advantage of this experience which he now applies to his business.

With this loan obtained from Kiva, he plans to enter into the areas of disposable paper, pi\u00f1ata sales and candy sales.

Francisco Tlachichilpa.  I devote myself to raising cattle and taking care of my home.  I have no problems with my work because I have enough time to do the cleaning and cooking in my house as well as take care of my cattle.  My husband works in a butcher shop and this is where we sell the cattle. Eight days later, after the meat is sold, I collect payment for the cattle that I sold them.  I always have customers for my cattle.  This loan will enable me to buy more cattle and feed to fatten them.  I think that I will have more income for my family and be able to buy more household items.  My goals are to earn more return on my money and to provide a better quality of life for my entire family.  I am married and have 4 children who are students.  I want to give them a better education so they will have a better future.  I am 34 years old and have been married for 12 years.

The happily married, principled and down-to-earth father of two says he has been in this business for a decade now. \r\n\r\nTen years has been a time frame long enough for him to make his deductions on how to survive and weather the unpredictable storms such business come with. He has also learned to be philosophical in the face of financial and other operational adversity that plagues businesses. In many respects, this has been of paramount importance in his business operations as he has learned to strike a balance. \r\n\r\nMany of his clients are truck drivers who are being caught up in the construction boom that is pervading Mukono and its surrounding environs. By all accounts, Idd makes strong and durable bricks. He has built a good rapport with many of his clients. The strong and durable bricks are liked by many of his clients, who in turn prevail upon other people around Mukono to purchase durable and sturdy bricks from him. \r\n\r\nAs he casts his mind to the future, Idd knows the prospects for the future success of his business are good. Idd is also formerly employed as a teacher. Teaching is a profession he holds dear to his heart.

which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Khabibilla works as a lab technician at a local school, but, unfortunately, his salary does not allow him to cover family's expenses.  This is why he decided to start his own animal husbandry business at the beginning of the year in 2000.  Thanks to his tenacity and persistence, Khabibilla's business, started with a sum of 3,500 som (KGS), yields about 10,000 som (KGS) per month today from sales of dairy and meat products.  He sells his products on weekend livestock markets.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, Khabibilla requested a loan in the sum of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase additional heads of livestock.  He plans to invest the profits from the loan into a further increase of domestic livestock quantities in order to have an opportunity to pay for his children's education in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":955211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kok-Tash village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-21T17:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khabibilla","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":30219.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285453},{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":30219.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070942}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T04:20:56Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":377887,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is 40 years old, married to Mark and they have three children.

The preparation of different dishes and sandwiches has become her largest source of income since the orders that she has are continuous, which reflects her skill in the kitchen. She has been doing this for 6 years from her home, where she prepares the different orders to take them to the social events where she has been hired and which occur more often during the holidays. She tries to take advantage of them even if she goes without sleep some nights since her earnings are very high. In order to attract more attention from clients, she participates in different food preparation workshops and always learns new ways to season and present the dishes. In this way, Micerina tries to learn a little more each day, since her wish is to expand her social networks in order to increase her orders and make herself known throughout her district. Likewise, she wants to set up a store in her home where she can have an additional business that will help her maintain a stable income. With PRISMA Microloans, she already has 24 loans through her communal bank, which she formed more than 10 years ago with a group of friends with whom she continues to work well.

Makhsura is 35 years old. She is married and has a son. Makhsura's lack of a stable job and the slow productivity of her husband's business didn't leave enough money to pay the expenses of the home and of her little daughter. This was the reason that Makhsura decided to start her own business eight years ago, selling fabric for national dresses. Little by little, she has made her business grow and by offering installment payments to her clients, her orders are getting bigger. Now her business is running normally. However, she would like to continue bettering herself and her business. She is asking for a loan of $1,100 USD. With this money, Makhsura will be able to buy seasonal fabrics for national dresses. The power to help her business grow is in your hands.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is even able to save some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nGilberto never has had loans with other banks.  He found out about Hluvuku through institution officials who were conducting enrollment campaigns.  This is his 2nd loan, which has a value of 15,000 MZN.  He plans to use it to buy supplies (cooking oil, rice, sugar, etc.) in order to build up his business's merchandise.  He promises to pay back the loan on time so that he will be able to ask for others.  In the future, he intends to ask for more loans in order to improve his family's living conditions and to start raising cattle and goats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She earns her living by operating one business venture: pig fattening. Her husband Jose, who is 44 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have nine children who are between 4 and 25 years old. Lucia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lucia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as funds for her business operation so that she can continue to save for the future education of her children. Lucia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nGemma is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Gemma owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from tending a canteen near the school. Gemma has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gemma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gemma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Gemma is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional ingredients to cook more dishes and snacks to sell. This will be the 7th loan taken out by Gemma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The proceeds from this loan will help Selina pay her children's school fees.\r\n\r\nSelina faces the challenge of diseases which affect her production. In 5 years' time, she wants to have increased the number of her dairy cows to 4 and to have purchased a van for transporting her farm produce to the market.

For the last five years, Ana has managed a restaurant, with the goal of improving the well being of her son, who needs more care as he gets older.  Usually she begins working at 6 AM to prepare breakfast which she sell until 9 AM.  At that hour, she begins working on lunch which will be served at 2 PM.  A few hours later she begins working on dinner which will begin at around 7 or 8 PM depending on how sales are going.  The most difficult part of the work is that clients demand a lot of her time and attention, but overall Ana likes her job and that compensates for any inconvenience.  She is working with the well being of her son, who is the light of her life, in mind and would like to give him a brighter future.  With the money from this loan, she will buy new furniture for the restaurant to better attend to her clientele, expand her business, and improve her income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kahn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":213991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buying new furniture to improve the comfort of her restaurant for customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-15T18:40:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-29T21:16:58Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":216.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":217.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5336159},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":217.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957418},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":217.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227668},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":217.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422903},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":217.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116127},{"amount":70.85,"local_amount":216.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":217.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011087}],"funded_date":"2008-10-15T21:16:58Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kahn","image":986682}},{"id":73830,"name":"Joan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joan S. is a Tanzanian woman and SELFINA client who is 36 years old.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

He lives with his wife and a son. For more than 6 years, he has been involved in agricultural activities. He hires workers to work the land and gets help from his family with handling the money produced from the sales. \r\n\r\nLately, Abdujalil has expanded into raising livestock, which he also sells. He buys young cattle and cows, and when they are grown and heavy, he sells them. This is the first time that Abdujalil has requested a loan from IMON International. He has good references from his neighbors who consider him a responsible person. He requests this amount to buy seeds and fertilizer to grow wheat and onions on his land.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has a nephew who lives with her and helps her, and she has accepted the responsibility of sending him to school. Her most cherished dream is have her business earn enough so that she will be able to afford to send her nephew to college.\r\n<p>\r\nEmilia has always had an entrepreneurial spirit and an independent outlook on life. She is willing to invest her time, effort and money in a business, when she is sure that she will profit from it. She started earning a living by putting up a small <i>carinderia<\/i>, or luncheonette, adjacent to her house to serve meals to the locals. It became so popular that she was inspired to expand her services and began to offer coffee and snacks between meal times. In 2002, she became a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could have access to additional capital to expand her business because, as she explains, \"If you have a bigger investment [and] if you manage your business well, you will surely get a bigger return also.\"  Over time, Emilia has saved up and bought properties as an investment to secure her future.\r\n<p>\r\nAside from her luncheonette and cafeteria, Emilia earns additional income from two houses that she rents out. The smaller house is being rented by two students, while her bigger house is rented by a religious group. Emilia has been operating her carinderia and cafeteria for 32 years and she has been a landlord for only two. Her business nets her a profit of 4,000 pesos per month, which is enough for her living expenses, and she's been able to keep a good credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon for the seven years that she's been a member. Her previous loan of 19,500 pesos for her 11th loan was fully repaid on time without any delays in any of her weekly installments. \r\n<p>\r\nNow for her 12th loan cycle, Emilia is again borrowing 19,500 pesos to add to her working capital to ensure the sustainability of her business.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon!\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":393673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The rest are older and live independently.  \r\n\r\nSince she was young, she has worked in agriculture and she currently grows potatoes, peas, and gladiolus flowers with her husband.  She says that farm work is tedious, because it is a constant watch on each plant so that a plague of insects doesn't harm their crops.  Julia knows that if given proper care and fertilizer, you can expect a good harvest.  Additionally, the experience she has with planting has allowed to her to learn the necessary techniques for harvesting the entire crop without problems.  She likes her work very much because she gets to work with her husband and together they work to plant and later sell everything to wholesale merchants in the city.  The sales give them a regular income that allow them to live comfortably with their daughter.\r\n\r\nSince she is a very hard-working woman, she plans to increase her gladiolus flower and pea production since the prices of those items are very good at the market.

He lives with his wife and one of his four children who helps him in his business. He has a carpentry shop in his house where he makes furniture in all varieties and styles, however the client likes. He also repairs furniture items that he finds in poor condition, making them look like they just came from the store. His wife and his son assist him in this and they are a great help to him. He has been working in carpentry and cabinetmaking for 15 years. He likes this profession because it allows him to have a tranquil life and to demonstrate his artistry and creativity.

SPBD's loans are Vagana's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vagana Pilato are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She and her husband work on their small farm for the education of their 4 children.  She is dedicated to agriculture.  From girlhood, she has had two hectares of citrus plantations and 2 years ago she planted bananas also in two other hectares.  In the morning hours she prepares both breakfast and lunch, and thus gives herself time to go to buy merchandise for her small convenience store, where she is occupied in times when the small farm does not require as much attention.  What pleases her is harvest time for the bananas, which is every 15 days, since it is easy and does not take a lot of time.  And at the same time the most difficult thing is that she does not have a means to transport them to the market, so she has to accept the price that the buyers that come to the plantation will give her.  This is her first loan.  With this money she will hire laborers so that she can remove all the grass from her lands.  They charge her 270 soles per hectare.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":224220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To pay laborers to remove the grasses from her lands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-12T03:40:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989281}],"funded_date":"2008-11-12T14:17:02Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"B Brown","image":120650}},{"id":77958,"name":"Mayra Delia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Mayra Delia tiene 23 a\u00f1os a\u00f1os, pertenece al Banco Comunal Mujeres al Poder y vive en la calle Jos\u00e9 de la Riva Ag\u00fcero 261 B, distrito El Porvenir, provincia de Trujillo, departamento de La Libertad, Per\u00fa.\nEstudi\u00f3 secundaria completa y continu\u00f3 estudios de Computaci\u00f3n, pero ahora vive con su pareja y a\u00fan no tiene ni\u00f1os.\nSu negocio consiste en la elaboraci\u00f3n de manualidades, en sociedad con su cu\u00f1ada,  elabora sorpresas para cumplea\u00f1os y para el colegio.\nCon este cr\u00e9dito de S\/. 300, el cual ser\u00e1 cancelado en 4 cuotas, comprar\u00e1 materiales como pegamento, corrospun, tela de seda, etc.\nMayra sue\u00f1a con tener un gran taller que abastezca la venta de sus materiales que confecciona.\n","en":"Mayra Delia is 23 years old and is a member of the Communal Bank \"Women In Power\".

The loan is for investment in her business like buying fabric, needles, and replacement parts for her sewing machine.\r\n\r\nOrbelina dreams of continuing this business because she depends upon its income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":260621,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-05-27T15:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orbelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956939},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055669},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599855},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035744},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948142}],"funded_date":"2009-05-27T20:02:30Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T21:38:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":114822,"name":"\u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N. \u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb (435970112) is a 39-year-old female living in the town of Kim \u0110\u1ed9ng.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.
