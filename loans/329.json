She lives independently in her parents' home and longs to be able to give her beloved son a good occupation.  Nora walks around the Tupac Amaru market (an important market in the city of Juliaca) selling CDs from a small cart she transports all her stock, covering the entire market in search of customers to buy her CDs.  She has lower prices than other vendors and because of this many people prefer to buy from her.  Nora longs to have a little stall in the market where she can sell her goods without having to walk so much as that is what she likes the least about her work.  She has been in this business for 10 years and she enjoys speaking with her clients whom she always treats pleasantly and always convinces to buy a CD.  Nora has already had five loans from MFP and has repaid all of them on time because she wants to continue to receive loans.  She is well respected by her community bank because she is one of the members of longest standing.  She will use the loan to buy more CDs to increase her stock, which will cost her roughly 500 soles; with the rest of the monies she will make improvements to her cart and buy some items to help her sell better.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":275795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Movie Tapes & DVDs","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase her stock of CDs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-21T01:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117133},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012046},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595632},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989893},{"amount":54.31,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211025},{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":175.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640522}],"funded_date":"2009-02-21T08:15:46Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":94730,"name":"Rin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rin R. is 39 years old and resides with her husband in Siem Reap, Cambodia.

SPBD's loans are Solotua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Solotua T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She chose this business because agricultural production is the main economic opportunity in Arapy.  She wants a loan to purchase fuel for the wheat harvest and for cattle feed.  Aghavni expects this expansion of her business to increase the family income by 25%.  With these funds she will be able to pay the tuition fees for her children\u2019s education.

The official name of this borrowing group is Elonita S. group.\r\n\r\nElonita is single. To make a living, Elonita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Elonita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Elonita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elonita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elonita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Elonita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

When it comes to family life, success depends on how each partner cooperates and supports the other in all endeavors. \r\n<p>\r\nRosalie P. has always been open to new opportunities that come her way, especially in business. She is always on the lookout for new possibilities where she could use her skills and business acumen. Because she is not afraid to work hard to achieve her goals, she has already accomplished a lot in her 46 years. \r\n<p>\r\nRosalie is married to Pedrito, who is a councilor in their village. Even though he is active in local politics, Pedrito is also an active partner in their hollow blocks factory. \r\n<p>\r\nThey have four children. The two older ones have already earned their college degrees, and the younger kids are still in school. Rosalie's immediate aspiration is for her two remaining children to finish their studies and for their hollow blocks factory to continue to flourish, enabling them to provide employment to more people in their community in Brgy. Cabatangan, Talisay City, Negros Occidental.\r\n<p>\r\nRosalie's financial situation today is so much improved from her life years ago. Her first business was a &quot;sari-sari&quot; or general store where she sold just a few items. She was very frugal in budgeting her income, making sure that she set aside some of the income to increase her working capital, but she realized that she could not expand her business if she did not have access to outside capital. This is why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in June of 2002. With the additional capital, she was able to increase her income capacity by adding more items to her goods for sale. Later, she also started selling Ready-to-Wear clothes, and then added a Water Refilling Station to her roster of services. With the additional businesses, she hired people to help her in the business. \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she was given the opportunity to start a Hollow Blocks Factory, she did not hesitate, because she knew that this would not only help her family, but also provide work opportunities for people in their village. All her business activities now earn a minimum of $293 a month. She saves most of her income for the education of her children and their household expenses. In her previous loan she borrowed 35,000 PHP which she used as working capital for her business ventures. Now that she is into her next loan cycle, she wants to borrow 38,000 PHP so that she can buy another hollow-blocks machine and increase her production capacity.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":430910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

Such shows responsibility and industriousness, and the group is very grateful for the economic support and trust provided by the parties involved.  Most of the members sell products such as food, clothes, domestic appliances, cosmetics, and alcoholic beverages.  Some members proviD. domestic services.  The group's President sells typical fare such as majaditos (a regional rice dish), patasca D. trigo pelado (wheat with jerked beef) and soup in the market from very early till late.  Therefore, she has very little time to spend with her children.  She hopes to spend more time with them, by focusing on lunch sales only, thereby increasing her earning potential.  However, at present, providing her children with an education and a roof over their heads takes priority.  As is the case with Sarah, many of the group's members also have to leave home to work.  However, such is the price they pay for household upkeep and to improve the lives of their children.  The purpose of the loan is to buy consumables, utensils and other necessary products in order to generate a higher income for the members' households.  The members' greatest wish is to be able to proviD. a stable home for their children as most of the members rent accommodation or live in 'anticr\u00edticos' (a particular type of renting) and are constantly having to relocate in search of a new place in which to rent.  Therefore, members have to work to be able to purchase a property or build on plots of land, which some have already managed to buy and which will proviD. a better life for their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Justine Raymond, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":480362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To generate business income ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-02-02T10:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Orlando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2135.94},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2160.51},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.37},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2210.52},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2235.96},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2261.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2287.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.04},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2340.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2367.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.08},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":319.3},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.97},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":326.69},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.09},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":936.26,"local_amount":6481.82,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6525.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909437},{"amount":319.3,"local_amount":2210.52,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2225.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909438},{"amount":322.97,"local_amount":2235.96,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2251.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945013},{"amount":326.69,"local_amount":2261.69,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2277.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945014},{"amount":1002.49,"local_amount":6940.32,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6987.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673346},{"amount":0.3,"local_amount":2.09,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707368},{"amount":341.99,"local_amount":2367.6,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707369}],"funded_date":"2010-02-05T22:47:57Z","paid_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Justine Raymond","image":null}},{"id":177179,"name":"Kunthea's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. N.

Five of the children are currently attending school. David is a dairy farmer from Litein town in Rift Valley, Kenya. He has been farming for 26 years. His farm produces milk, which is sold to the local market. He also earns income from his small-scale farming of tea, which is also sold locally.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Maria wants to be able to afford to educate her children beyond High School and start them on a good career.  She leaves home very early in order to tend to her stall from which she sells clothing in the Mercado Bellavista (an important market in the city of Puno).  Every day she takes care of customers who come to buy:  she greets them in a happy manner and is very attentive to them.  The hardest part of Maria's job is bringing the clothing from Bolivia as the trip is very long and exhausting.  Nevertheless, she continues firm in the conviction that she will have a larger store in the future, a store where she will be able to offer a greater variety of clothes as her favourite thing is to sell and she is very convincing.  She has had this business for five years now, which has allowed her to give her children a decent life.  This is Maria's first loan with MFP and she is already saving in order to repay the loan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is not employed, so her entrepreneurship produces her primary income. Shoista is 47 years old, married, and has four children. Her oldest son is away working in Russia.

She owns a business venture, selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Ofu has many years of experience in this business.  Ofu needs a loan of WST $2500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Ofu joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ofu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ofu V. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her elder son works in a private company on a monthly wage while the younger one runs a barber shop.\r\n \r\nMusharaf has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, her husband will buy another buffalo to increase sales. She hopes that, with the additional buffalo, her husband will have a better financial outcome and that soon he will open his own shop in the market where he can sell milk to his own customers.  \r\n\r\nMusharat is a regular loan user of Asasah and is in her 2nd loan cycle. In previous loan years she has proved herself a responsible person who has never missed a meeting and has paid her installments on time.\r\n \r\nNote: \u201cIn the picture, the lady who is raising her

To make a living, Porferia owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as canned goods, snacks, breads & candies in the local community. She is also planting and harvesting flowers in the season. Porferia has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Porferia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Porferia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Porferia is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like biscuits and beverages. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Porferia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

born on March 21st, 1969. After divorcing her husband, she was left with two children. She decided to become an entrepreneur to support her family. Since she had already worked in the regional Consumer's Association, she had experience in sales. She rented a booth in the central market in the town of Vahdat to sell perfume. Gaining experience as an entrepreneur, Guljamol used the money she earned to expand her line of products.

With this loan, Margaret plans to invest in her provisions store.  More specifically, she will add off-licence to the provisions store, purchase two phones for her callbox (telephone booth) business, firewood and raw foodstuffs.  \r\n \r\nThis is Margaret's fifth loan; she has been a member of GHAPE since September 21st, 2004. She has a great deal of experience in her provisions store business; added to that, she will be selling wholesale as well as retailing.  Over the years, her customers have increased on a regular basis. She also feels that she has an excellent site for her business. \r\n\r\nLast year Margaret was emotionally disturbed when her house was scattered by the council, and she had to carry her family to beg a house and sleep inside. Finally, Margaret was seriously attacked by thieves and carried everything in her provision store from which she struggled to recover.\r\n\r\nShe plans to repay the loan in 24 months and the first installment of repayment shall be made on the fourth month from the date of disbursement.\r\n\r\nThe profit from this loan will be used to pay her children's school fees.  She will also invest much of her profit back into her business.  The rest will be used to clothe her children well, provide medical assistance for her family, and feed her family.  \r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n \r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":251685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of corn, beans, groundnuts, oil, and firewood, call centre","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ngomgham, Bamenda, NW.

Her husband earns an income as a \u201cjabal-jabal\u201d (single motor vehicle for hire) driver. Although he earns an average income of 150 PHP a day, it is not enough to support the family and that is why Mrs. R. undoubtedly engaged in business. She opened up a little sari-sari store and for 2 years she has been able to sustain her business. She is now earning an average net income of 1,500 PHP a month. With good luck, she was also elected as a Barangay Councilor and earns an average honorarium of 3,000 PHP a month, which is so helpful. \r\n\r\n<p>With her good reputation in Barangay and her good credit repayment record, Mrs. R. was given the privilege to obtain a first loan of 5,000 PHP. She is now applying for a loan in the amount of 20,000 PHP to add to her capital for her sari-sari store. The future income from this loan will be used to meet the family's daily needs, for loan repayment and for savings. Mrs. R. is hoping that someday her children will finish their studies right up to college, for their good future.\r\n\r\n<p>About PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

It is a dream for most Filipino parents like Carolyn as she herself is a college undergraduate and believes that this is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nCarolyn operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines and, while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic and paper. They sell these to junk shops like Carolyn\u2019s for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her to continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php15,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as the business expands. \r\n \r\nCarolyn dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through her hard work in her business.

Most people work to make their living so they can afford food, housing, and education for their children. People need some physical and mental exercise for healthy living. The essential fact is that your style of life depends on your  work.   <p>\r\n \r\nJyparkan A., the leader of the group, is 34, married, and has one daughter. Eight years ago, in order to use an inheritance profitably, she started her own business.  Since then, the family has worked hard with a well-deserved result: 4 cows, 8 sheep, and 35 goats. Jyparkan and her family now need a loan to clean a slaughter and prepare a coal supply for winter. Her most important goal is to increase the size of her cattle stock.<p>\r\n\r\nMirgul B. is the treasurer of the group. Although a very young married woman, she already has two small daughters. The main family income derives from the supply and resale of coal. The loan's purpose is to buy a car.<p>\r\n\r\nAskat M., 24 and married to a school teacher, has a baby son. Askat makes his living by coal supplying and its further resale. Making plans for the future, he intends to expand his business. <p>\r\n\r\nAzamat K., a 24-year-old bachelor, raises money by coal supplying and its resale in a neighboring region. The loan's purpose is to buy more coal for resale in the winter when it is most in demand. Next year, Azamat is planning to obtain a new house and get married. <p>\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She sells fruit such as bananas, apples and oranges, and vegetables. Her stall is well-stocked and popular with customers, which is why her merchandise sells very quickly.  What she likes best about her job is being able to talk with the neighboring vendors.  She has spent 3 years doing this activity and believes that the hardest part is having to stay all day at her stall, so she cannot spend the time with her family.  For the future, she hopes to have a larger store where she can sell her fruit in more comfort. \r\n\r\nThis will be her twelfth loan with MFP and she expects to be very punctual in paying her dues.

She now wants to restock her shop, buying sugar, washing soap, Vaseline, and bathing soap for more profits using the loan from Kiva.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":194354,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" to restock her shop ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2008-09-01T07:00:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bennah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Night","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ronald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Livingstone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-15T21:28:21Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":8100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2025000},{"due_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2025000},{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2025000},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2025000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1250,"local_amount":2025000,"processed_date":"2008-10-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-17T07:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2033800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":362547},{"amount":1250,"local_amount":2025000,"processed_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2033800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5344357},{"amount":1250,"local_amount":2025000,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2033800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9966471},{"amount":1250,"local_amount":2025000,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:48:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2033800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14882668}],"funded_date":"2008-09-01T21:28:21Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T14:48:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":66110,"name":"Duk","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is the second time Mrs.Duk S. has taken out a loan to improve her business.

However, their businesses are located in the main market of Masaya. They are from a humble background. They were not given the opportunity to attend school and they first learnt how to carry out rural activities, such as agriculture and the rearing of domestic animals. 5 years ago, Mrs Reina started her business selling vegetables from home, selling what she grew. She then realised that by obtaining a loan from ADIM, she could invest more money into her business. As a result, she formed the solidarity group JOSE and obtained a loan, which allowed her to set up a pitch in the main market of Masaya and which therefore enabled her to increase her profits. She began with a capital of $1,500.00 and now she manages 2 loans. One is a working capital loan and the other relates to her self-esteem. Both the loan from ADIM and the solidarity group JOSE have together helped Mrs Reina to overcome her fears and insecurities and have helped her to feel capable of confronting life. Her vision for the future is to expand her business and to obtain her own premises with better security. With the aim of fulfilling her dream, she proposes to continue repaying her instalments and intends to try and save money, so that she can improve her house and expand her business.         <br

Their average age is about 31 and they have an average of five children each. The Danaya group members live in traditional large extended families in the Dalan neighborhood of San (a town in the S\u00e9gou region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nThey got to know each other through neighborhood and family connections.\r\n\r\nThey all perform the same business activity: buying and selling used clothing and smoked fish. They are very much in demand in this business.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy the needs of their ever-increasing clientele, the Danaya group found a solution to their problems by joining the Soro Yiriwaso micro-finance institution with whom they are requesting their first group loan.\r\n\r\nThey intend to use this loan to buy bales of used clothing in Bamako (the capital on the Republic of Mali), and cartons of smoked fish in Mopti and San. The fish are sold separately for cash from home and in the markets around San.  As for the used clothing, it is sold at the San market, from home and door-to-door for cash or credit.\r\n\r\nDuring this loan cycle, each member of the group expects to make an average profit of 60,000 FCFA, which will be used to repay the loan interest, provide for the needs of the extended family and the remainder will be invested in the business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

During that time, Marifat has increased the range of goods she sells.  She has very beautiful and expensive goods, which are in high demand amongst young girls and women. Now Marifat would like to import a selection of European fabrics; however, she needs a large sum of money to do so.  Marifat has saved a certain amount, but she does not have quite enough.

Josefina has managed her store for almost five years, and she is ready to take the chance to further develop her business into a more progressive one. \r\n\r\nShe wants a loan from Kiva amounting to PHP10,000 for additional business capital. She is selling lots of bread, biscuits, and different commodities like coffee, sugar and salt. Also, she sells candies, canned and bottled goods and soft drinks. Josefina hopes that someday, with the support of Kiva lenders, her business will become ever more successful.

She enjoys this work as it takes her to various parts of the city, although the long hours of travel make it difficult.\r\n<p>\r\nSonia believes the best profit in her business comes from buying wholesale at low prices, with the option of repaying in small payments. This gives her possibility of selling a quantity of products rapidly without having to wait for them to arrive from a catalog order.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fiavaai joined SPBD.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

Every day she carries lunch to her husband who works as a bricklayer. When they were first starting out they had almost nothing, but after some time they decided to build themselves a house as best they could. Whenever her husband didn\u2019t have work he and Santa would put up the beams and walls of their house. Right now they are happy because the five years of dedication and sacrifice have given them a certain level of comfort, although the most difficult thing for her is not having an adequate space for her kitchen. Her greatest wish is to have the construction of her home finished. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she knows it will be highly beneficial for her to continue building her house. Therefore she commits to making all the payments promptly. She plans to invest the requested money in the purchase of tongue-and-groove boards (special boards used in construction) to enclose the perimeter of her house. In addition she would like to build a retaining wall with stones to prevent the erosion of the sand that borders her house. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Margaret Wolfe-Roberts,

The name was chosen for the enterprising women members and for the location of the group. The municipality is known for the businesses that are run mostly by young women, each with a tremendous will to improve the quality of life for their children and their family. The members' plan is to have the women on that municipality to have steady work, and to bring renewed development to the region. The members of the group all are originally from the State of Hidalgo. There are 11 members in the group. \r\n\r\nThe photo was taken in the house Maria Natividad G. V.. She is the treasurer of the group. A great harmony and collegiality exists among them. Natividad is 40 years old and she graduated high school. She is married and she has 3 children, 2 boys and a girl. She sells shoes through a catalogue and she has had the business for the past year. She requests a loan to invest in the purchase of shoes and new catalogues. Her wish is to not only sell shoes but also clothing to make more sales in less time. Her clients comment that Natividad is a very kind person and she provides great customer service. She sells her products at an accessible price and offers flexibility in payment methods, in cash or in credit with weekly payments, depending on the clients' situation. \r\n\r\nWhen she applied for the loan she was very happy to have the opportunity to improve her sales and to strive towards her dream of supporting her son as he readies for a career in Baseball. He currently plays in a league and his hard work has granted him a scholarship. He will continue his studies and his scholastic endeavors,\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4150,"image":{"id":608439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase merchandise to improve their business.

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Susan has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,500, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 to purchase stock for her food vending business so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Susan is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

Jose St., Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Cerilo S., a janitor, and is the mother of two children who are studying in college while the other one is already working. \r\n\r\nAt this time, she is working hard to be able to send her youngest child all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Susana, as she herself is a high school graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nSusana operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP\u2019s-worth of cooking oil or an egg. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail piece rates. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her variety store, she is requesting a 25,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages so as to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSusana hopes that her business will become bigger and she will be able to build a bigger commercial place. She also prays for having their own house and lot for her family. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group\u2019s weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n \r\n*All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis. The fellowship groups gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Z. is 28 years old, single and has no children. Her intention is to keep working since she has a long time to make headway and she would like to generate more income for her family. She provides for her mother and sisters. Her wish is to finish her studies because it is an opportunity her parents never had, and thanks to her efforts she is fulfilling her dreams of being able to offer the same opportunity to her future children. It's for this reason she must save for the future as well as establish a more stable business. <p>\r\nLissett makes a living selling clothing and cosmetics at an outdoor sales post, which she has been doing for six years. She started the business for her family because for a long time this had been their means of income but due to economic circumstances they were forced to give up the business. From this came the inspiration to decide to re-establish the family business on her own and regain their source of income. She chose to start out with just a few products, such as underwear and candy, and sold the products in The Terminal outdoor market. Her desires to make headway were ever stronger because she also had to repay the debts she took on to start it. Little by little she acquired the capital necessary to make progress with her business, and nothing came easy because she not only had to make the sales but also make the purchases. Only time helped her adapt to surviving in this line of work, to which she is now requesting a loan to purchase products such as cosmetics, clothing and school supplies since school season is nearing. She also needs to travel to Managua and Chinandega because those are the best areas to make these purchases.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":263598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase products such as cosmetics, clothing and school supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-31T00:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lissett Benita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":837.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400028},{"amount":65.72,"local_amount":1314.41,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1321.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092026},{"amount":17.61,"local_amount":352.25,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":354.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985409},{"amount":43.23,"local_amount":864.55,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":869.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446024},{"amount":40.11,"local_amount":802.11,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":806.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956663},{"amount":291.66,"local_amount":5833.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-16T18:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5863.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174086}],"funded_date":"2009-01-31T05:00:00Z","paid_date":"2009-08-16T18:00:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":90714,"name":"Touch","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"T. is 35 years old and runs a medium-size store out of her home, providing a service for buying and selling used-goods.

For each event that she decorates, she makes 40,000 to 50,000 Uganda shillings in profit. \r\n<p>\r\nFlorence has been running her decorating business since 1988. When she was in school, she realized that she really enjoyed working with flowers and other decorations. After graduating from high school, she worked in various jobs before meeting some women who were doing decorating. She joined with them to learn the trade and has now been working in her florist shop in the city of Kampala for over 20 years. Florence has four employees who help her decorate at the various functions for which she is hired. They help her arrange all the materials. \r\n<p>\r\nShe works with many media. She says that depending on the function, she might use dry, artificial, or real flowers. Besides flowers, she has many beautiful stands and papers that she uses to make everything look beautiful. \r\n<p>\r\nFlorence says that loans are what makes her business possible, because she finds that while each customer wants individual decorations, they do not pay ahead of time; therefore, loans allow her to do her work at the high level of quality she expects of herself. \r\n<p>\r\nFlorence has five children of her own that are still in school and five grandchildren that she supports.

She is 21 years-old and the group leader of a four member group loan offered by Kiva partner PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarifel is married and has one infant child.   Marifel owns and operates a business selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Marifel has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marifel joined Kiva partner PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marifel is requesting a first loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell.
