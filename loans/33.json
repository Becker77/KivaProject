Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

There are a lot of restaurants and rooms for rent to accommodate those university students. Apart from the need for food, living space and cultural exchange, getting on line is an undeniable necessity for the young crowd. Based on her market study, Ms Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Th\u00fay opened an internet cafe in 2003. Ms Th\u00fay is 57 years old, her 3 children are all grown up and have a job so she has to hire 2 employees to help her run the internet cafe. Having a good, friendly customer service keeps the cafe busy. Her husband, a retired military officer, helps her out when she is busy. The revenue for the internet cafe is about 350 USD \/ month minus salaries for the 2 employees at 50 USD \/ month. Ms Th\u00fay requests a loan of 575 USD to buy new equipment for her internet cafe.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nL\u00e0 m\u1ed9t \u0111\u1ecba b\u00e0n r\u1ea5t thu\u1eadn l\u1ee3i cho vi\u1ec7c ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n kinh t\u1ebf (g\u1ea7n tr\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc s\u01b0 ph\u1ea1m H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i 2) n\u00ean tr\u00ean \u0111\u1ecba b\u00e0n ph\u01b0\u1eddng Xu\u00e2n H\u00f2a c\u00f3 r\u1ea5t nhi\u1ec1u nh\u1eefng c\u1eeda h\u00e0ng \u0103n, ph\u00f2ng tr\u1ecd.

El presto en Afodenic para comenzar hacer la construcci\u00f3n  de su casa pero como el financiamiento es poco por  la disponibilidad que el cuenta,  solo logro comprar parte de los materiales de construcci\u00f3n ya que todo esta caro. Es por eso que con este financiamiento comprara m\u00e1s material como: bloques,cemento,tablas, clavos y otros para comenzar hacer las mejoras, ya que es dif\u00edcil en los tiempos de invierno para el, ya que se pasa el agua. Da las gracias por el apoyo ya que solo es posible esta mejora con el financiamiento ya que no cuenta con capital propio.\n\n","en":"\r\n\r\nGerardo, 54, is an unassuming, hard-working man.  His wife has a daughter, who is studying bookkeeping.  Gerardo is a bookkeeper and works independently.  This means that he works for several companies but at a very low pay rate.  Because he works for several, however, it adds up to enough to pay for food and some household expenses.  \r\n\r\nHowever, it has been very difficult for him to do any home improvements and his house is very unsafe.  He got funding from Afodenic to start building his house but, because the loan was small due to his eligibility limits, he was only able to buy some of the materials because everything is very expensive.  \r\n\r\nWith this new loan he will buy more materials like: concrete blocks, cement, boards, nails, etc. to start the improvements because Winter is an especially difficult time for him because water gets into the interior of the house. \r\n\r\nHe gives thanks for the support because these improvements are only possible thanks to the loans because he does not have his own capital.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

I could be my own boss.\u201d \r\n \r\nNot long after that, Edwin and his wife, Maria, started a family-owned janitorial and handyman repair business. Thirty years later, the business is still going strong and now employs two additional workers to help manage a wide variety of jobs that range from installing tile in houses to gardening to cleaning office buildings.\r\n \r\nThe couple\u2019s favorite part of running a small business is the flexibility it affords them. They work hard, but have the freedom to create their own schedule and spend more time with family. \u201cAs my own boss there\u2019s nobody telling me what to do \u2013 but that also comes with responsibility. You have to be disciplined. You can\u2019t afford complaints from clients,\u201d said Edwin.\r\n \r\nDespite 30 years of experience and their strong work ethic, the recession has presented a significant challenge to the business: \u201cWhen the economy is bad, things are tough, because people don\u2019t have extra money to spend on fixing their houses.\u201d \r\n \r\nIn order to secure more work, Edwin and Maria needed capital, but many of the places they initially looked charged interest rates pushing 90%. Fortunately, their search also led them to Opportunity Fund, a local micro-lender, where they were approved for a $750 micro-loan (with an interest rate of 8%). With their loan, Edwin and Maria will be able to take on an extra account and build their credit for larger business loans in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":764140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to take on an extra janitorial account and build their credit history.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Richmond, CA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":132,"posted_date":"2011-05-06T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin And Maria","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":121.76},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.87},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125.61},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":126.47},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":127.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.76},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.92},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.87},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":121.76,"local_amount":121.76,"processed_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-29T07:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":121.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211284829},{"amount":123.92,"local_amount":123.92,"processed_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-22T07:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":123.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217381941},{"amount":124.87,"local_amount":124.87,"processed_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:20:38Z","rounded_local_amount":124.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221734791},{"amount":125.61,"local_amount":125.61,"processed_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-27T08:20:54Z","rounded_local_amount":125.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227105071},{"amount":126.47,"local_amount":126.47,"processed_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-20T08:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":126.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232866404},{"amount":127.37,"local_amount":127.37,"processed_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":127.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238682476}],"funded_date":"2011-05-07T13:39:09Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T11:09:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":300157,"name":"Charles","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles, a 27-year-old married father of four children, has been selling curios along Kijabe Street in Nairobi for five years.

This way of life makes it possible for her to generate resources to help out her family since she\u2019s married and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen she is asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the health clinic.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2250,"image":{"id":813052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric and thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2011-07-16T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelica Maria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerson Efriain","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Arminda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susset Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betshabe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":15656.55,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1565.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.01},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.01},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225.01,"local_amount":1565.7,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1566.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221746234},{"amount":675.02,"local_amount":4697.1,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4698.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227115859},{"amount":450.01,"local_amount":3131.4,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3132.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232877514},{"amount":450.01,"local_amount":3131.4,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3132.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238694221},{"amount":449.95,"local_amount":3130.95,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3131.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244650255}],"funded_date":"2011-07-17T13:18:46Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":320645,"name":"Filma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Filma is a 42-year-old woman who is married and lives in Clarin, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

This is one of the most productive and popular activities in the city of Estel\u00ed, where she is from. She has two children, 18 and 14 years old respectively. They are studying, and are Maria's priority and she wants a better future for them.\r\n\r\nShe started her business selling 50 tortillas, a very small quantity, because she didn't have enough of the needed ingredients. Afterwards, her inventory increased because she gained additional clients. She also noticed that in small corner shops a lot of people were asking for tortillas, so she began selling her tortillas in these stores as well. This turned out to be a good strategy, and has become her second business. Before she worked sewing but she didn't make very much money. Selling tortillas is more profitable, so she decided to sell tortillas.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy wholesale firewood and maiz (corn), since she gets a better result by buying wholesale so as to get a good price for the materials, and produce more. One of her plans for the future is to hire employees so that they can help her make tortillas and satisfy part of her clients' demand, since she alone can't fill all of her orders. Her next goal is to make repairs on her humble home, starting in the kitchen--where she makes her tortillas. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":943417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy firewood and corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T02:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Dilia \t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":262.15,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.55},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.54,"local_amount":29.11,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":30.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257242703},{"amount":30.55,"local_amount":29.13,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:28Z","rounded_local_amount":30.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381975},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":29.13,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":30.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095505},{"amount":39.22,"local_amount":37.39,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:27:41Z","rounded_local_amount":39.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276710128},{"amount":21.9,"local_amount":20.87,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":21.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283403567},{"amount":35.97,"local_amount":34.29,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:47:17Z","rounded_local_amount":35.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287428516},{"amount":70.66,"local_amount":67.36,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":70.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294613236},{"amount":15.6,"local_amount":14.87,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":15.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452736}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T14:46:46Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:53:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Betsy McCormick","image":781553}},{"id":373948,"name":"Mamie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mamie lives in Buchanan.

is a group loan to be shared by the four members of the Ndigne group, led by Mr. Abdou D..  In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cBackground: The Ndigne group is located in the village of Louly Ngogom.  Situated in the interior of the country, Louly is an agricultural village that specializes in peanut farming.\r\n<p>\r\nPurpose:  To support the families of the village in between harvests, and improve living conditions.\r\n<p>\r\nActivities:  The business consists of buying sheep, fattening them and selling them at the weekly markets.\u201d \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nBackground <p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.<p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Business description translated from French by Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance Fund. <\/b> \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u00abContexte : Le groupement Ndigun\u00e9 est un groupement du village de Louly Ngokhom ; Situer au centre du pays,le village de louly est un village d\u2019agriculteur qui se donne surtout \u00e0 la culture de l\u2019arachide .\r\n<p>\r\nObjectif : Soutenir les familles en p\u00e9riode de soudure\r\nAm\u00e9liorer les conditions de vie \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nActivit\u00e9s : l\u2019activit\u00e9 consiste a acheter des moutons, les engraiss\u00e9s et les vendre dans les march\u00e9s hebdomadaires.\u00bb<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":55267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase and fattening of sheep for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Louly Ngogom","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.7333 -16.4167","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2007-08-22T18:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-05T22:34:31Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":425,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2007-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2007-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:34:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80012},{"amount":36,"local_amount":36,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:35:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93759},{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T20:58:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136679},{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2008-04-06T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":174652},{"amount":36,"local_amount":36,"processed_date":"2008-05-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201942},{"amount":36,"local_amount":36,"processed_date":"2008-06-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":229190},{"amount":36,"local_amount":36,"processed_date":"2008-07-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":258334},{"amount":36,"local_amount":36,"processed_date":"2008-08-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287104},{"amount":29,"local_amount":29,"processed_date":"2008-09-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-15T07:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":317386}],"funded_date":"2007-08-22T22:34:31Z","paid_date":"2008-09-15T07:16:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":20700,"name":"Salimata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salimata Kamagat\u00e9 is so professional, indeed.

M. is 44 years old. She lives in Corredores, in the southern region of Costa Rica, with her husband and four children. Maritza is in the textile business: she designs and produces shorts and pants by hand with her sewing machine. She started her business in November of 2006 with an initial investment of 700,000 colons ($1200 US) she sells her products from her home and from door to door in her neighbourhood. Her clothes are very popular, and at the moment she has more orders than she can keep up with. \r\n\r\nMaritza\u2019s main challenge has been securing a reliable and affordable supplier of raw materials. Currently, her supplier is located in San Isidro, which is close to her home, but the materials are expensive and delivery is unreliable. She knows a supplier in San Jose who is much more professional and affordable. Due to the longer distance and associated costs of distribution, the San Jose supplier requires a minimum quantity to be purchased with every order. Currently, she does not have enough capital to place a large enough order to satisfy this restriction. Maritza is applying for a loan of 500,000 colons, which will enable her to purchase larger quantities of materials from the source in San Jose. With your help, she will be able to purchase in bulk and take advantage of a lower price for the materials she needs. By switching suppliers, Maritza will increase her profit margins and use the income to improve her family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\nMaritza has a strong work ethic; she devotes the hours from 7am to 6pm to her textile business. On a good day she can produce 10 articles of clothing. Shorts sell for 2500 colons (around $4US) while pants sell for 4000 colons (roughly$7US). The majority of sales are done in cash, and in a good month she earns 500,000 colons. In a bad month, she only earns 60,000 colons.  After accounting for the costs of raw materials, rent and machinery maintenance, Maritza uses her revenues to support her family.\r\n\r\nMaritza dreams of opening her own store where she could offer a more diverse range of products.\r\n\r\nYour contribution is a direct investment in the improvement of the lives of families living in a poor community of southern Costa Rica.

Guillermo is a dedicated farmer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvesting of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. He works to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. In addition to his agricultural activity, Guillermo feels it is important to be an active member of his community. As a result, he dedicates a significant portion of his time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Guillermo lives is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Guillermo is working hard and striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labor. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Guillermo and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Guillermo. The production cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Guillermo planted his peppers four months ago and will expect to harvest in the next eight months. Typically, he dedicates the hours from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM everyday to his agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial (PROPICA) is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Guillermo and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Guillermo, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve living conditions for Guillermo as well as the community at large. Above all, Guillermo wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. He wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his home and neighborhood. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":618261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase agricultural chemicals and nutrients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Upala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T23:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guillermo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65568.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66661.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67770.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":132.93,"local_amount":66466.67,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":67623.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428402},{"amount":133.35,"local_amount":66676.02,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":67836.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970541},{"amount":133.72,"local_amount":66857.31,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":68020.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289986}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T15:52:00Z","paid_date":"2011-04-16T08:18:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":242802,"name":"Ngin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngin S. has been a farming businesswoman for a long time.

is 37 years old and married with 6 children.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maliumai joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Devina has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Devina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Devina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI. Devina is requesting a new loan, which will be used to purchase additional firewood to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Devina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement income of her family and support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With this loan, Mrs. S. is hoping to make a monthly profit of 35,000FCFA, which according to her will be reinvested in her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":618284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T11:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Binta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Barakissa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613632},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188752067},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606314},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917975},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360901},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226207}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T13:07:34Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":242818,"name":"Adelaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adelaida F. is  51 years old, married, and has two adult children and one child who attends high school.

Soon she gave a birth to three daughters and one son. Unfortunately, her family life was not happy and she was divorced from her husband in 1997. As Aiymbubu became the only breadwinner for her children, she decided to start animal breeding. Using an initial amount of 15,000 Kyrgyz soms, she bought one milk cow, whose milk she sold to the dairy factory. Later on, her livestock grew and in order to reduce her expenses for the livestock's foraging, she pastured her livestock in the mountainous areas with native grasses. Now, Aiymbubu has two milk cows, two horses and 15 sheep at her farm. On the weekends, Aiymbubu and her son sells meat at the local market. \r\n\r\nAs Aiymbubu is a very hardworking person, she is also engaged in sewing mattresses, cushions and coverings, which became very popular in her local area because of the low prices and good quality of her products. Now, Aiymbubu requests a loan of 50,000 Kyrgyz soms to buy two bull calves for fattening and reselling.  It allows her further development of her household and business. In the future, she plans to hold her daughters\u2019 weddings and give good dowries for them.

This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Her goals and aspirations are to start importing used shoes for her business and also to buy a plot of land to build her own house. \r\n\r\nHarriet lives in a home that she rents.

S., 45 is married mother of 3 children.

They earned enough to pay for their needs. Since <i>perestroika<\/i> both Hamira and her husband began to sell. Now, while her husband is away working as a seasonal laborer in the neighboring countries, Hamira is the one responsible for providing for her family and raising her children. While taking care of her daughters, Hamira managed to expand her business. She joined MicroInvest in 2003 and took the first loan of $90. Today, Hamira\u2019s line of credit reached $1400, which illustrates that Hamira has been a disciplined borrower since the beginning of her relationship with MicroInvest.

Very quickly she started a business to generate an income, more specifically,for the last three years, she has been selling firewood. For the last 3 years, she has had a relationship with the organization Soro Yiriwaso. After having completed 3 group loans (interdependent loans) with a neighborhood association, she is applying for her first individual loan. All the previous loans have been repaid  on time.<p>\r\nShe gets her firewood supply on Segou's plaza and sometimes in the surrounding villages (such as K\u00e9l\u00e9kou). She buys from farmers well known in the trade. She plans on using this loan to buy 5 truck loads of firewood.<p>\r\nShe sells from her home day and night (because she uses a space set aside where the wood is stored, sheltered form the rain).\r\nMrs. Fatoumata Traor\u00e9 sells retail and wholesale mostly to women and bakers who buy on credit that is repayable weekly. Her advantage in this business is that she has no competition because she is the only seller of firewood in her neighborhood. She is planning on making a monthly profit of 115.000 FCFA which will allow her to both repay the loan and invest the rest in her activity. Her ambition is to diversify her activity by opening a shop selling various items.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by V\u00e9ronique Fourment, Kiva

Calle 9-25 in zone 2 of Totonicap\u00e1n. He has been in business for over 13 years, making jackets, g\u00fcipiles (traditional Guatemalan dresses) and other traditional apparel in assorted styles and varieties. He sells his merchandise in Antigua Guatemala and Sol\u00f3la. A few years ago, he visited the Asdir office to request a loan in order to increase his capital and stock up on merchandise. With his previous loan, his business was able to grow financially and develop in a different way. Upon noticing that both his business and his family\u2019s standard of living have been improving on a daily basis, he once again feels the need to obtain another loan that will be invested in increasing his work capital and improving production. Because the town fair is approaching, he would like to be able to produce more and earn more profits for his own benefit. Furthermore, the end of the year is coming up, and with this loan he wants to display his work to the tourists who visit the country so that they can purchase our traditional clothing.<br

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her parents' house, and they have always supported her so she could be successful in life. She has a four-year-old daughter, and hopes to be able to give her a good eduction. From the wee hours of the morning, Yaneth sits at her stall in the Santa B\u00e1rbara market in Juliaca, selling cheeses. Her customers seek her out because she is a charismatic saleswoman and always offers them a small when they buy one of her delicious cheeses. She is somewhat shy, though, and we couldn't get her to smile for a photo. She's been working in the market 15 years, and what she likes best about her job is chatting with the women at the neighboring stalls. She wants to develop her business and better supply her stall. What she likes least is withstanding the intense cold inside the market, but she is nevertheless aware that she has to do anything she can to improve her quality of life. This is Yaneth's first loan with MFP, and she hopes to make all her payments on time, since she doesn't want to hurt the other members of her community bank, where she is cherished for the happiness she brings. She will use the requested loan to increase her working capital and be able to better supply her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":305660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase her business capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-24T17:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":155.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012472},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":155.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596062},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":155.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990326},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":155.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211449},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:36Z","rounded_local_amount":155.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640952},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":155.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080420}],"funded_date":"2009-04-24T18:01:06Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":106772,"name":"Essohazi Robert","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce monsieur  a pour activit\u00e9 le commerce de boissons locales  alcoolis\u00e9es appel\u00e9es \u00ab DEHA \u00bb, il exerce ce commerce depuis  2000, son anciennet\u00e9 fait qu\u2019il ma\u00eetrise bien ce commerce, il est mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de 02 enfants, c\u2019est cette activit\u00e9 qui lui permet de subvenir aux charges de sa famille.

Nargiza has a successful business selling high quality clothes for children. She is a very experienced entrepreneur who has been in business for seven years. She offers her customers polite service, reasonable prices and quality products. Nargiza is divorced and has three children. She has requested a loan of 4000 TJS to increase her business capital. This loan will allow her to continue investing in her business and pursue her future goals of expanding and opening new sales locations.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She cares for her mother in her own home, located in the hamlet of Cumutay. Marcelina sells basic staples in her store, where she opens her doors every morning very early to sell to the residents of her area. Since she is a very active woman, in the afternoons she takes care of her potato, corn and pea crops, which she has done for 20 years. In this time she was able to learn not only the techniques of cultivation, but also how to sell her crops at a good price. In her city's wholesale market, she is always the one with the most sales. Her hobby is caring for her animals-rams and cows. Now, Marcelina wants to increase her quantity of cows in order to be able to start making cheese. She knows that with her communal bank's help she will achieve this goal; they are upright and, above all, responsible people. She belongs to the \"Los Pioneros de Cumutay\" communal bank, and this is her ninth loan with MFP. She hopes for your collaboration in order to continue with her goals.

She also tells us that she sells seasonal fruit, fried foods, seeds and peanuts at a small table she puts in front of her house facing the street every day.  Her sales are good but when they drop, she puts what she sells into a bag and goes door to door.  She also goes every afternoon to another community to sell fruit in season.  She now prepares bags of nance which she sells at 10 Mexican Pesos (MXN) and she says that they sell well.\r\n\r\nShe needs this loan to invest in the purchase of disposable bags, seeds, fried foods, fruit, peanuts, chili powder, chamoy and lemons in order to make sales and sell her products.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a hardworking and optimistic woman who lives with her husband and 3 children, who are her greatest treasure.\r\n<p>\r\nSince her children are grown, Mar\u00eda looked for a way to help her husband with the household expenses.  She bought a mobile food cart that she situated in a temporary space in front of her home.  Mar\u00eda works every evening and most of her customers are her neighbors.  She has been in business for 5 years and, within a short time, has managed to capture people\u2019s attention and figure out what her customers like to eat.  Her business is profitable because she is able to purchase her supplies at a low price and prepare the food efficiently.  People have come to recognize the exquisite taste of Mar\u00eda\u2019s dishes.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer future plans include expanding her house so that she can open a restaurant.  It would be open in the afternoons and evenings, since this is when she sells the most food.

His usual itinerary is the Kanibadam-Khujand route. Zarif has about 5 years of experience in the public transportation field, and the competition is rather high in this business since there are so many people who need it. His current request is so that he can maintain his vehicle, since this is the tool of his trade. So now Zarif is counting on your help and requesting a loan of $1200 USD. With the loan he\u2019ll purchase the spare parts for his microbus.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In winter there is heavy snowfall in Kochkor. Everywhere it seems to be silent and only some sounds of cattle can be heard. However, there are people there. Children make snowballs and play games. Adults are busy with their livestock.  Along with everyone else, Asel K., the leader of the group, also deals with her housework, but what makes her special is her youth and determined character. She is a purposeful individual and seeks differences in her life. She is 27 years old, married, a marvelous mother of two children and a good wife. The older child is five and her daughter is two. Her husband works as a welder in an organization, but in his free time he helps in her business. In 2009, they took out a loan to buy cattle and then sold them. For money they have two calves which they are now fattening. They started with 20,000 KGS ($446). At present their revenue is 3,000 KGS ($66) per month. Their plan is to improve their life and be more comfortable by buying a big house. However, at first they want to get a loan to buy a horse to fatten which they would sell in summer. For profit they are going to gather in a harvest crop from the field which they have already bought. \r\n\r\nKubatbek A. is a married man aged 60. His wife is a pensioner. They have a son who helps them. They resell potatoes in the market and have already bought a car for 42,000 KGS ($940). They want to invest the loan to increase turnover which is currently 150,000 KGS ($3,400).\r\n\r\nAida J. K. is 34 and has three children. The elder two attend school and the youngest one is at home. Her husband is a member of a peasant household. She has a business which she began three years ago. She buys old pictures and remakes them for selling. She started with 5,000 KGS ($112) and her profit per month is 5,000 KGS ($112).  They have bought a car for 45,000 KGS ($1,004). She wants to get a loan to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nNurgul I. is 36 and the mother of four children. They all attend the local school. Her husband is a member of peasant households. They have bought a tractor for 50,000 KGS ($1,117). Now she fattens cattle. They began with 20,000 KGS ($446) and now the revenue is 3,000 KGS ($66). By taking out the loan they want to buy cattle to fatten and sell afterwards.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

(She is the one in the photo with her hand raised and her loan contract in hand, in the background).  She is a 4th loan cycle client, aged 46, widowed, and the mother of two daughters, both of whom have their own homes already.  The daughters are appropriately pursuing their education with the support of their husbands.  \r\n\r\nWidow Bubenga's husband died in 1994 due to his family's ignorance and carelessness. Bubenga says that, instead of going to get care at a regular hospital, her husband's family had favored taking her now deceased husband to a <i>f\u00e9ticheur marabout<\/i> (traditional practitioner), which complicated his health situation, leading to an early death. \r\n\r\nWidow Bubenga sells vegetables:  <i>sombe<\/i> (cassava leaves), spinach, amaranth, tomatoes, eggplant, etc.  She displays her produce at the small market of the Mapendo-Birere district and sometimes in front of warehouses or outlets.  \r\n\r\nShe started her small business with her own funds.  Her initial capital was $70.  Then, she was informed about the micro-finance institution Hekima, which lends to the poor without collateral.  From that, she got her first boost loan.  With the loan from the MFI Hekima, she would like to increase her sales by buying vegetables she will be able to resell.  \r\n\r\nThe big challenge she faces is variability; that is, there is a big difference in prices, such that, during the rainy season, prices plunge, given that vegetables are plentiful on the market.  During droughts, there is a shortage of vegetables.  Despite this, consumers (customers, people) will still buy, and Bubenga will derive as much profit as she can.  \r\n\r\nWidow Bubenga came to the decision to watch over her biological mother (her daughters' grandmother), who is now very old.  She remains at her side to attend to her and to care for more struggling orphans in her extended family.  As much as her sales are increasing, she would prefer switching her work to supplying <i>pagnes<\/i> (clothing of Congolese women) in the city of Bukavu, the capital of the province of Sud Kivu.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, Bubenga would like to build a house in the future on her parcel of land located in the outer district of Goma City, in Ndosho (Kiziba II), and then rent it out.  This would bring in money.  \r\n\r\nWidow Bubenga thanks the MFI Hekima for the loans she receives with no collateral at all.

These businesses are crystal installing, pig fattening, and farming. She lives in Prk. Mabinuligon, Brgy. Maricalum, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of the NWTF - Project Dungganon since 2007, and she has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans and hard work. As a result, she is helping her family to become more economically stable, and she now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000. \r\n\r\nJocelyn is borrowing PHP 18,000 so that she can continue to purchase raw materials. This will be her 7th loan from NWTF - Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 was repaid well within its term, and was a step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jocelyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Out.\u201d  They offer cold beer and snacks, as well as a friendly atmosphere where anybody can get to know everybody.  Open Tuesday through Sunday from 11 in the morning to 12 at night, it is closed Monday so that Jose and Sylvia can spend time with Jose\u2019s elderly mother.   As Sylvia says, \u201cOur customers are our friends and family.\u201d  Their loyal clientele includes locals as well as \u201cWinter Texans\u201d who come from as far away as Canada to spend winters in the small town of Donna in the Rio Grande Valley.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Joe acquired the bar from an elderly man wanting to retire.  In order to work the bar, Joe took a temporary leave of absence from H-E-B, a Texas grocery store where he had worked for eighteen years.  At the end of three months, Joe realized that he loved owning the bar and resigned from H-E-B.\r\nJoe and Sylvia live in a house across the street from the bar.  They work hard to make \u201cJoe\u2019s Hide Out\u201d a fun place to be. \r\n\r\nEvery day, Joe and his wife serve free \"botana\" (snacks) like squash and chicken, beef and potatoes, and hot dogs.  Recognizing their generosity, customers sometimes pitch in to help cover the cost.  Even when that doesn\u2019t happen, Joe and Sylvia believe it is worth it, because it is fun and attracts business.\r\n\r\nAnother tradition at \u201cJoe\u2019s Hide Out\u201d is the rule is that whoever rings the bell must buy a round for everyone in the bar.  Sometimes Joe rings the bell, which gets the customers excited and typically leads to their buying rounds for each other.  On the weekends, Jose, Sylvia, and their friends and customers barbecue on their outside grill.  They have musicians come and play music while customers eat, drink, and dance on the patio.\r\n\r\nThis is Joe and Sylvia\u2019s second loan with ACCION Texas-Louisiana.  With their first loan, they expanded the bar, added pool tables, and bought a television.  With this loan, they will fix the bar\u2019s air conditioner and repair their parking lot.

He lives with his wives and their children in his own house in Medine, one of the popular districts in the town of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nAfter unsuccessfully trying his hand at several businesses, including agriculture, he rapidly learned the business of stocking and retailing food products such as tiger nuts, Shea nuts, and cereals, in which he started ten years ago. With such an experience in this domain, he enjoys a strong reputation and gets many orders from the outside, but he is lacking the resources to meet the demand. He therefore joined Soro Yiriwaso four years ago, and has benefited from four loans, which were all timely repaid.\r\nIn order to better meet his ever-growing customer demand, he is requesting this fifth loan. It will enable him to purchase 15 bags of tiger nuts, three tons of corn, seven bags of millet and eight bags of Shea nuts. He gets his supplies from the towns around Sikasso and then stocks them in his store located in the new Medine market of Sikasso, before transferring them to Abidjan and Bobo Dioulasso (respectively in the Republics of Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso) when he gets orders from manufacturers of tiger nut juice and Shea butter. As for cereals, they are sold locally, both wholesale and retail, but mostly to retailers.\r\nWith this loan, he is planning on a monthly benefit of 300,000 FCFA. With the profit, he means to address his main expenditure, his family's expenses, to pay his loan's interests and to reinvest the remainder in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":863414,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase food products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-09-04T22:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Issa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":250986.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655505},{"amount":550,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:19Z","rounded_local_amount":250986.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424628}],"funded_date":"2011-09-16T17:49:02Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Buecheler","image":566239}},{"id":337113,"name":"G\u00fclcan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"G\u00fclcan is 30 years old and married.
