She has her own business selling personal hygiene and home products like powders, deodorants, tooth paste, disinfectants, toilet paper, over-the-counter drugs, and groceries.  She takes cash and credit.  \r\n\r\nThe business grew out of her husband's job. He promoted similar products for a company, and when he stopped working there, he used his severance pay to start his own independent business, since he already knew the field.  He taught Sandra, too, so she could help out and they could make money together.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Sandra's first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She'll buy soaps, deodorants, powders, ant tooth paste.

This micro-grid is expected to meet the needs of up to 500 households.\u00a0Kiva loans allow EarthSpark to increase the number of beneficiaries by reducing the up-front costs for customers, and will be repaid over time by electricity sales.\n\nTo see a video of Les Anglais and the hybrid solar grid, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iq2m3rRDePk\">click here<\/a>."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1695595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to connect to Haiti's first solar hybrid smart electricity grid.

She lives in a nuclear family with her husband and their children in the Nangosso district of Koutiala prefecture (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nBorn into a family of tradesmen, Madame Traor\u00e9 was initiated into revenue-generating activities at a very young age (her parents never wanted her to attend school). After a long apprenticeship at her grandmother\u2019s side, she decided to specialize in trading cereals ten years ago now. There is a very heavy demand from her clientele because rice constitutes one of Mali\u2019s basic foods. \r\n\r\nAnxious to better satisfy her clientele, in 2004 she decided to turn to the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso (Kiva Field Partner). With an experience of six solidarity loans (group loans) fully repaid, she is on her second individual loan; the first having been completed with no problem.\r\n\r\nWith this loan Madame Traor\u00e9 intends to buy a ton of rice at Niono (one of the largest rice-growing areas in the Republic of Mali) from the growers in the rice fields.She retails the rice for cash or credit at the big market in Koutiala to a clientele consisting of both men and women. This is a very lucrative operation, with a large profit margin, such that she expects to make a profit of 70,000 FCFA ($150) per cycle. This profit will be used to repay the loan interest and contribute to the family expenses.

He is a farmer who owns a small piece of land on which he grows rice. His wife, Mrs. Pao Nim, is a pig breeder. Even though they try to work hard, they earn less income than they need to support their household. \r\n\r\nThey want to start a new business using rice to make the wine to sell. Thus, Mr. Phen S. has decided to ask for a loan to buy more rice and wine making supplies to make the wine.

She is 42 years old. Melenia is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Melenia owns & operates a nipa (palm) weaving business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from weaving & selling nipa (palm) products to local businesses and community members. Melenia has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 6800 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Melenia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Melenia is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offerings. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Melenia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She didn\u2019t have a formal education and it was her husband who taught her how to sew and manufacture clothing.  It was a bit of a challenge at first, because she also had to care for her one year old son.\r\n\r\nShe has always wanted to work on her own and it was a friend who encouraged her to lease a workshop in a central location.  This allowed her to earn additional income and improve her quality of life.  Her husband bought her first sewing machine (basic), which she still keeps as a memento.\r\n\r\nNelly began making dresses and skirts.  Her neighbors knew that she was a seamstress and it was they who recommended her services to their friends.  She began to increase her income little by little, completed her studies, and over time began buying more fabrics and thread with the loans she received.\r\n\r\nShe had the opportunity to become well known in the various schools, where she maD. uniforms for teachers, but it became necessary for her to acquire a chain stitch sewing machine.  For this reason she approached Edaprospo-Prosperidad to request a loan in order to buy the machine.  Things went well for her and she began making wedding gowns and formals.  This generated additional income for her.\r\n\r\nShe did a good job managing her business and was able to buy more machines and the income provided her the means with which to pay for her three children\u2019s education.  They have all achieved professional careers.  She was also able to buy her own workshop in a central location and no longer offers her services to private institutions because her business is doing very well.  The income she now earns is for herself and for her husband, and to treat her grandchildren.\r\n\r\nNelly will use the money from this loan to buy fabric because she has orders for dresses for the Peruvian Independence Day.  It makes her feel good to have achieved most of her goals and to continue to be able to support her family by running the business she enjoys; dressmaking.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":583059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-08-13T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":293.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":825,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":825.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831598},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":825,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":825.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098157},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":825,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":825.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390826},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":825,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:04Z","rounded_local_amount":825.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529106}],"funded_date":"2010-08-15T19:45:48Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She lives in her own house with her 3 young children who help her in her agricultural work. Ever since she found herself raising 3 children alone, she decided to dedicate herself to her work even more. She continued planting potatoes and olluco in her own fields. When her children were young, they began to help her in this very laborious work.  Since then, the four of them work every day to get ahead. They watch over their crops very carefully, especially guarding against the insect pests that often ruin entire crops.  During harvest, she takes all of the prudiction and transports it to the wholesalers in town, who offer regular prices for the quality of her natural products. Since she is a very enterprising woman, in the future she plans to buy some heads of cattle in order to raise them and sell their milk. She also wants to finish building her house. This is the eleventh loan that she has with MFP and she promises to make all the payments on time because she is very grateful to the people who made this loan possible which will allow her to continue working and looking to progress. She is also very satisfied with the work in her community group because it is made up of people who are very supportive and responsible. She plans on investing the loan she has asked for in buying organic and chemical fertilizers. A portion of it will also be used to pay for the work of the laborers whom she has hired to help in the planting. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":590473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and pay for the laborers who help in the planting.

They have five children who are 3 to 15 years old. Gina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so she can continue to save for her business and her children's education. Gina A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  Qu\u00fd is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by SEDA.

The official name of this borrowing group is An T\u1eadp 01 (Nh\u00f3m 01).\r\n\r\n\r\nQu\u00fd is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, Qu\u00fd owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling herbs & spices in the local community.  Qu\u00fd has been engaged in this business for over 8 years and earns approximately 3,500,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Qu\u00fd joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Qu\u00fd has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,048,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  She is now requesting a new loan of 7,392,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Qu\u00fd  from SEDA.  Qu\u00fd plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb T.

Her family lives in a brick house, in the outer ger housing districts of the city. Odgerel\u2019s mother is retired and stays at home, while her daughter attends secondary school. Odgerel supports her family by operating a clothing retail stall at Narantuul, the largest outdoor market in Mongolia. \r\n\r\nIn 2006, when she first began her business, she sold only leather belts and traditional Mongolian fabric belts. In the beginning stages of her business, she rented a stall at Narantuul from another person who had a rental contract with Narantuul. This was an unstable business situation for her because the middleman could dismiss her at any time. At the time her stall had 1 million MNT in working capital. Usually, it is very difficult to obtain a rental contract with Narantuul because the stalls are in such high demand.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 2009, Odgerel had the opportunity to sign a rental contract directly with Narantuul in order to make her business more stable. Now her working capital is almost 4 million MNT, and she sells many clothing accessories like socks, gloves, hats, and belts. With this loan, Odgerel will purchase small clothing accessories from Ereen City, China. She is hoping to sell the clothing accessories to rural and urban customers who visit Narantuul before the traditional Mongolian Lunar New Year.

She is 50 years old. Harselina is the group leader of a 9-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nHarselina is married and has two adult-aged children. To make a living, Harselina owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Harselina has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Harselina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Harselina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Harselina is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Harselina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000.  Rosalie is borrowing PHP 23,000 so that she can continue to fund her business operations. This will be her 26th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 25,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rosalie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married with four children aged between 4 and 13 years, all of them go to school. She is a farmer and she has been farming for the past 6 years. With the loan from kiva, she would like to pay the workers who harvested beans. The profits from the business will be used to buy a goat for rearing and pay school fees for her children.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! This is Cesilia M..  She is 43 years old, married, and has three children (a 12-year-old, an 18-year-old, and a 28-year-old). In addition, she has one dependent who lives with her because her parents live in a remote area. In 2000, Cesilia established her general store business. Working seven days a week, and 13 to 16 hours a day, she earns about $50 each month from this business. She is assisted by her husband. Cesilia has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now seeks a new loan in order to purchase additional stocks of rice, oil, flour, and sugar in bulk. In the future, Cesilia plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. <P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":140639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of rice, oil, sugar, and beans in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-17T12:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-01T12:41:57Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-05-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:06Z","rounded_local_amount":70830,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":198111},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":70830,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":225098},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-07-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":70830,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":254316},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-08-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":70830,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283157},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-09-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-16T07:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":70830,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":313251},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-11T07:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":70830,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344445},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":70830,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347568},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":70830,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970188},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":70830,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886438},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":70830,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435726}],"funded_date":"2008-03-18T12:41:57Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":45282,"name":"Juan Manuel","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Juan Manuel V. started his business three years ago when he was left without work and needed income to support his wife and two children who were in primary school, Jonathan, 10 years old, and Sarri\u00e1, 8.

It is important to point out that each sister works independently and has her own income.  The members of the group have their own business that specialize in such things as the sale of foods, cosmetics and fruit, in the repair of computers, and in the preparation of snack foods and meals.  The members are aware that their businesses face competition but they also know how to work hard and get ahead, thanks to their experience and their good character.   This loan will be used to buy diverse types of products, to expand their businesses selling food and also to buy materials and ingredients.  The members will then be able to increase their income and provide their families with a better quality of life.   The members of this group have received two previous loans and they have been able to prove that they are punctual with making their payments.

She has participated in the TYM Fund for the past ten years.  Currently, she raises pigs, and her husband is a fish farmer.  When she is not taking care of her animals, Mrs. H\u1ea3i takes advantage of any spare time to earn some extra money working part time.  With a total monthly income of 5,000,000 VND (288 USD), the financial situation of her family is improving and becoming more secure.  In the next round of lending, she hopes to borrow 10,000,000 VND (575 USD), to buy a cow and some breeding fish.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

She is a pig breeder. Her husband, Mr. Siem Moeun, is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate rice. Although this couple works hard, they still earn little income to support their family. Thus, Mrs. Ny H. decided to ask for a loan to buy more piglets, pig food, and fertilizers, and she would use the rest of money to buy some food to make soup to sell.

The official name of this borrowing group is 02.06.10 Thieu Hoa (02.06.10 Thieu Hoa).\r\n\r\nSon is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Son raises livestock.

She is married to Reymond G. and is the mother of three young, hardworking adults. By the grace of God, she has managed to support her children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nArlyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.\r\n\r\nArlyn earns by buying supplies at the wholesale price and selling in small quantities. Her store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Arlyn is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nArlyn dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work in her business. She faithfully meets up every week with her fellowship* co-members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":607847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-09-27T12:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arlyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2912.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172089102},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2912.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380467},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2912.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816801},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2184.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652746}],"funded_date":"2010-09-27T12:19:35Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":238704,"name":"Alfredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or  Alfredo R., tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad, es viudo con 2 hijos, todos mayores de edad.\nSe dedica a esta actividad hace m\u00e1s de 25 a\u00f1os, empez\u00f3 trabajando con su t\u00edo, el cual se dedicaba a \u00e9ste rubro hace ya m\u00e1s de 30 a\u00f1os. \nLuego su t\u00edo falleci\u00f3 y se quedo sin trabajo, se le vino en  mente la idea de abrir una carpinter\u00eda propia, para comenzar con su carpinter\u00eda, tuvo que vender un terreno, que recibi\u00f3 como herencia de su madre. \n    Nos cuenta tambi\u00e9n que su se\u00f1ora en vida lo ayudaba mucho para que puedan seguir adelante y as\u00ed poder darles la posibilidad de estudiar a sus hijos  para tener una mejor calidad de vida. \nEl pr\u00e9stamo solicitado es para la compra de maderas para fabricar  muebles ya que tiene muchos pedidos de los mismos. \nAgradece mucho a la Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya el cr\u00e9dito otorgado.\n","en":"Alfredo R. is 43 years old and a widower with 2 children who older in age.\r\nHe has been in this field (furniture making) for more than 25 years.

Josefina has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Josefina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josefina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Josefina is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Josefina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Gertruda R., 34, dreams for the best, but more than that, she acts to make it a reality. Ruby, as she is called by friends, reached college and is married to Joseph Ryan, a general manager. They have a child who is in elementary school. Together they live in Pasay City.\r\n\r\nWith the learning she gains as a Community Partner in CCT*, Ruby runs her own sari-sari (variety) store to capitalize on the big target market she has in her community. She has been doing business here for two years. It is quite easy for her since it is a residential business, and there is not much need at present to hire employees. She earns Php800 a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she would like to request for a Php15,000 loan. This she plans to buy more grocery items to put in her store, so that it would not have to look bare and incomplete. Ruby takes effort to maintain her business in good shape, because a profitable business translates to family needs being met and the schooling of her child being supported. \r\n\r\nRuby struggles with time management when it comes to balancing business, health and family life. One proof of this is her health problem. However, she sees to it that these struggles will not prevent her from reaching her dreams for her family. She desires to see her small store grow and eventually expand. She dreams of good health for everyone in the family, having their own house and lot, and permanent job for her husband, and a big happy family. Deep inside, she knows that if there is faith, and action, it will be possible.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":698442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

They live in a house that they own in Sector Teresa, a rural community in the Pichari district.  Saturnina has never forgotten the afternoons she spent as a teenager watching her grandparents prepare their fields for cacao.  She's a cacao farmer herself now, practicing everything that she learned from her grandparents then.  Using new technologies, for example, for sowing crops.  At harvest time, though, she hires farm laborers to help her.  There's a lot of demand for cacao now, both in Peru and abroad, and Saturnina is happy with the money her crops can make.  She sells what she harvests at the local Centros de Acopio [warehouse].  For the future, she wants to buy more land so that she can compete on an equal footing with neighboring farmers.  This is Saturnina's first MFP loan.  She is counting on your support to help her meet her goals.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Ni Luh Roteh already obtained some profit from the pig farming business. Despite the humble barn made of bamboo, Ni Luh Roteh is still very keen to develop the business. Using the second loan from Dinari, Ni Luh Roteh bought one female pig which cost Rp. 800,000. Since she started breeding it, it has produced 12 piglets. In three months, she could sell 12 pigs for Rp. 3,000,000.  Her profit is Rp.2,000,000 after deducting the revenue with the pig food expense for 6 months. She hopes she can add one more female pig in the future so that she can gain more revenue.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nPada pinjaman pertama  Ni Luh Roteh mempergunakan untuk membeli pakan karena sebelumnya ia sudah memiliki 1 ekor induk dan 1 ekor penggemukan.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Today Khosiyat is requesting 1275 US Dollars in order to expand her inventory. Khosiyat would like to thank everyone supporting her and to ensure them that she\u2019ll pay back the loan in 12 months.<P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Bone Village, Nekamese Sub District \u2013 Kupang District. Bone village has a beautiful view and there are many coconut, banana, and palm trees. This village has not been contaminated by air pollution, so the community can breathe fresh air. Most of community members of this village are originally from Timor and they usually speak Timorese in everyday conversation.<p>\r\n\r\nThe villagers have backgrounds as breeders and farmers, raising cows, goats and pigs and cultivating rice fields, the latter fraught with the challenges posed by inconsistent water supplies and diseases.  These challenges are also faced by Adolof and the other members of Kuanputun B1 Group.<p>\r\n   \r\nAdolof is married and has four children. The children are:\r\n-\tDoni N., a 22-year-old high school graduate now attending the selection process to be in the army.\r\n-\tJackson N.,  a 20-year-old high school still looking for a job and now spending his days helping his parents on the farm.\r\n-\tMelkior N., 16 years old in the third grade of Junior High School\r\n-\tAlwi N., 9 years old in the fourth grade of Elementary School.<p>\r\n\r\nAdolof and his wife are poor farmers but they are really responsible to their children. Even though they only generate a small income from their business, they always support and encourage their children to complete their schooling. For Adolof, education is important for their future.<p>\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty that Adolof faces as a farmer is the availability of public transportation, which only operates three times a week, and the location of the market, which is situated about 37 km from Bone village, so their agricultural products cannot be sold faster. \r\n\r\nAs a father of four children, Adolof wants to improve the living standard of his family, and the cattle-fattening program seems to offer the best prospect for achieving his goal. He is therefore requesting a loan of IDR 3,400,000 to buy young cattle to be fattened over a 12-month period. The other group members of Kuanputun B1 are also requesting the same loan, also hoping to improve their lives \r\n\r\nNote: Martinus was replaced by a family member when the group picture was taken.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":354626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle to be fattened.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bone","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-07-18T00:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":156,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adolof","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yohana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jakson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Debora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nahor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yuliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Afliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lodia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nikolas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":50700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":4329.39,"local_amount":43900000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-22T09:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":44065248.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124001206},{"amount":335.31,"local_amount":3400000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:24:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3412798.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136755434},{"amount":335.3,"local_amount":3400000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-22T12:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3412798.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182619969}],"funded_date":"2009-07-22T00:56:05Z","paid_date":"2010-12-22T12:14:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":127238,"name":"Mercedes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cA person without a goal doesn\u2019t know his destination.\u201d This is the guiding principle of Mercedes C. who is currently residing in Inaban, Dupax del Norte, Nueva Vizcaya.

She is a mother to six; four sons and two daughters.\n She and her husband are partners in their fishing business. She has been doing it for twenty three years already and her major source of livelihood. This is her primary business. Aside from fishing, she is also doing the vegetable and dried fish vending as her secondary business. She wanted to invest more on her businesses.\nShe became of ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.) member, an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2009. When she received her first loan, she was given hope to improve her business. And now on her second loan, she proposes a loan of 10,000 PHP as additional capital for her fishing business and part will go to her secondary business. The loan will be used to pay for 1 bundle fishnet, fingerlings, and part of the amount will go to her secondary business.\nShe is hopeful that with the help of ASHI and trust of KIVA lenders, she can improve her business and can slowly reach her aspiration to get out from poverty. She also dreams of sending all of her children to school until they finish college and find jobs.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":394245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

L. farms beans and corn; he also raises cattle.  He will use this funding to buy land suitable for planting beans and corn.  He has part of the money already and the financing will make up the difference.  Yader S. L. started farming with the support of his parents, who willed him a small, 1\/2-manzana (about 0.8 acre), plot of land where he built his house and where he has lived with his wife ever since.  He began with his own efforts and financial help from Ceprodel to grow beans and corn only during the Winter.  He has always been in this line of work since he got experience in it helping his parents.  He is married and has one minor daughter; his wife helps him with his work.  He has cooperated with Ceprodel for about 4 years and the impact this has had has been very good because the loans have allowed him to buy 3 manzanas of land.  This has allowed for larger cultivation area of this basic grain that is such an integral part of our economy.

The members of this group of 7 women are engaged in many varied productive activities including: food sales, a corner store, chicken rearing, bread making, and sewing. They have formed a strong bond with one another. It is apparent that these women regard community, solidarity, and hard work as values central to their beliefs. <P>\r\n\r\nTheir special bond has developed because the members of the group have been neighbours all their lives, and thus know each other on a very deep and personal level. The positive experience that this group has had throughout the duration of their first loan has inspired new members to join the group. This will be the group's second loan with Fundacion Mujer; the first loan was paid back on time and in full. The loan officer who has been working with this group commends the members on their strong history of punctual repayments.<P>\r\n\r\nSocorro P. V. is experienced in sales. Every day, she makes \u201cpan\u201d a type of bread that she sells fresh to her neighbours and others in her community. Socorro also sews women's clothes (underwear and blouses) which she sells on the weekends in Guapiles. She travels by bus with her clothing products, taking a combination of 3 buses. Guapiles, in the Carribean region of Costa Rica, is roughly 2 hours away. Socorro has lived in Poas her entire life. At the age of 54 she is one of the eldest in the group, and she takes pride in the level of trust that has always existed in her community. \u201cThere is no trouble,\u201d she says, \u201cif anyone makes trouble it\u2019s because they come from outside of our community.\u201d Her enthusiasm for life is inspiring; she says that every day is a gift.<P>\r\n\r\nAngela R. L. is the elected president of the group. She is 57 years old and has 8 children. Angela has a business sewing and selling clothes such as pants for men and women, children\u2019s clothing, shirts, and pyjamas. She also sews quilts and other types of bedding.<P>\r\n\r\nYorleny M. P. raises chickens and then sells the eggs they lay. She is 34 years old and lives with her four children. With her first loan, she made the mistake of buying the wrong feed for her chicks, so they ended up too fat to lay eggs. As a result, she has sold these chickens and plans to use this second loan to purchase the correct feed so that she might have some chickens that lay eggs. Yorleny has thankfully maintained a good sense of humour regarding her mistake.<P>\r\n\r\nVera Maria S. Z. is 43 years old and has 3 children. She has a business preparing and selling foods to people in her community. She works out of her home Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Vera makes the majority of her sales in the afternoons and at night. She sells hamburgers, tacos, and 'ceviche' among other products. She says her tacos are the most popular item on the menu. <P>\r\n\r\nLaura Espinoza R. is 32 years old. She has one child and her highest level of formal education is the completion of primary school. Laura runs a beauty salon where she employs one other person. She will use this loan to buy hair and beauty products in order to better serve her clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":479734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

They've had the bookstore for almost 10 years and the internet access booths for 8 years, and both sides of the business do well. Elvira's husband enjoys working in sales and he is very creative. For this reason he also works as a graphic designer for various stores, using his earnings to expand his and Elvira's business.  Elvira supports her husband in all these efforts, with the hope of having their own home soon. \r\n\r\nThis is Elvira's fifth loan with MFP [the Kiva field partner], and she promises to be responsible with her repayments. She also mentions that she has found it satisfying to work with the other members of her Communal Bank. With the money from the current loan she will buy a glass shop window and replacement parts for computers, in order to increase the income from their business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":497710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of replacement parts for computers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-27T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":429},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":429},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":429},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":429},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":429},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":429},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":426}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.57},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.57},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.57},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":146.58,"local_amount":429,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":434.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993333},{"amount":146.57,"local_amount":429,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":434.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718117},{"amount":146.58,"local_amount":429,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":434.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751791},{"amount":146.57,"local_amount":429,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:19Z","rounded_local_amount":434.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934253},{"amount":146.58,"local_amount":429,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":434.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673026},{"amount":146.57,"local_amount":429,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":434.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886837},{"amount":145.55,"local_amount":426,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":431.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153850}],"funded_date":"2010-02-28T18:26:05Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

He is single and lives in his own house with his parents, Luis, 54, and Rosa, 45, and 2 of his 8 siblings. This family is very close; despite the fact that the children are older and independent, they help with the family finances.  When his parents gave over some land to him as part of his inheritance, he didn't hesitate and began to grow coffee and plantains. He has been doing this activity for more than a year. At times, his parents and his siblings help him, but when it's time to clear and harvest he hires laborers. Thanks to the care and techniques his father taught him, he was abe to have a harvest on the first try. Nonetheless, it has been difficult to transport the sacks of product from his filed to town. His work is very profitable, because it allows him to continue investing in his land, cover his necessities, help his family and save for new challenges in the future, like having more coffee plantings, because it is in demand. He also wants to study accounting in the city. This is his second loan with  MFP, and once again he is committed to not letting the other members of the group down, because he is happy with his community bank. With the loan he is asking for, he will buy 20 sacks of fertilizer which will protect his plantings. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":550435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy 20 sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-10T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dany ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1423,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588199}],"funded_date":"2010-06-10T13:59:35Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":210036,"name":"Bashiran's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bashiran is a citizen of the city called Riwind, Pakistan which is about 30km far away from the city of Lahore.

Rosa has a grocery store where she sells basic consumer products such as pasta, bread, eggs and other items that are essential in the home.  She has had this business for 5 years, and it has allowed her to improve her family's economic situation, which for a time was pretty bad because she did not have the products that people were looking for and this greatly decreased her earnings.  For this reason, Rosa requests a loan from INTEGRAL, so that she can have the money to stock her store with the products that she needs but does not have, and to increase the quantity of the products that she already has.  Rosa wants to improve her business so that she can proviD. her children with everything that they need.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":618288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He has lived with his wife Constantina for 30 years.  The couple have five children but only two still live with them.  They live in their own home which is located in La Esperanza neighborhood.\r\n\r\nFrancisco's aged face reflects his agricultural wisdom and experience.  He has been growing peas, corn, potatoes and beans for 35 years.  He grows these crops on his own farmland.  He tells us that the profits used to be greater years ago and so he was able to support his children and get them ahead in life.  Although it is now harder for him, he does not become discouraged as he has the knowledge he needs to produce a top-quality harvest.  In addition, he has regular customers in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma where he takes his crops to sell.\r\n\r\nAs Francisco is a country man, he owns cows, pigs and sheep which provide him with extra money as he fattens them and sells them at a good price.  Right now, this hard-working man is concentrating on his upcoming pea harvest which he hopes will make him good profits.  \r\n\r\nFrancisco is a member of the \"Punray Avanzando\" community bank.

Palm nuts are very important for the population because they can be used to product palm oil, which is essential for cooking.

From a young age she has been interested in income-generating activities, particularly selling grains and \"ati\u00e8k\u00e8\" (cassava- or wild yam-based semolina that restaurant owners season and sell with fish) which she has been doing for over ten years now. Following three years of partnership with Soro Yiriwaso, she received three solidarity loans (group loans) and is on her second individual loan. All of these previous loans have been properly repaid. With this loan, she intends to buy 15 bags of beans and 40 bags of ati\u00e8k\u00e8. Madame Djeneba C. gets her supply of beans from small farmers involved in this trade at weekly markets in the villages near S\u00e9gou. The ati\u00e8k\u00e8 she gets from Ivoirian wholesalers who stock traders in the main city market of Sikasso. Her customer base is made up mostly of home restaurant owners and resalers; Madame Djeneba C. sometimes sells on weekly credit, for cash, at homes and in the market on market days. Madame Djeneba C. envisions making a weekly profit of 40,000 Francs CFA that will be used to pay the interest on her loan, to contribute to her family's expenses, and the rest to invest in her business.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Desde muy ni\u00f1a se ha dedicado a la crianza de animales como vacunos y ovinos, asimismo aprendi\u00f3 a elaborar queso, actividad heredada de su madre. Cada viernes a las 6.00am sale a comprar leche, ya que sus vacas no abastecen para la cantidad de pedidos que tiene y los quesos que elabora son a base de leche de corderito, y son muy solicitados ya que tienen un sabor muy natural e inconfundible. Una vez con los ingredientes b\u00e1sicos procede a colocarlos en lo horma de ichu que nos muestra en la foto, para que siga su proceso de prensado, luego los guarda en cubetas para que escurra el suero, y cada domingo los comercializa en el mercado de su localidad. Gracias a este negocio pudo educar a sus hijos, sin contar con el apoyo del padre. Victoria es una cliente muy responsable, las veces que tiene que llevar los quesos no puede asistir a las reuniones, pero deja su cuota encargada con sus vecinas o familiares para que paguen la cantidad fijada. Este es su 4to cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y durante este tiempo no ha ca\u00eddo en  morosidad. El dinero que solicita es para la compra de avena en chacras sembradas y plantas de ma\u00edz, esto le sirve para el alimento de sus vacas. ","en":"Victoria is 48 years old and has 8 children, 3 of which no longer live at home. From the time she was a little girl, she has raised animals like cows and sheep, and her mother also taught her to make cheese. Every Friday at 6 a.m. she goes to buy milk, since her cows don't produce enough for the number of orders she receives. She makes her cheeses from cow's milk, and they have a very natural and unmistakable flavor. Once she has the basic ingredients, she places them in a mold made of ichu (a grass native to the Andean altiplano), which she's displaying in the photo, so the cheese can be pressed. Then she puts them on trays so the whey can drain off. She sells them every Sunday in her town's market. Thanks to this business, she's been able to educate her children without any support from their father. Victoria is a very responsible client. When she has to transport the cheeses she can't attend meetings, but she leaves her payments with her neighbors or family members so they can pay them for her. This is her fourth loan with MFP, and she hasn't fallen into despair.

La tierra nutrida y preparada que tiene, le brinda a Celestino una deliciosa papa que luego de la cosecha es vendida y as\u00ed puede obtener ganancias y con ello logra sacar adelante a su familia. \nA \u00e9l le gusta la agricultura porque la aprendi\u00f3 de sus padres, no le dieron una profesi\u00f3n pero le dieron las herramientas necesarias para trabajar y le ense\u00f1aron como producir la tierra; adem\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la crianza de ganado ovino que comercializa en los mercados de su localidad. \nEn el futuro no solo le gustar\u00eda sembrar papa, sino tambi\u00e9n hortalizas, porque sabe que debe aprovechar la tierra al m\u00e1ximo y pensar siempre en el futuro, para darles a sus hijos una buena educaci\u00f3n y ense\u00f1arles t\u00e9cnicas nuevas que les permitan sobrevivir en este mundo que crece cada d\u00eda de una manera vertiginosa.\n\nEste es el tercer pr\u00e9stamo que tiene Celestino con MFP y lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de abono, insecticidas y fertilizantes para su tierra, porque sabe que adem\u00e1s de aprovecharla debe cuidarla para seguir produciendo. Celestino pertenece a un banco comunal establecido que es muy responsable con cada uno de los pagos porque saben que solo as\u00ed todos tendr\u00e1n la oportunidad de progresar.","en":"Celestino is 53 years old, and still maintains the vitality of a youngster.  He lives with his wife (Juliana) who is 49 years old, and his two children; Katia is 19 years old, and Alexander is 8.  They are what give him the motivation to forge ahead.\r\n\r\nThis man wakes each and every day anxious to work the land that witnessed his birth, which sustained his ancestors and today continues to yield prosperous crops so that hard-working men like him can care for their families.  The nutrient-rich and prepared land provides Celestino with a delicious potato crop that he harvests and then sells to help support his family.  He enjoys farming, a vocation he learned from his parents.  They didn\u2019t provide him with a career, but gave him the necessary skills and taught him how to work the land.  In addition, he raises sheep to sell in nearby markets.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to plant not only potatoes but also vegetables.  He knows he must take advantage of the land to its fullest and always think about the future, to provide his children with good educations and the skills necessary to survive in this world that grows at a dizzying pace.\r\n\r\nThis is Celestino\u2019s third loan with MFP, and he plans to invest the funds into fertilizers and insecticides for his lands.  He knows that, in addition to enjoying the fruits of his labor, he must care for the land so it will continue to produce.  Celestino belongs to an established cooperative bank that is very responsible for all its repayments, because they know this is the only way that they will have the opportunity to advance.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":433594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase insecticides and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T14:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celestino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":504,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751223}],"funded_date":"2009-11-24T14:18:02Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":160262,"name":"Nenita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nenita S. is a hardworking grandmother, mother, and wife.

She is forty-six years old. Cholpon and her husband have three wonderful children. Their only aim now is to give their children a proper education and help them get on their feet and bring their own dreams into reality. While their children are growing up, Cholpon and her husband are doing their best to provide them with all necessary things, whether it is food, clothes or school supplies, so that their children do not feel the need for anything. The elder daughters are college students and the younger daughter goes to school.\r\n\r\nCholpon\u2019s husband is a school teacher, and he and Cholpon keep some cattle and trade them on weekends. Cholpon has applied for this loan because she hopes to buy a calf for feeding and resale.

She is a hardworking woman who shares her life with her husband \u00c1ngel, who is 25, and their two year old daughter Luz Clarita.  For more than two years, they have leased farmland on which they grow coffee and bananas.  Judith and her husband have worked to generate more income to help cover the household expenses.  At the same time, her husband works the fields of other farmers.  He earns 20 PEN each day, but during the harvest season there is twice as much work, so Judith is also hired for this job.   What she enjoys most is living in the country since the plants and the sounds of the animals convey a peace that makes her happy.  On the flip side, she dislikes transporting her crops to the city over great distances since the sacks are heavy.  However, she says the effort is worth it.  Judith indicates the services she utilized have been quite substantial now that she has the chance to save toward the purchase of her own land in hopes of increasing production.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is assisted by her children. Mariamu has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now seeks a new loan in order to purchase a machine to process traditional herbs. In the future, Mariamu plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. <P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":140704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a machine to process traditional herbs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-18T23:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariamu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-02T04:25:39Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-05-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":199171},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-06-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226062},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-07-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":255397},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-08-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":284140},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-09-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-18T07:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":314317},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-10-02T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":345748},{"amount":39.5,"local_amount":46470.56,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:21:10Z","rounded_local_amount":46629.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347577},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":50171.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970197},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":50171.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886447},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50171.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435733}],"funded_date":"2008-03-19T04:25:39Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T20:59:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":45330,"name":"Blanca Luz","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p>Blanca belongs to the community bank Mujeres Creativas 2, located at Asentamiento Human Rumbo al Futuro Mz 3 Lt.7, in the district of Manantay in the city of Ucayali.

She lives on Huandoy Alley in Huaraz Province and District in the Department of Ancash. She is a 38 year old separated mother of three children, all of whom are dependents. With her first loan of 300 soles, Amparo bought more merchandise in the form of socks. She has been working with her village bank for the past two years. \r\n\r\nAmparo is still in the same line of work, and varies the products she sells according to the season. She is currently gearing up for regional holidays in the Callej\u00f3n de Huaylas and Callej\u00f3n de los Conchudos Valleys. \r\n\r\nAmparo will use 80% of her 1700 soles loan to buy more socks and spices. She is currently in delicate health, and will use the other 20% of her loan to pay for a low-risk hernia operation. \r\n\r\nMost of her fellow group members and friends consider Amparo to be a very hard-working, enterprising woman.

Sometimes in order to reach your goal you have to put up with temporary obstacles and get used to rough conditions. However, provided that there is determination to keep going and readiness to sacrifice personal comfort, the result does not let the person down. The question is whether he or she is ready to go beyond the usual conditions and take a risk. Once they make this decision, go through this path and achieve success, their stories become models for others to follow. \r\n\r\n<p>Elmira is the leader of this group. She is 43 years old. Elmira and her family live in the city of Tokmok. Her husband manufactures metal instruments and has a monthly salary of $50. Elmira\u2019s daughter rents space in a big shop and sells bijouterie (jewelry). She manages to make $80. Elmira\u2019s son is 14 and studies in the seventh grade. Some years ago Elmira started with selling children\u2019s clothes and later on switched to trading in men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothes. This business provides her with a monthly income of $350.  Elmira hopes to obtain this loan and invest the funds to increase the turnover by buying more kinds of clothes for the upcoming spring season. Her future plans are to buy a flat and provide her son with a college education. \r\n\r\nElmira\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nSaikal is 41, divorced and has two daughters. To provide for her daughters and her elderly mother, Saikal sells potatoes in the local market. She brings potatoes from another region. Saikal needs a loan to be able to bring more potatoes. \r\n\r\nKuljan is 38, divorced and has a daughter. Kuljan trades in bed clothing. She also manufactures national articles and manages to earn $160. Kuljan needs a loan as she wants to buy more bed clothing.\r\n\r\nRayimbek is 23, married and has a newborn daughter. Until now he has been trading in cattle with his brother and sharing the income. He decided to take out a loan and start his own business.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in
