Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":119932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To expand her range of clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-02-03T21:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hamisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-18T06:17:39Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38,"local_amount":42222.22,"processed_date":"2008-03-18T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":44194,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160814},{"amount":38,"local_amount":42222.22,"processed_date":"2008-04-18T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":44194,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":185871},{"amount":38,"local_amount":42222.22,"processed_date":"2008-05-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":44194,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":213601},{"amount":38,"local_amount":42222.22,"processed_date":"2008-06-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":44194,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":241813},{"amount":38,"local_amount":42222.22,"processed_date":"2008-07-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":44194,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270798},{"amount":38,"local_amount":42222.22,"processed_date":"2008-08-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":44194,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":300007},{"amount":222,"local_amount":246666.67,"processed_date":"2008-09-11T14:07:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":258186,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323966}],"funded_date":"2008-02-04T06:17:39Z","paid_date":"2008-09-22T07:14:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":37539,"name":"Srey Aun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Srey Aun P. , 21, and her husband have been married for three years and have one son.

AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% to Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":225986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"

She does all the arranging of the wedding cake, the wedding clothes, and the decorations.  In Uganda, it is traditional for special gift baskets to be prepared and given to the bride and groom in a very ceremonial way at the wedding.  These baskets should be covered with decorations that match the decorations at the rest of the wedding.  All of the cars involved in a wedding also have some ribbon tied around that matches the wedding\u2019s colors.  Proscovia is responsible for all of these arrangements.   <P>\r\n\r\nFor the wedding clothes, Proscovia has a dress that she rents out for 100,000 USH.  This allows her to make a large profit because she can either loan her own, which makes her the most money, or she can rent one from a friend for about 40,000 USH. This means that she can earn anywhere between 60,000 \u2013 100,000 USH just on the clothing for the wedding.    Then for decorations she can earn anywhere from 80,000 \u2013 100,000 profit per wedding.  <P>\r\n\r\nProscovia has 2 workers that help her with all of the arrangements needed for this business.    She also has a side business selling women\u2019s tops and bracelets.  She employs two people who sell these items for her in the surrounding markets.    <P>\r\n\r\nProscovia and her husband have 3 kids together that they care for, and she has one, who is the oldest, that is just hers and that she provides everything for.  With the money that she makes, she is now able to send this oldest girl to boarding school.  This is a dream come true for her.    <P>\r\n\r\nProscovia is requesting a loan of 700,000 USH to purchase two veils for weddings she is coordinating this month.  She will also use part of the loan to buy some more women\u2019s tops and bracelets for re-sale.

AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":405703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"By purchasing more fishes to resell to earn more income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"San","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mok","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saron","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ron","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pov","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":975000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":363387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103738917},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":181693.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110626496},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":363387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118023256},{"amount":331.25,"local_amount":1325000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:06:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1375681.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128894722}],"funded_date":"2009-11-04T05:11:59Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:06:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":148270,"name":"Herminia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Herminia A. is now 53 years old and married to her partner in life and in business, Celso A..

Sometimes they\u2019ll buy finished products like a bed made of bamboo. Then they will resell it, but most of the time they make and then sell the product or sometimes they do custom orders.

Abdukholik is 26 years old, living with his wife and two children. He has been breeding cattle for more than 5 years and he is trying to improve the breed in order to increase his prices. He invests time and money in the feed and medicines that the animals require. He enjoys this work, above all getting milk from his cows, which his wife sells in local markets. Abdukholik keeps going thanks to the help and enthusiasm of his children, along with his wife who helps him to care for the animals. Now Abdukholik needs a loan of $1100 USD to purchase more cattle to expand his business. With your help this will be possible.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 33 years old. Laila is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLaila is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Laila owns and operates a business raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale. Laila has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 8,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Laila joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Laila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Laila is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Laila from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisher folk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":533157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It is made up of four women who each have a different business. The group chose this name because they have been friends for many years.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Dolores Gomes L\u00f3pez is 56 years old, a single mother of five children, three of them daughters, and two of them sons. Four of her children are already married and only the youngest still lives with her. Deiser is 21 years old and is a student in a pre-university course. He is the only one who contributes to household expenses.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been selling groceries for the last ten years and all has gone well since the beginning. Together with her family she has made progress in life, and she has enough income to pay for food on a daily basis. She receives assistance from her one son who works in the fields, and she doesn\u2019t feel that she works alone.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda\u2019s motivation for working is to use her time to obtain money to get ahead, along with her family.

Teddy has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and she now seeks another loan in order to purchase additional stocks of soft drinks in bulk. Undoubtedly, Coca Cola\u00ae is one of the most recognized symbols or 'words\" in the world. Even in the most remote villages in Africa, there is usually some kind of \"bar\" selling Coke, Fanta, and Guinness; Teddy notes that Pepsi has made it to most African capitals but not to the less-populated areas, but she is sure that Pepsi is working on expanding into those areas too!). The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing, which explains why selling soft drinks is such a popular venture regardless of whether you\u2019re the CEO of Coca Cola Ltd. in the United States or a micro-entrepreneur in Tanzania!\r\n\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facilities as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":119955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of soft drinks in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-02-02T15:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teddy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-17T16:08:47Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":117,"local_amount":133714.29,"processed_date":"2008-03-17T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":136071,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160126},{"amount":117,"local_amount":133714.29,"processed_date":"2008-04-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":136071,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":185062},{"amount":117,"local_amount":133714.29,"processed_date":"2008-05-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":136071,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212762},{"amount":117,"local_amount":133714.29,"processed_date":"2008-06-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":136071,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":240919},{"amount":117,"local_amount":133714.29,"processed_date":"2008-07-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":136071,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269839},{"amount":115,"local_amount":131428.57,"processed_date":"2008-08-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":133745,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":298982}],"funded_date":"2008-02-03T16:08:47Z","paid_date":"2008-08-17T09:17:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":37555,"name":"Him","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Mrs. Him C. is 40 years old.

Namun begitu, disela sela kesibukan itu,  Ibu dari I Nengah Edi erawan  (9 Th ) ini juga memiliki satu usaha yaitu beternak babi .Bahkan hasil yang di dapat tak beda jauh dengan pendapatan suaminya. Pendapatan yang cukup untuk menambah biaya kebutuhan  hidup sehari-hari. Diawali dengan  2 ekor penggemukan yang di pelihara dalam waktu  6 bulan. Dulu Ni Made Wiarti bisa meraih keuntungan Rp. 700.000.- \/ panen . Namun setelah terjadinya perubahan perekonomian akibat kenaikan BBM semua barang barang pun ikut naik.  Begitu juga halnya dengan bibit babi maupun pakannya. Untuk membeli satu ekor bibit babi sekarang I Made Wiarti harus menyediakan uang Rp. 325.000.- belum lagi biaya pakan yang sangat tinggi. Namun, Ni Made Wiarti tak mau menyerah begitu saja walau dengan modal pinjaman dari Dinari, ia tetap menjalankan usahanya ini bahkan jumlah peliharaanya pun lebih banyak. Tentunya juga dengan harapan hasil panennya lebih banyak sehingga keuntungannya jadi meningkat. Dengan demikian Ni Made Wiarti bisa menabung  untuk persiapan biaya pendidikan anaknya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":194659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase piglets and fodder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-08-31T12:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Made Wiarti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-14T14:32:27Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":583333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":1166666.66,"processed_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-19T20:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1230575.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308552},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":1166666.66,"processed_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-03T09:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1230575.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849775},{"amount":76.19,"local_amount":666666.68,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":703186.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080610},{"amount":57.15,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-19T08:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":527389.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35973827}],"funded_date":"2008-08-31T14:32:27Z","paid_date":"2009-05-19T08:23:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":66239,"name":"Berha Aurora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Bertha, socia del Banco Comunal \u201cMujeres de la Colina II\u201d, vive en la Regi\u00f3n y Provincia de San Mart\u00edn, distrito de Banda de Shilcayo.

The money he requests is to buy insecticides to control the bad parts of his plants. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Hopkins, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":306871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Compra de insecticidas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-22T20:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"El\u00edas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":539.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211483}],"funded_date":"2009-04-22T21:25:26Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Hopkins","image":null}},{"id":107210,"name":"Marina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marina was born in 1987 and comes from the big village of Petrovo.

Justine is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka area of Uganda.  She is married and has one child.  Justine has a business running a small restaurant in Kyotera.  Justine has had her business for approximately three years.\r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Justine is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy more food stocks to use in her restaurant, and also to invest in the restaurant\u2019s upkeep.  Justine hopes to bring more clients to her restaurant, and generate greater profits for her family.  \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":559260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Food

He lives in his own home with his wife Eva and he tries to work as hard as he can to improve their quality of life.  In the Miraflores community (in the district of La Merced) Leoncio runs his business out of his home; he sells chickens, ducks and geese.  He does his best to keep them well-fed and well taken care of so he can sell them more quickly.  He feels content with the money her earns through his business and would like to work harder to do even better in this line of work.  His favorite part of his job is feeding the birds as he feeds them a great amount of love; nonetheless, it takes a lot of time to take care of them.  In the future, he plans to rent a storefront where he can offer better attend to his customers.  This is his 3rd loan through MFP; he knows that he must make his payments punctually and he is willing to do so.  In his village bank, he is a very happy and responsible member.

She sells health products, a business she started out in 2010 with the help of a loan granted to her by a promoter of these products. She completes her sales on credit, with two bi-weekly payments. Her first clients were her friends and family but gradually her clients have increased for the referrals that have been made. Her goal in the future is to have a specialized store featuring these products, operating from her own home. But she faces a great challenge and that is insufficient capital funds to achieve her goal. This is the reason why she requests a Kiva loan. It is the first loan she accesses through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) and it will help her stimulate growth. With this loan she will purchase health products, including biotherapies, and natural and aromatherapy treatments for hair, body, and feet. These products are very well accepted by her clientele, especially having observed benefits from their experience. As Diana works and expends her efforts she strives to achieve her dream of expanding her business.

He is 48 this year and happily married with five children. His children are 27, 21, 19, 15 and 9 years old, respectively. All five of them are currently attending school. Paul lives with his family in Cape Coast, the regional capital of the Central Region of Ghana. Paul owns a welding company. He has been in business for the past 20 years. He is the founder of the company and has built the company up from scratch. Today, he has five permanent employees and more than 10 part-time workers. His company manufactures a whole range of products, including housing features and household appliances. His company is even able to remodel scrapped cars. Paul is beloved by the local community due to  his innovations. Prior to this invention, Ghanaians in his community used natural materials such as bamboo and palm leaves to build makeshift shelters for outdoor events such as funerals and soccer matches. These lacked structural integrity and did not provide adequate shelter in rain; in fact, when the rain came, people would abandon the shelter and run away! An extremely enterprising and creative man, Paul designed a cost-effective canopy comprising a metal framework with a waterproof canvas. This product was immensely well-received by consumers. Even then, he did not remain content with this breakthrough and has continually improved this product based on consumer feedback. He has since furnished the design with fluorescent light and electric fans, allowing these temporary shelters to provide not only safety, but also utility and comfort. Paul's most recent endeavor is the manufacturing of clean-cook stoves (a.k.a the Elsa biochar Stove) that utilise waste-products, such as palm-kennel shells, as fuel. This stove is the product of a research project by the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States and co-financed by the European Union (EU). He is now applying for a micro-loan to purchase raw materials such as metal plates in bulk to take advantage of large discount to reduce material cost. Paul is very ambitious and excited about this product.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Because of these challenges, life became difficult for her until she saw GHAPE as a source of relief in the year 20004. in that year she received her first loan of 20,000 FRS,then 60,000 FRS in 2005 and 150,00 FRS in 2006. \r\n\r\nCeline is now requesting a loan of 150,000 FRS so she can buy tomatoes, beans, spices, and so forth. She is convinced the business will succeed because of her long experience in the business, and she already has a ready market for her goods. She plans to use the profit from the loan to pay for her children's school fees and to cloth them. This business helps her community by supplying food locally, reducing the distance people need to travel to buy food. \r\n\t\r\nCeline prefers to receive loans from GHAPE because of the training GHAPE provides before disbursing loan and the follow up GHAPE provides after the loan is disbursed.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and the alleviation of poverty through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":252042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

However, they are take care of his granddaughters, the children of their oldest daughter, who has left them.  When their children were young, Modesto had a successful shop.  Because of his love for his oldest daughter, he left her in charge of managing the shop.  However, she did not know the value of the confidence he instilled in her and she squandered the money and drove the shop into bankruptcy.  Subsequently, Modesto began selling powdered spices and vegetables.  His wife cooks for diners whom they sell lunch to daily and  Modesto is in charge of taking care of their customers.  He also does some farming in the afternoons.  However, what he is most interested in is running a business, since during his life as a business man he has been able to make a good living.  He works very hard and treats his clients well, so much so that they have told us about it.  This is his third loan with MFP.  During his previous loans he has demonstrated responsibility and been on time with each of his payments.  They highlight that Modesto is a very noble man of good character and is generous.  At each of the community bank meetings he always appears to be asleep and his friends joke around with him but never gets upset.  The money from the loan will be used to increase his inventory.  He will be able to purchase more foodstuffs and will be able to make his business profitable once again.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matthew Raimondi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":325586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase his inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-29T05:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1361.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996848}],"funded_date":"2009-05-29T13:07:09Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Raimondi","image":549898}},{"id":115418,"name":"Samina Muhammad Arshad Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farzana baji wants a loan to buy clothes to sell. \r\n<p>\r\nBushra baji and Sadia parveen baji each want a loan to buy a sewing machine for sewing clothes. \r\n<p>\r\nHamidan baji wants a loan to buy garments to sell. \r\n<p>\r\nSamina baji is a wife of M.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She studied until high school. She is a merchant and has 3 children (1 girl and 2 boys). She has been selling crafts (decorations made with a breadcrumb paste) for 6 years. She asks for a loan to invest in merchandise and help her business to grow.

Loans are divided among the group to pay back. \r\n\r\nWe thank you for your support on behalf of D., the Paz and Amor group, and the entire team at Esperanza International."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":184660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase pants, blouses, shoes, perfumes, and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Puerto Plata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.75 -70.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2008-08-01T22:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dieudonne Jean Jacqu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alcy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suzette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rilanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2008-09-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-19T07:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4289.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":330205},{"amount":125,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2008-10-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-19T07:12:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4289.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364259},{"amount":125,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4289.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312810},{"amount":125,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4289.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9930357},{"amount":125,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4289.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854931},{"amount":125,"local_amount":4166.65,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4289.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20394213}],"funded_date":"2008-08-04T05:09:16Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T08:11:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":62167,"name":"Khaitgul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khaitgul A. is 36 years old.

They rent out suits for children and adults, and shoes.  The merchandise that they rent is purchased in Gamarra - Lima.  Gamarra is a large commercial and industrial center in Peru, and it is big in the field of textiles for business people.  We can find a variety of options for whatever age there.  The products they make are exported to other countries.\r\n\r\nThis communal bank has worked with EDAPROSPO-PROPERIDAD for one year.  During that time Jessica continues to be the treasurer of the group.  Before starting in the business of renting gentlemen\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing, Jessica V. U. studied design and production in an educational and occupational center.  Thanks to her work making and repairing clothes she got together the necessary capital to invest in renting clothing.  At the beginning she bought 20 suits for adults and 10 for children, one dozen pairs of children\u2019s shoes, one dozen ties, and one dozen shirts.  Six years have passed, and she appreciates that the business has grown a lot.  Everything is due to the dedication and perseverance she had when confronted with the problems that all businesses have.  Today, at 29 years old, she has 100 suits for adults, 90 for children, 5 dozen pairs of shoes, 4 dozen ties, and 8 dozen shirts.  Every half year she has to update her merchandise due to her discriminating customers who go with the changing fashions.  Her sales have made it possible for her to acquire a small piece of land, which she plans to build on later.  She would also like to rent another place so that it will not take more than two years to get together the money that is needed to start a family.  That is why she needs a loan.\r\n\r\n Sof\u00eda F. H. started working as a helper in a bookstore that her aunt ran.  The business did not turn out the way she hoped.  She then had to work in golf clubs selling candy, ice cream, cotton candy, and popcorn.  But, this income was not enough to support her and her baby.  Three years ago she set up a business of renting clothing for women and girls.  At the start she helped her aunt in the business, and then she became partners with her.  She bought 15 dresses for women and girls.  Her dedication and effort caused her sales to grow, and she has come to have 200 dresses and 50 pairs of shoes for women and girls.  With this income she educates her son, buys food, and pays for her studies in primary education at the university.  She will use this loan to pay for her last semester at the university, and the other part of the loan she will put into her business.\r\n\r\nRita Alegr\u00eda E. also rents dresses and suits for special social events.  She and a friend started with a small quantity of merchandise two years ago.  Like the others, she buys merchandise in Gamarra if she wants clothing, and she gets shoes in footwear shops.  She updates her clothes every so often.  She needs the loan to get more merchandise because the spring season and school promotions (November and December) are approaching.  There is a greater demand during those months, and her income increases.  She wants to build a room in her mother\u2019s house for her 13 year old son to be more comfortable.  She wants to have an adequate quality of life for herself and her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3575,"image":{"id":394904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy textile products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-10-07T07:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3575,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessica Leonidas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Larissa Marisela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azucena Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodolfo Eusebio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Jessica Karina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma Rebeca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga Iris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rita Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crumaldina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ofelia Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":10200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2040},{"due_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2040},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2040},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2040},{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2040}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":715},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":715},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":715},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":715},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":715}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":715,"local_amount":2040,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2052.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939354},{"amount":715,"local_amount":2040,"processed_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2052.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780194},{"amount":715,"local_amount":2040,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2052.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669062},{"amount":1430,"local_amount":4080,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4104.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064522}],"funded_date":"2009-10-29T20:10:14Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":144193,"name":"Jesus Loves You Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jesus Loves You is a group of five borrowers led by Irantatie P., a 50-year-old married woman with five children.

He has 2 children who are in the care of their mom.  Originally, he worked together in the same business as his mother. Over the years, he has decided to become independent and start his own business.  Thus, he comes to our institution, with Emprender being the place where he took out his first loan.  Due to familiarity and how well it's going for him, he is requesting a loan renewal.  He is a young man who has the desire to overcome challenges and hope for a future in which he would have a business that has expanded beyond what he currently has in order to provide for his children

She is 32 years old. Gelane is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nGelane is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Gelane owns & operates a general store selling a variety of different products in the local community. Gelane has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Gelane joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gelane has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Gelane is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Gelane from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He divorced his wife a year ago, and sees his two young children on weekends.  He has done agricultural work since he was 8, having grown coffee, bananas, citrus fruits and pineapple on land that he owns.  Sometimes he receives help from his relatives, but at harvest time he has to contract labor to speed up the work.  He likes to harvest the coffee beans, pulp them, wash them, then select the ones to sell to the wholesalers who know the quality of his crop and who will pay considerable sums.  Planting coffee is very profitable, allowing him to purchase his necessities, and to cover his expenses and those of his children.  Therefore, for the future he plans to increase his production of this crop.  \r\n\r\nThis is the second time he has taken a loan through MFP, and he is very proud to continue to work with his communal group, with persons he considers to be honest, hard-working and responsible.  With the loan he is requesting, he will buy two thousand more coffee plants and sacks of fertilizer to revitalize his plantations.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford, Kiva

Immaculate attributes her progress to hard work and determination.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":608324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"The purchase of more vegetables to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Immaculate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Resty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suyina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hadijja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zayina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bayati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":483333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":483333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":483333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":483333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":483333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":483333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":216.67,"local_amount":483332,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":485873.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467722},{"amount":229.56,"local_amount":512085,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:10Z","rounded_local_amount":514777.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605811},{"amount":168.6,"local_amount":376100,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":378077.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744867},{"amount":170.09,"local_amount":379432,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:05:45Z","rounded_local_amount":381427.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191482991},{"amount":233.59,"local_amount":521085,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:00:15Z","rounded_local_amount":523825.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195909698},{"amount":281.49,"local_amount":627966,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-18T08:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":631268.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201352208}],"funded_date":"2010-10-04T02:05:44Z","paid_date":"2011-04-18T08:10:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Pierce","image":518671}},{"id":239205,"name":"Doracy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Doracy moved to the US with hopes of replicating the lingerie store that she owned in Brazil.

L\u00ea Th\u1ecb (2020103009) is a 46-year-old woman who lives in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 3 adult children.  To making a living, N. owns & operates a restaurant where she serves a variety of different meals to customers in the local community.  N. has been engaged in this business for over 18 years and earns approximately 3.300.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, N. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  N. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6.048.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase food & drinks for the restaurant.  N. is now requesting a new loan of 8.736.000 VND which will be used to purchase food & drinks for the restaurant.  The loan will be N.'s 5th loan from SEDA.  N. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

She is a married woman who has seven children. Five of them are currently pursuing education in the junior and senior high schools. Theresa\u2019s husband is a food crop farmer. Theresa and her family live at a family house in Oda in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Most of the inhabitants of Oda are either into farming or trade in farm products. Very few people run different types of business. \n\nTheresa trades in clothing materials and jewelry. She buys textile fabrics, bedspreads, and all kinds of brand new clothes, including ladies\u2019 wear and men\u2019s wear, from Accra, a nearby city, and sells them in her shop in the market square in her community.

She sells to all types of people, both retail and wholesale. Teddy buys secondhand clothes from Owino Market, one of the busiest markets in Uganda.  She goes shopping once a week.\r\n\r\nTeddy wants to use this loan to buy more bales of secondhand clothes.  She has been in this business for fifteen years. Besides this clothing business, she also gets additional income from rental rooms.  Teddy works seven days a week, and her business challenges include transportation and seasonality. She aspires to go directly into importing these clothes.\r\n\r\nTeddy decided to work with MCDT because they work with women who are in groups. Teddy resides in and owns a two-room house, and the family has access to electricity but no piped water. Her monthly expenses include paying utility bills and school fees.

This area is characterized by crop and livestock farming. \r\n\r\nPedro has for a number of years devoted himself to caring for and selling goats. His pens are located to the rear of his house and are appropriate and spacious. He feeds them with a commercially prepared feed and natural grasses, so that his animals may reach optimal growth in order to offer them at the various markets in the area and thus obtain much better earnings to cover daily living costs in his home. \r\n\r\nHe has sought a loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 2,500 Peruvian soles to purchase commercial feed for his animals and make repairs to the kitchen in his home. With the income he will receive from the sale of his goals he can cover the loan and improve the quality of life of his family. Pedro is a hardworking and very responsible person. His sole wish is that his family would improve itself economically in order to avail themselves of additional comforts. \r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":864417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase feed for his animals and make repairs to his kitchen. \r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mochum\u00ed - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-09-10T22:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":169.35},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":185.3},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":183.9},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":187.9},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":200.15},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":202.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":209.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":219.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":225.1},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":230.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":240.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":245.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.05},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.09},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.61},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.12},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.4},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.66,"local_amount":169.35,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":170.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232780195},{"amount":68.56,"local_amount":185.3,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-22T08:54:29Z","rounded_local_amount":187.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238584734},{"amount":68.04,"local_amount":183.9,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":185.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244542900},{"amount":143.58,"local_amount":388.05,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":391.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250753396},{"amount":75.09,"local_amount":202.95,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":204.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263290987},{"amount":77.61,"local_amount":209.75,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":211.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270011823},{"amount":81.12,"local_amount":219.25,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":221.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276620968},{"amount":348.34,"local_amount":941.45,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":950.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332356}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T06:51:23Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T14:10:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meg Wolfe-Roberts","image":555476}}]}
