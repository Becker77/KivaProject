Finding himself at a disadvantage, he is here to request a loan of $600, which will enable him to realize his dream of making more from his line of work.  \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nN\u00e9 \u00e0 Djita en 1972, Monsieur A.

He is married and the father of 3 children. Bakhtiyor is an optimistic, hardworking father. He works his land with love and dedication every day, so that it produces excellent vegetables. He also raises cattle. <p>\r\n\r\nBakhtiyor has been working the land for two years. He learned this skill from his beloved father (pictured) who takes care of his land when Bakhtiyor travels to the market to sell his produce and cattle. His loving wife is also involved in the family business, as you can see in the photo. <p>\r\n\r\nThough growing vegetables is a very difficult and timetaking job, he hopes to gather a rich harvest.

Bakhtiyor thanks your generous hearts for a swift contribution. <p>\r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve the agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History:<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Although her children do not live under the same roof, she watches over them.  She lives in her own house and wants her children to have the best of lives. Martina has a stand selling sweets which is very popular as it is located in one of the most important parks in the city of Juliaca.  She is a very convincing saleswoman and always persuades people to take something to eat on their way.  She has had this business for 8 years and what she most likes it to talk with her neighboring saleswomen but what she likes least it to remain at her stand all day in the inclement sun and without being able to go anywhere.  In the future she hopes to have a store to be able to work with greater ease.

She doesn\u2019t incur any transport costs to and from buying food because she works at the very market where she buys the food. \r\n<p>\r\nAisha works seven days a week in a semi urban area which is on the outskirts of Kampala. She receives an average of 20 customers a day and sells to all categories of people in retail and wholesale. She has a restaurant in Owino Market and sells all types of food plus tea. Her major business challenge is ever increasing prices of food due to famine in many villages of Uganda. She has been in this business for over ten years and with MCDT for five years, now servicing her fifteenth loan. Aisha joined MCDT because it was near her home and it was easy to work with. She wants to use this loan to buy more bunches of bananas, cassava, and sweet potatoes.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting breadfruit for sale.  Siatuvai has 5 years of experience in this business.  Siatuvai needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 190 tala or US $79 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Siatuvai joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Siatuvai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Siatuvai E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.22 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Shuhrat is a 29-year-old married man. With great sacrifice he works in farming, tending his crops, and at the same time processes dried apricots to sell. It is important to emphasize that he is the father of two children and is obligated to take care of them and provide all that they need.\r\n\r\nNow, Shuhrat is looking for the support of IMON International to obtain a loan which he will use to buy more dried apricots for processing and later selling. His dream is to improve his economic activity and for this he looks to the support of Kiva, trusting that he will receive the needed support.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in Cerro del Marqu\u00e9z, Valle D. Chalco Solidaridad in the state of Mexico.  She is an active member of UD. Estrellita.\r\n\r\nAna Lilia has been selling robes, overalls, and reflective vests.  She began selling these articles out of necessity, now that her children have started school and her husband\u2019s income was not enough to cover expenses.  Due to her economic situation, she decided to look for a loan.  She learned of Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad through a friend, who invited her to join the group.  This motivates her very much because it provides her the opportunity of obtaining a loan to invest in merchandise and increase her earnings.  This way she will be able to become more economically solvent.\r\n\r\nHer priority at the moment is the education of four of her five children.

CDI was designed to address problems related to deterioration of livestock health and productivity, which has lead to declines in the quantity and quality of meat and dairy in the region.\r\n\r\nSurma S., 52, is a leader of this group. She lives in Kadamjai. She is left with her grandchildren, while all three of her kids left to Russia to earn income.  Recently her son gave her a good idea. He suggested sending his earnings to her, so that she can purchase dairy cattle for starting a small business. But she\u2019s afraid it won\u2019t be enough for a business start-up. So Surma applied for this loan in hopes of increasing the number of cattle and build a house from the proceeds.

This canton is known for its beautiful landscape, its forests, the variety of its fauna and also for its kind and hard-working people who mainly work in farming and livestock raising.\r\n\r\nHere we meet 32 year-old Carla.  Carla was previously married but separated from her husband two years ago and now lives in her parents' home.  She has been a member of her community bank for two years and she likes it for the camaraderie.\r\n\r\nCarla's business is selling all types of clothes.  She makes her sales door to door and also sells from her parents' home to customers who come to her.  She works every day from 9.00am to 3.00pm, leaves her goods on credit and collects payment every week.

He attends 10th grade, and supports two brothers. He explains that he has always lived with his parents, studied, and found ways early on to help the family by selling essential products in the yard of the family home, which is in the Chali district of Catembe (across the bay from Maputo). For the last four years, he has also worked for Generics & Specialists Lda. selling pharmaceuticals. For 2 years he has been running his grocery store on good common sense; he has no business or other degree. The store has one salaried employee, has a business license, and is open from 8:00a.m. to 9:30p.m. \r\n<p>\r\nSamuel became acquainted with Hluvuku through friends and colleagues, and has already repaid his first loan with no trouble. With a loan of 10,000 MT, he intends to bolster his grocery store with products such as rice, beans, peanuts, corn meal, and soft drinks. He acquires his products in Catembe and rents a wagon to transport them. The best periods are weekends in the summer and at the end of the month, when supply is better. His daily revenue is 1,000 MT, and his most profitable product is soft drinks.\r\n<p>\r\nAccording to Samuel, the business has reached a good rhythm, with a monthly profit of 2,000 MT. With the business profits, he is able to support his family, increase volume, make home improvements, and put away savings. In the future, with additional loans, he intends to expand and diversify the products that he can offer his customers. He is thrilled with the credit extended to him, because it has substantially improved his business.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by Steve Fogel, Kiva volunteer<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nCliente:

She is married and the mother of five children.  Aside from caring for her family and her home, Gulnoz has a grocery store which she attends to herself.

The business has been gradually growing ever since.  From the profit from her business Gulnoz was able to arrange the wedding of her two elder sons and is  planning to educate the rest of her children and to arrange their weddings too.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

De joven se dedic\u00f3 a realizar los trabajos agr\u00edcolas, actividad heredada de sus padres; pero para \u00e9l la agricultura, algunas veces, es de escasa producci\u00f3n y muchas veces no se recupera lo invertido. Por ello que hace 5 a\u00f1os viene dedic\u00e1ndose a la crianza de cuyes, pero sin dejar sus cultivos de papa, ni alverjas que en ciertas temporadas le son muy rentables. Su mayor tiempo les dedica a sus animales, ya que quiere convertirse en un empresario exitoso. Inici\u00f3 su negocio con cuyes de una raza menor, pero ahora est\u00e1 cambiando a una raza de mejor calidad, participando en todas las ferias agropecuarias para exhibir a sus roedores. Walter nos muestra en la foto, orgulloso, su \u201ccobaya\u201d, de un tama\u00f1o considerable. Para la alimentaci\u00f3n de sus cuyes siembra alfalfa en sus chacras de riego, ya que con pasar de los meses sus animales se est\u00e1n incrementado y eso le demanda mayor cantidad de pasto. \u00c9l est\u00e1 muy feliz porque este negocio le ha permitido relacionarse con ingenieros, de quienes pudo obtener informaci\u00f3n muy valiosa para mejorar su actividad. Este es el cuarto pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP, donde todo este tiempo vino pagando de forma muy puntual, asimismo ha cumplido la funci\u00f3n de tesorero, cargo que cumpli\u00f3 con mucha honestidad y cabe mencionar que es el \u00fanico var\u00f3n en su banco comunal, por lo cual es el m\u00e1s querido por el resto de las socias. En esta oportunidad ha decidido en invertir en la compra de chacras sembradas de alfalfa o avena para alimentar a sus 200 cuyes, as\u00ed como en la compra de fertilizante para sus cultivos de papas. ","en":"Walter is 46 years old.  He is a very self-sacrificing head of the family and has \"a thousand jobs\".  He has 3 children and owns his own home.  From the time he was young, he has done agricultural work, an activity he inherited from his parents.  But for him, agriculture sometimes results in scarce production and many times he does not recoup his investment.  For this reason, he has been raising guinea pigs for the past 5 years, though he has not stopped planting potatoes and peas, which in certain seasons are very profitable.\r\n\r\nWalter dedicates most of his time to his animals, as he wants to become a successful business owner.  He started his business with guinea pigs of a lower quality, but now he is upgrading to a lineage of better quality, participating in all of the livestock fairs to exhibit his rodents.  In the picture, Walter proudly shows us his female guinea pig, which is quite large.  \r\n\r\nIn order to feed his guinea pigs, he plants alfalfa in irrigated plots, since with the passing of the months he has more animals and requires more pasture.  He is very happy because this job has enabled him to work with engineers, from whom has is able to obtain very useful information to improve his business.  \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan that he has taken out from MFP, and he has always paid very punctually.  He has also served as the treasurer, a role he performed with great integrity.  It is also worth noting he is the only man in his communal bank, and is therefore the favorite of the rest of the female members.  With this loan he has decided to purchase fields planted with alfalfa or oats to feed his 200 guinea pigs, as well as fertilizer for his potato crops. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":315715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase feed for his animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-10T23:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3519.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733841}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T13:22:01Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":110998,"name":"Charmalou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Charmalou U. has a business called \"Char's Lech\u00f3n Retailer and Longganiza\", selling pork.

In 2006, Joan joined ASHI in order to have access to credit, which enabled her to put up her own business and own source of income to augment her husband's. \r\n\r\nWhen Joan started with her fish buy and sell business, she only sold a small volume of fish since her business capital was small. After several loans from ASHI and after showing her good performance in attendance during weekly center meeting, repayment, and business, she was allowed to have a larger loan. Eventually her business grew. The volume of fish she bought and sold increased. She also saved with ASHI every week. \r\n\r\nWith Joan's new loan, she plans to add crab, shrimp, and prawn to the variety of fish she sells. Jerry has been very happy for Joan's business since they can work together and have the opportunity to run their own business. Joan and Jerry can't wait for their business and their savings to grow because they want to have a fishpond of their own. Joan is praying that her business will be successful and that she and Jerry will be able to sustain their family's financial needs.\r\n\r\n

For the past year, she has been dedicated to breeding chickens, and she has a small, well equipped shed in her own house. The whole family helps to take care of the chickens. Roly enjoys taking good care of her chickens so that they reach the proper size and weight for selling them. As a side job, she sells fish to other cites, and she has been doing this for 5 months and this is also going very well for her. \r\n\r\nAs for the future, Roly wants to buy land that she can use to build larger, better equipped sheds that will accommodate a larger population of chickens. This is her third loan with MFP, and the thing she likes the most about her community bank is that there is a lot of harmony between all the members, and they are very committed to punctuality of their balances. With the money that she has asked for, she will buy more chickens and sufficient food for their growth.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mitchell Usher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":385427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of chickens and their food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-09T01:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":154.42},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":156.54},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":161.86},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":169.27},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":176.04},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":181.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.79},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.65},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.24},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.62},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.05,"local_amount":154.42,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":158.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081320},{"amount":54.79,"local_amount":156.54,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":160.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997480},{"amount":56.65,"local_amount":161.86,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":165.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842826},{"amount":184.51,"local_amount":527.18,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-19T10:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":540.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734405}],"funded_date":"2009-09-09T09:09:53Z","paid_date":"2010-01-19T10:53:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mitchell Usher","image":null}},{"id":139726,"name":"Lucena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucena G. is from the village of Mialen, Clarin, Misamis Occidental.

En este momento el \u00fanico capital que soportaba este segundo negocio era el producido por los bolis y casi siempre se quedaba corta en responder con mercanc\u00edas a sus clientes; fue entonces cuando Ana, su vecina y amiga, percibiendo su capacidad emprendedora y su ya reconocido sentido de responsabilidad en el barrio, le recomend\u00f3 acercarse a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo para que la apoyaran con un cr\u00e9dito y desde entonces no ha dejado de participar en los programas de esta entidad, ella reconoce que este ha sido un capital adicional que ha mejorado su oferta de productos en cantidad y en calidad.\n  \nA Patricia siempre le ha gustado ser independiente, su c\u00f3nyuge es polic\u00eda y  tienen dos hijos menores de edad; su esposo y su cu\u00f1ada que es docente, le ayudan a seleccionar sus clientela entre sus amigos de trabajo es decir los que mejor pagan;  ella tambi\u00e9n compra calzado, prendas de plata, oro golfi, electrodom\u00e9sticos que no est\u00e1n en la gu\u00eda de productos y que le piden sus clientes; esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual ellos la prefieren y su negocio se ha extendido, ya que siempre les vende lo que estos le encargan; su actual aspiraci\u00f3n es obtener un cr\u00e9dito por valor de $2.000.000 para comprar prendas de plata y de oro a solicitud  de los mas rentables.\n\nPara esta joven mujer, el tener un negocio le ha fortalecido su car\u00e1cter independiente, con sus utilidades ella paga la seguridad social y puede incluir a sus padres; tiene una hermosa  y ordenada vivienda, producto del inter\u00e9s de su esposo y  de ella por vivir cada d\u00eda mejor; ha logrado tambi\u00e9n hacer optimas adecuaciones en su casa, como los pisos, la puerta, los closets; le encanta su esposo porque \u00e9l no limita su capacidad de so\u00f1ar ni sus decisiones de inversi\u00f3n, pues \u00e9l reconoce que todo le da un resultado exitoso. \n\nPatricia H. es una mujer polifac\u00e9tica, ama el trabajo que realiza, por eso tambi\u00e9n participa en actividades, que apoyan la seguridad alimentaria de familias pobres y estimulan el mejoramiento y la recuperaci\u00f3n en los niveles de nutrici\u00f3n de ni\u00f1os con dificultades alimenticias o expuestos a ella; all\u00ed de la mano de una organizaci\u00f3n ubicada cerca de su vivienda, realiza  acciones formativas y ense\u00f1a a identificar como conseguir alimentos a madres y personas responsables de menores en riesgo alimentario; ha participado en programas de siembra de huertas en los patios de familias especiales,  labores mencionadas con la que obtiene algunos ingresos adicionales que fortalecen  el desarrollo  familiar, pues su sue\u00f1o est\u00e1 proyectado en ofrecer estudios profesionales y especializados a sus hijos y respecto a su negocio planea desarrollar una infraestructura s\u00f3lida que le permita desde su vivienda tener  exhibidores y contratar personas a las que pueda pagar un salario que beneficie a su familia.\nUno de los retos que ha enfrentado fue cuando se presentaron problemas de salud en su familia y  se qued\u00f3 sin capital teniendo que empezar nuevamente;  Patricia H. es una excelente miembro de familia, conciente de sus obligaciones morales y con una gran capacidad de riesgo calculado que hacen de ella una mujer con una enorme proyecci\u00f3n futura.\n\n","en":"In the July 20th neighborhood tenement, there is a place near the Metropolitan Stadium in Barranquilla where soccer games are played and the neighbors are happy and supportive of one another.  This place is the neighborhood where Patricia H. A. lives.  She is 32 years old and has enjoyed being independent from a young age.  Patricia started a home business making popsicles and frozen drinks packed in plastic bags.  Her products are prepared naturally and consist of the most delicious tropical fruits of the region including guava, mango, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Soursop\" target=\"_blank\" >soursop<\/a>, coconut, banana, and pineapple.  By serving these refreshments, Patricia became known in the community and gradually attracted business before she was presented with an opportunity to start selling general merchandise through specialized guides.  She eventually started her new retail business in which she visited customers to demonstrate the products shown in the catalog prior to taking their orders.  Patricia delivers the goods to the homes of her customers and started offering credit payment plans that require an initial down payment.  At the moment, her only source of capital for this second business comes from selling popsicles.  However, she was always short of the funds needed to fulfill her customers\u2019 orders.  It was at this point that Ana, a friend and neighbor, took note of her entrepreneurship and suggested that she visit Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for a loan.  Since then, she has continued to participate in the programs offered by the organization.  The additional capital issued to Patricia has improved both the quantity and quality of her product offerings.\r\n<p>\r\nPatricia\u2019s husband is a policeman and they have two dependent children.  Her sister-in-law is a teacher and helps find customers among her friends at work who are more likely to pay.  Patricia also sells shoes, silver plated ornaments, imitation gold, and appliances that are not offered in her product catalog but requested by her customers.  For this reason, her customers prefer to buy from her, which has led to an expansion of her business since Patricia is willing to sell them whatever they need.   Her current goal is to obtain a loan of 2,000,000 COP to buy silver and gold ornaments since these items are the most profitable.\r\n<p>\r\nFor Patricia, having a business means establishing her status as an independent woman.  With her earnings, she is able to pay Social Security so that she can support her parents and still maintain a beautiful and orderly home.  This is a by-product of the willingness of her and her husband to live a better life each day.  They have been able to make optimal improvements to their home by adding floors, doors, and closets.  Patricia loves her husband because he does not limit her ability to dream or make investment decisions.  He acknowledges that her choices have resulted in successful outcomes.\r\n<p>\r\nPatricia H. is a multifaceted woman.  She enjoys her work, but she also participates in activities that support the feeding of the poor and encourage improving the nutritional levels of children who do not have enough to eat.  Patricia lends a hand to an organization near her home that identifies mothers and guardians of children at risk and teaches them about proper nutrition.  She has participated in programs that plant gardens in the yards of families with special needs.  The revenue generated from this program goes to fund programs that strengthen family development.  Her dream is to provide specialized training to educators and other professionals who work with children.  As for her business, she wants to develop a solid program in which exhibitors can sell from their home and then hire employees and pay them a wage that will allow them to support their families.  One of the challenges she faces is the existence of health problems in her family.  She ran out of capital and is now having to rebuild.  Patricia is an integral member of her family who is aware of her moral obligations.  She has a great capacity for taking calculated risks necessary to map out her future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She lives with her husband in the rural community of Vichayal, located in the District of Tuman, half an hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nDoris has run a vegetable stand in the Tuman city market for the last ten years. Every day she goes to work, offering her customers cassava [yuca root], corn, onions, potatoes, and all sorts of legumes and root vegetables. This enterprise is a great help to her family's finances because her husband is a field worker for the local agrobusiness company and his income is not enough to cover all of the household expenses.\r\n\r\nDoris has told us that thanks to her business she has been able to help her two children get ahead in life. Both are now grown and living independently. Her sales are good because she always tries to sell fresh products and offer her customers a good deal. Doris would like to expand her business by purchasing more goods to sell. This is why she is asking Edpyme Alternativa [a Kiva Field Partner] for a loan of 1000 Peruvian Soles to help her meet her goal.\r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to be able to live in the city so that she doesn't have to make the long trip each day back and forth from her home to the market. She has worked with Edpyme Alternativa before and has been responsible and on-time with her repayments. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":497922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of merchandise to expand her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Vichayal - Tuman - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-02-27T17:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":85.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":90.39},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":92.32},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":93.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":99.01},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":104.3},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":108.14},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":110.89},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":114.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.09},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.14},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.13},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.11},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.58},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.09,"local_amount":85.56,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":91.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934653},{"amount":33.89,"local_amount":90.39,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":96.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662256},{"amount":34.62,"local_amount":92.32,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":98.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694960},{"amount":35.14,"local_amount":93.71,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":100.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878006},{"amount":37.13,"local_amount":99.01,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":105.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618035},{"amount":37.85,"local_amount":100.93,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:45Z","rounded_local_amount":107.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832438},{"amount":39.11,"local_amount":104.3,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":111.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099046},{"amount":125.17,"local_amount":333.78,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":356.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554498}],"funded_date":"2010-02-27T20:33:20Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

This group is maD. up of 6 members who know each other because they are neighbors and area merchants.  Bibiana H. is the representative of the group.  She is 40 years old, and finished her secondary education.  She has 4 children, 2 boys and 2 girls, they are: Isaias, 16, Eliel, 18, Judith, 20, and Gabriela, 24.   For 10 years she has been selling food such as rice tacos, sopes, hamburgers, hot dogs, etc.  Bibiana decided to start her business in her home so that she could meet the needs of her family, as her husband's earnings did not cover all the expenses and her children were in school.\r\n\r\nNow she requests a loan to buy meat, cooking oil, soft drinks, napkins and seasonings.  Bibiana tells us that \"currently, I attend to more than 50 customers and my greatest satisfaction is that my customers tell me that my food is delicious.\"  With this business she has earnings that she can use for her personal expenses, and she can also use part of the earnings to invest in more supplies to continue the business.\r\n\r\nBibiana tells us that, \"In my community of Marcelino Rodriguez, the climate is very hot and there is a very pretty plantation and a river that passes through the middle of  the town.  You should visit this safe place, I know that you will enjoy it.  All of us are very grateful for the support that you have provided us, and that now is being provided through Kiva.\"  \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are Bibiana H. H., who sells food, Reina M. D. J., who buys ears of corn from farms and sells them in bulk, Marcela M.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Incas, about one hour from Cusco. Our members make native food to sell while working at home. The majority of them make the food at home and then bring it to the commercial ovens of friends to be cooked. The principal job of two of the members is to sell the food and cakes at the main bus stop.

L. is from the village of Gata Diot, Clarin, Misamis Occidental. She is 60 years old. Raymunda is widowed and has 2 adult-aged children. To make a living, Raymunda owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Raymunda has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 13000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Raymunda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Raymunda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12000 PHP from GDMPC. Raymunda is requesting a new loan which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Raymunda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Saodat tries to offer good prices to her customers while still making a profit. Saodat has requested a loan of 4300 somoni to increase her inventory. This is a busy time for many market vendors as the cold season is coming and everyone is preparing for the winter season. By purchasing additional inventory, Saodat will be better prepared to meet the increased demand and earn a good income.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His dream is to keep growing as an entrepreneur to give his family a better quality of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Duque, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":490517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy basic household goods to expand his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Paijan - Ascope - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-02-20T00:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hermes Nicolas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":88.64},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":88.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":91.3},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":95.14},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":98.21},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100.79},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":104.15},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":107.27},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":111.7},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":114.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.24},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.24},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.68},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.79},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.06},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.22},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.89},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.24,"local_amount":88.64,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:38Z","rounded_local_amount":94.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934603},{"amount":33.13,"local_amount":88.35,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":94.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662208},{"amount":34.24,"local_amount":91.3,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":97.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694911},{"amount":35.68,"local_amount":95.14,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":101.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877958},{"amount":36.83,"local_amount":98.21,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":104.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617992},{"amount":37.79,"local_amount":100.79,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":107.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832392},{"amount":39.06,"local_amount":104.15,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":111.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099009},{"amount":125.03,"local_amount":333.42,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":356.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554464}],"funded_date":"2010-02-26T21:58:15Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":181407,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence is 32 years of age and married with four children aged between 10 and 16 years.

The full name of this locality is San Lu\u00eds de Cumbe, and it is located in the southeast part of the city of Cuenca.  The majority of residents are dedicated to farming and raising livestock.  This bank is comprised of enterprising women who are always in search of a better standard of living.  They are managing this through their daily work, which makes them very proud.  On this occasion, we are accompanied by Mr. Eulogio Rojas, Regional Coordinator for Azuay, together with our other members. \r\n\r\nDigna C. is one of our own.  She lives in a newly completed home in the San Vicente community, along with her husband who works in construction.  They have three children, ages 4, 3 and 1.  Digna is 23 years old, and has dedicated herself to embroidery for the past eight years, an art form that she learned from her mother.  She works alone from her house, dividing her time between her craft and tending to the household chores.  She doesn\u2019t have a fixed schedule, as her work can vary depending on the number of orders she has.  She also raises guinea pigs and chickens, both for the family\u2019s consumption and to sell in the event they find themselves in a financial bind.  This is the fifth loan cycle for this cooperative bank, and the loan requested would be used to invest in more guinea pigs and chickens as she would like to raise additional animals.\r\n\r\nRosa Alejandrina P. is 43 years old, and another member of this bank.  She lives with three of her five children, as the two oldest kids are married and living independently.  Her 18-year old son works in construction, helping to support the household.  Her 15-year old daughter helps her with the house and caring for the animals.  Only her youngest is studying at the local school.  Her husband has lived abroad for eleven years, helping them out financially.  Thanks to their efforts and sacrifice, they managed to build their own home.  They are in their fourth cycle with the cooperative bank, thanks to the invitation from a member.  With previous loans, she bought some guinea pigs and chickens, but she also dedicates herself to embroidery of traditional garments.  She learned this skill on her own, and has been doing it for twelve years.  She will use the loan to buy threads and fabric with which to make her garments.  Her goal is to have a larger workshop, and to be able to teach this lovely art form to more women in her locality.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

With this loan, Marie Chantal will purchase a variety of goods, mainly foodstuffs, which in turn will allow her to satisfy the demands of her customers.  If successful, Marie Chantal will hopefully earn more profits and these profits will allow her to keep reinvesting in her business for better financial stability.  In addition to that, she will continue taking care of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":608150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a variety of goods to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kigali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.953611 30.060556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-09-28T00:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie Chantal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T11:53:12Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177616879},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:50:02Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182623080},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:55:41Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188760901},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191497825},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195926114},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:20:39Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201368020},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206233032},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211308321}],"funded_date":"2010-09-28T09:19:34Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T12:08:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":238881,"name":"Channy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Channy L. is a widow with four sons and one daughter.

Murodjon is a very courageous man who is characterized as someone who can manage tough jobs like raising livestock. He's the father of three children and has the responsibility of supporting his family and providing them with everything that they need. \r\n\r\nIn spite of his difficult economic situation and after much time, Murodjon has been able to get ahead in his business through the purchase of animals to breed them on his property. His greatest goal nowadays is to improve his economic situation and provide a better way of life for his family. It's for this reason that Murodjon comes to IMON International for loans for the purchase of animals so that he may breed them.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Esta agrupaci\u00f3n esta conformada por 11 personas, quienes son originarios y vecinos de esta localidad, todos ellos e conocen entre si y comparten las mismas tradiciones y costumbres, algunos son ind\u00edgenas y otros no, pero eso no es motivo por el cual no puedan estar unidos.\nEn esta narraci\u00f3n hablaremos de la se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda A. O., de 28 a\u00f1os de edad, ella es artesana de toda la vida, nos comenta que la elaboraci\u00f3n de huipiles lo practica desde hace mas de 10 a\u00f1os, cuando su cu\u00f1ada la ense\u00f1o a elaborar tan bonitas prendas antes de fallecer, ella nos cometa que es la mejor herencia que pudo haber recibido, ya que por medio de esta actividad puede obtener recursos para apoyar a sus dos peque\u00f1os hijos que son, Flor de 12 a\u00f1os y Jes\u00fas de 11 a\u00f1os de edad, ellos est\u00e1n estudiando actualmente, flor cursa la educaci\u00f3n secundaria y Jes\u00fas el sexto a\u00f1o de la primaria, el esposo de Mar\u00eda es campesino de nombre Javier quien tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad. \nEl bordado de huipiles es una actividad muy conocida y practicada  en la regi\u00f3n de la costa chica de Oaxaca principalmente donde existen poblaciones de ind\u00edgenas mixtecos, las prendas como los huipiles, las naguas, los telares, y otros han distinguido siempre a las comunidades de ind\u00edgenas, cada regi\u00f3n tiene sus propias caracter\u00edsticas y colores apropiados en estas prendas, ya que cada una de ellas representa el grupo, la clase y la distinci\u00f3n del pueblo de la persona quien porta esta preciada vestimenta, Mar\u00eda  elabora bordados y acabados de huipiles, hilados a mano, para esto se utilizan materiales propios de la regi\u00f3n, que se distinguen desde su origen hasta el detallado de las prendas.\nEl motivo por el cual Mar\u00eda solicito un cr\u00e9dito fue para la compra de materiales que utiliza en la elaboraci\u00f3n y bordados de huipiles, ella con este dinero pudo comprar listones en colores amarillo, azul rey, rojo, naranja y caf\u00e9, estos listones en diferentes presentaciones y tama\u00f1os, tambi\u00e9n compro hilo de algod\u00f3n para bordado, hilo de seda, madeja de algod\u00f3n para bordar en diferentes colores, telar de cintura hilado a mano, telar te\u00f1ido con caracol p\u00farpura, aro para bordar y algunas agujas.  \nLo que le gusta a Mar\u00eda es la combinaci\u00f3n de colores, es por eso que ella disfruta la creaci\u00f3n de sus trabajos, al principio dice que cuando viv\u00eda su cu\u00f1ada ella era que le combinaba los colores, pero  despu\u00e9s ella tuvo que hacerlo, nos comparte que en algunas ocasiones no le pagan lo justo por su trabajo, pero eso no la desanima, ella le echa mas ganas y sigue adelante, para elaborar un huipil Mar\u00eda se tarda aproximadamente una semana dedic\u00e1ndole todo un d\u00eda completo. Su oficio le ha permitido a poyar a su esposo con el gasto escolar de sus hijos, ha podido darle continuidad a su actividad y no le ha faltado lo necesario para seguir trabajando.\nSer artesana no es cosa f\u00e1cil primero porque tienen que entender que es lo que hacen, de donde viene, y que simboliza para la persona quien esta creando este arte.\nMar\u00eda desea mejorar su calidad de vida y  la de sus hijos, no pretende ganar mucho dinero solamente lo necesario para llevar una vida digna y perdurable, ella quisiera que estas prendas no se pierdan nunca y prevalezcan durante todo el tiempo, sin perder su significado y sin sufrir modificaci\u00f3n alguna.\nLa esperanza de Mar\u00eda es ver a sus hijos crecer en un ambiento propio de si mismos, sin carencias ni limitaciones, ella desea ver a sus ni\u00f1os terminar bien una preparaci\u00f3n escolar, para que el d\u00eda de ma\u00f1ana ellos puedan aspirar a algo mejor de lo que ella y su esposo no tuvieron, ya que el ser campesino es como estar destinado a vivir en la pobreza y en la carencia de una vida c\u00f3moda, ella quiere que sus ventas no decaigan, que su producci\u00f3n crezca y que su hija aprenda tambi\u00e9n este oficio como una herramienta mas de supervivencia.\n A nombre de sus compa\u00f1eros y compa\u00f1eras que integran este grupo Mar\u00eda le da las gracias a los que hacen posible este apoyo humano, de no ser por los que participan en esta labor los que est\u00e1n en la misma situaci\u00f3n de Mar\u00eda no tendr\u00edan respaldo alguno, a todo este gran equipo ella les manda un abrazo y no hay mejor agradecimiento que una sonrisa de parte de ella.\n\u201cArc\u00e1ngel Misael\u201d.

Hern\u00e1ndez is the group\u2019s leader and their meeting place is only a few steps from the place known as the Well of San Jacinto.  This is a public place, available for the entire population of Jamiltepec, where the people gather to wash clothes.  This group is made up of 11 people, originally from this area.  They are all neighbors and all know one another and share the same traditions and customs.  Some are aboriginal and others not, but that is not a reason for them not to be united. \r\n\r\nHere we will talk about 28 year old Mar\u00eda A. O..  She\u2019s been an artist her entire life and tells us that she\u2019s been making \u201chuipiles\u201d (Mayan style dresses) for more than 10 years.  Her mother in law taught her to make these beautiful clothing items, before she passed away, and [Mar\u00eda] believes that this was the greatest inheritance that she could have received, because it allows her to generate the income she needs to support her two young children; 12 year old Flor and 11 year old Jes\u00fas.  Both are in school.  Flor is in junior high school and Jes\u00fas is in sixth grade.  Her husband, 43 year old Javier, is a field worker. \r\n\r\nHuipil embroidering is well known and practiced in the La Costa Chica region of Oaxaca, particularly in areas inhabited by aboriginal people.  Clothing items such as huipiles, naguas, telares, and other types of traditional clothing, have always distinguished the aboriginal communities from one another, and each region has its own style and colors of clothing, representative of each group.  Mar\u00eda embroiders and finishes huipiles by hand, using materials from the region that distinguish the details in the clothing.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda requested this loan to buy supplies that she uses for making and embroidering huipiles, such as yellow, royal blue, red, orange, and brown ribbons of different types and size.  She also bought different types of cotton and silk thread in different colors, handmade belts, purple dyed fabric, crochet hoops and some needles.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda likes to combine colors.  This is why she enjoys her work.  When her mother in law was living, she used to combine colors for her, but then [Mar\u00eda] had to learn to do it herself.  She tells us that there are times when she is not paid fairly for her labor, but that does not discourage her.  She puts forth more effort and forges ahead.  It takes her about a week, working all day, every day, to make each huipil.  Her craft allows her to help her husband pay for their children\u2019s schooling and she has not been short of what she needs to continue her work.  This is not an easy task because one must understand where they come from, where they live, and what the craft means to its artist.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda wants to improve her children\u2019s quality of life.  She does not pretend to make much money; just enough to afford a dignified and lasting life.  She hopes that these clothing styles are never lost and that they continue without modifications. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda\u2019s hopes are to see her children grow up in their own environment, without limits or cares.  She also wants to see them get a good education so that they can aspire for something better than what she and her husband had, because being a field hand destines one to live a life of poverty with a desire for a comfortable life.  She wants her sales not to decrease and to increase her production.  She also wants her daughter to learn this art as a tool for greater achievement.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is thankful, and in the name of her fellow members, appreciates those whom make this human support possible.  If it was not for those who participate in this effort, those who are in the same situation as Mar\u00eda would have no one to lean on.  She sends a hug to the whole team and there is no better way to say thank you than a smile from her.\r\n\r\n\u201cArc\u00e1ngel Misael\u201d is made up of a number of responsable, hard working people with great dedication to their fellow members.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAvelina operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. \r\n\r\nAside from this, she also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 16, 000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAvelina hopes to have her house renovated and dreams of being able to give her child a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":873282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

The startup program, that is joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 3000 GEL for purchasing a milk cow.  After the cow is purchased the family will start producing dairy products: cheese and yogurt for selling. They also use the milk products for family feeding. \nThis credit will be a great support for the family.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

This will be her very first loan from SMT. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Magret will expand her business by buying more goods to add to her current stock.

She will also use some of the loan for transportation and other expenses relating to her business. \r\n\r\nShe buys the ground-nuts from a make-shift business center, or \u201cluma,\u201d called Bamoi, about 160 miles round-trip from Makeni. She buys the cotton from Freetown, Sierra Leone\u2019s capital city, a 390 mile round trip from Makeni. A bag of ground-nuts costs her Le 180,000 at Bamoi, and a piece of cotton costs her Le 25,000 in Freetown.

The breads Octavia sells are made by her husband, who patiently bakes them at 3:00 in the morning to give to his wife to sell. What Octavia loves most about her work is that she can savor the bread her husband bakes and avoid hunger. She has spent 8 years doing this and longs for her own store where she can sell her bread comfortably since the most difficult part of her job is braving the intense cold in the morning, which has often made her sick. This is Octavia's second loan with MFP and she is very grateful; she used the first loan to finish building an oven. She will pay her loan back on time to avoid hurting her local bank. With this new 1500 sole loan she will buy a new cart to sell bread since her old one was stolen a few weeks ago, hurting her sales.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shanti Singh, Kiva

Se dedica a la venta de comida en un local ubicado en la avenida principal de su localidad, aunque al principio tuvo temores por su falta de experiencia en la preparaci\u00f3n de los platillos, su gran habilidad y deliciosa saz\u00f3n le facilitaron desenvolverse en su negocio. Lidia tiene un socio, con quien trabaja todos los d\u00edas desde las 11 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta la media noche, ya que las personas suelen salir con sus familias a degustar de una deliciosa cena en las avenidas principales.

This is their fourth successful year of operation! The hours of their restaurant require that they start early in the morning and work until late in the night every day of the week, oftentimes until the food runs out or the last customer is fed. They employ four people as helpers.\r\n\r\nFelex and his group members have been in business since 2006 and they are ready to expand, but their operating profit is still too low for them to make some key purchases to enable the expansion. For this reason, they are requesting their first loan from Vision Finance Company and Kiva lenders. With the loan, the group will be able to afford to buy modern cooking equipment and quality foods and supplies to satisfy their loyal customers. This effort will also help them to attract more customers as well as increase their monthly sales and profit.\r\n\r\nWith this profit, they all pledge to continue to reinvest in the business, pay school fees for their children, and build more secure futures for themselves and their families.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":430348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase modern cooking equipment and quality supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Byumba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jerome","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie Solange","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chartine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Solange","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":660000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":110000},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":110000},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":110000},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":110000},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":110000},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":110000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":110792.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110782269},{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":110792.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118169371},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":110792.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124008362},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":110792.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129037592},{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":110792.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136760261},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":110792.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022695}],"funded_date":"2009-12-16T14:45:39Z","paid_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":160423,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lucy es comerciante de todo tipo de peluches, que comercializa en la feria 16 de  julio de la ciudad de El Alto; el esposo trabaja como transportista, estas actividades son sus principales fuentes de ingreso con que cubren la manutenci\u00f3n de dos peque\u00f1os hijos que de pende de la pareja.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gravito is 46 years old and lives in the Recreo neighborhood in the city of Barranquilla.  His business is the production of snacks and pastries. \r\n\r\nHe started his career as a soccer coach, but he lost his job and needed to earn some income, so he started a bakery (just selling bread) with his savings and took a course at the Sena School to learn this trade.  This business was not going well \u2013 he has some problems with liquidity \u2013 so he sought advice from the Sena School and signed up for a class on pastries.  He has been selling pastries for 5 years, and this business now allows him to earn a living; he continues to expand his diverse product line.  At first he was very nervous, because his family doubted the success of the business, but he received a lot of support anyway.  With this business, he has been able to improve his family's quality of life.  He currently has a large, independent shop and he also caters at reception halls.\r\n\r\nWhile running this business, he also offers consulting services and technical courses on pastry-making to small businesses or entrepreneurs who would like to learn these skills.  His greatest challenge is that he does not have enough working capital to expand his operations and commercialize his products within the corporate sector.  With this goal, he is seeking a loan of  $1,000,000 (Columbian) in order to buy a larger inventory of ingredients and raw materials.   His dream is to have a gourmet-style restaurant, but still faces this great challenge of insufficient working capital to expand.  He is very happy to have been chosen to participate in the Desarrollo Productivo (DIP) program because of the quality of its loan products.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julia Kastner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":489166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy raw materials and ingredients for his pastry-making business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-02-18T22:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime Alonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":74211},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":75757},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":77335},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78946},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80591},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82270},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83984},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85733},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":87520},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":89343},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91204},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":93106}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.6},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.19},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.09},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.01},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.95},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.96,"local_amount":74211,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":75338.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949053},{"amount":39.77,"local_amount":75757,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":76908.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712217},{"amount":90.3,"local_amount":172005,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":174618.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636045},{"amount":45.04,"local_amount":85783,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":87086.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850145},{"amount":32.21,"local_amount":61354,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":62286.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550435},{"amount":181.96,"local_amount":346580,"processed_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":351846.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688045},{"amount":47.88,"local_amount":91204,"processed_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":92589.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427287},{"amount":48.88,"local_amount":93106,"processed_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":94520.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000704}],"funded_date":"2010-02-18T23:52:41Z","paid_date":"2011-03-16T08:39:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julia Kastner","image":343837}},{"id":181424,"name":"Lourdes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lourdes C. is from the village of Catarman, Camiguin Province.

She has three years of experience in this business.    Sapani needs a loan of 2,000 WST to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products to sell.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 600 WST or about $250 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nSapani joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Sapani's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

She lives in Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Nora is borrowing PHP 20,000 to purchase fish, feed for her pigs and stock for the store.  This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Nora aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.

While attending to her husband and daughter, Carolina also keeps busy with her business as her way of helping her husband with the family's daily expenses. \r\n\r\nCarolina owns a variety store. She buys groceries such as canned goods, condiments, milk, sugar and primary commodities needed in every household. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day. Her husband\u2019s income in his tricycle business is also a big help. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Carolina is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan, which she will use to buy more grocery items to increase her stock. The more items displayed at the store the better, as it helps to attract more customers to buy from her. More sales will result in better profit and will help her to save more money for her future. \r\n\r\nCarolina hopes that her business will maintain good income and become a grocery someday. It would also be a great help to have an additional tricycle.  Carolina dreams of maintaining enough income to send her daughter to a good school and for her to be able to finish college, have work and a stable life. Carolina is active in attending the weekly fellowship* as it helps to learn a lot from the Bible. Before becoming a member of CCT, Carolina never opened her Bible, but she does now as it strengthens her spiritual life.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has been able to accomplish one of her objectives by stocking up her convenience store and investing in the purchase of new clothing for resale.  Her sales have improved, as she was able to invest in a variety of products which were much needed by her influx of customers.  Her sales have become more steady and her income has improved, even in spite of the increase in prices which she is constantly facing.  However, even as the business has been going well, she can see other good changes.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a second loan to invest in clothing, as the December holidays are approaching when her sales increase significantly.  She also wants to offer a variety of products for sale in her convenience store: foods to prepare for Christmas dinner, pi\u00f1atas for the children.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She knows all the wholesale distributors and that helps her get high quality products at reasonable prices. Her good managerial skills help her be a successful salesperson. Ludmila has been a client of Nadiya Ukraine for a couple of years. She has never had a single late payment since she started using lending services. <P>\r\n\r\nLudmila needs 5000 Grivnas to re-stock her inventory. Since she does not charge high prices, she has many loyal customers who trust her and keep coming to buy yummy goodies at her kiosk. The loan will give Ludmila's business a good economic boost and will help meet the high demand for her products this season. Moreover, the loan will give Ludmila a chance to buy a new vending location which she has been planning to do for quite a while.<P>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":193747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 39 years old. Joyce is married and has three school-age children. To make a living, Joyce owns and operates a sari-sari, or general store, selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc., in the local community. Joyce has been in business for over four years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Joyce joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joyce has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. Joyce is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Joyce from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her own home with her 4 loving children and what she wishes for most is to give them a better quality of life. In the green fields of the Zona Patria town (District province of Chanchamayo), Lucia has her coffee crops.  Every morning despite weather conditions she takes care of her plants since it is the only source of income for her family.  What she enjoys most is working her land and she does it very carefully.  Lucia has 25 years of experience and considers that the most difficult part is protecting the crops from plagues since they hurt production.  In the future, she hopes to buy more land to increase production.  This is her sixth loan with MFP (Kiva\u2019s field partner) and is saving to pay her quotas on time since she does not want to cause problems to the other members of her communal bank, where she is very happy.  With the 1,500 nuevos soles, she will buy more fertilizers to protect her crops. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Duque, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":559376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertlizers to protect her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1554.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588324}],"funded_date":"2010-07-03T04:19:28Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":214325,"name":"Parveen Akhtar's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Parveen akhtar lives in the small city of Chichawatni Pakistan. \r\nShe is the mother of five children.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Ana has worked with CEPRODEL for 2 years. She feels very satisfied with the loans she has received, since they have been provided to her at the ideal moment, helping her to restock her business and satisfy her clients every day. She has a record of 10 loans.<p><p><b>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nAna Patricia C. A., es una joven casada y con 3 hijos en edad escolar.

her husband works as a driver for the municipal government of leon.  Narcisa has worked in her business for 25 years; she started with inheritance money from her deceased mother, who also worked in this activity.  Her dream is to expand and improve her working conditions, because she only works with a small sewing machine to design and create aprons, bed sets, blankets and covers, which she sells to her usual clients.
