She sells fuel (petrol and kerosene) on a retail level, taking it to sell on the banks of the river to the different crafts which need it.  She's undertaken this work for the last three years and it is going very well.  What she likes about this work is that she's familiar with many different places and talks with lots of people.

They live near the Metropolitan Football (soccer) Stadium which is home to the current Colombian champions Junior of Barranquilla. Antonio works selling sportswear, like the jerseys, shorts, accessories, hats, rattles, and flags of all of the teams, but especially Junior, which has many supporters who always buy gear win or lose. They buy accessories to add to their outfit, and buy more during important parts of the season. \r\n\r\nHe began this job in 2003 as a family business after working for a small business making ceramic souvenirs for special events, but Antonio wanted to earn more money. He started this job because he really enjoys it, has created two jobs, and he works a from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM. He says that even though there is a lot of competition, the setting awakens the passion of the people on the coast and the market is large enough to provide sales for all the vendors. This is why many of the competitors in this business are friends and good companions to work with. He resupplies his business every two days and he needs capital to maintain his business funds and continue to update and modernize the merchandise he sells.

He has space at a market area near the center of city where he sells a variety of men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing. Daler has been in business for about eight years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She remembers that 7 years ago she had a store where she sold a little of everything; unfortunately she closed it for health reasons, as she wasn't able to give it the full attention and energy that it required.  After some time her health improved, and since she had leftover bottles of sodas she began to sell them again, but now she only sells drinks.  Currently her business is in her home where she re-purposed an area to attend to the customers.  She wants to use her loan to buy drinks.  The business that she hopes to have in the future is selling clothes.  She wants to find a place in a commercial zone where she can put a clothes bazaar.  She hopes to achieve this very soon.  On the other hand, as president of the group \"Unidas para alcanzar el exito\" (united to reach success) she is learning a lot.  There are 7 members that make up the group, and they are all very punctual in their payments.\r\n\r\n*Natalia is dressed in the yellow shirt.

His mixed farm produces tea, which he sells through Kenya Tea Development Authority and beans, onions and milk, which are sold to the local market. He also relies on his pension pay to cater to the basic needs of his family. \r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan of 45,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

She has 5 children who now support themselves. She has her own home, equipped with basic services. She sells corn once it has been processed and also has a car that she uses to transport people. This gives her income during the week. On the weekend she sells food. She has 12 years of experience in these areas, and they have been a good source of income for her single family. There is a lot of competition in the activities she is involved in, but thanks to her experience she has been able to capture a lot of the market and therefore has high demand. This credit will be used to repair her car, because it was in an accident. Since the car is a principal source of income for Margarita, it is important that she repair it. Margarita has had 8 loans with excellent payment history.

Both her children go to school. She resides and rents a one room house where she is staying with three people. Marjorie doesn\u2019t take care of additional family members.  The family has access to electricity and gets three meals a day but has no piped water.\n\n[She incurs   transport costs to and from buying baking materials from Kalerwe market   .]  She works in a semi-urban area which is in the outskirts of Kampala. She owns a stall in Kyebando selling snacks in the market. Marjorie sells all types of snacks ranging from samosas, mandazi chapatti, pan cakes and kebabs.  She works seven days a week and averages 35 customers a day. Her major business challenges include ever increasing prices of cooking oil, wheat and baking flour and the rainy season which disturbs her work because she works in an open place. Her monthly expenses include rent for her residence, monthly market dues, feeding the family and medications. Besides this frying business she also operates a pre-primary school near her home.

Her home is made of cement and has basic services like running water and electricity although the streets are still unpaved.  She is a single mother of two daughters; a 20-year-old university student, and a 13-year-old who is in private school.  About five years ago she began to buy fingernail polish and hair bands.  She would sell them from her house and began to make enough money to set up a store where she sells stuffed toys, greeting cards, make-up, stationery, etc.  Narcisa works from 7:30am until 9pm.  One of her greatest difficulties is having to go to Guayaquil to buy her merchandise.  With the financing she wants to buy more stuffed toys, greeting cards, and  underwear to enlarge her store.  In the future she wants to set up a second store that her 20-year-old daughter can run.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":456201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Stuffed toys, underwear, make-up.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2009-12-23T23:40:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narcisa Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":68.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":71.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":74.78},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75.31},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":79.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":88.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.12},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.28},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.12,"local_amount":68.12,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":68.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074083},{"amount":71.58,"local_amount":71.58,"processed_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":71.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910051},{"amount":74.78,"local_amount":74.78,"processed_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":74.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945616},{"amount":75.31,"local_amount":75.31,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":75.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673979},{"amount":77.56,"local_amount":77.56,"processed_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":77.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708140},{"amount":79.2,"local_amount":79.2,"processed_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":79.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891343},{"amount":81.42,"local_amount":81.42,"processed_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":81.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631611},{"amount":83.28,"local_amount":83.28,"processed_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845506},{"amount":88.75,"local_amount":88.75,"processed_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":88.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172111801}],"funded_date":"2009-12-25T14:45:24Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":169107,"name":"Lem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lem H., 30, is married and lives with her only child in Dangkao, Cambodia.

She has been selling cosmetics through her direct-selling line of the popular cosmetics brands.\r\n\r\nMary Ann has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings* and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow five times in CCT\u2019s cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her direct-selling business.\r\n\r\nNow, with your help, Mary Ann would like to obtain a PHP 10,000 loan.

Her dream of having her own business came true when she received loans after joining ASHI.\r\n\r\nAt first, Lulu had a small \u201csari-sari\u201d store. Sari-sari means a store attached to a house where various kinds of foodstuff, beverages and other basic commodities are sold. A lot of people from the village are customers of this kind of store because this is the most convenient way they can access things they need every day without spending on transportation costs. Lulu and her family enjoyed the small proceeds her business brought them. \r\n\r\nEventually, through her successive loans from ASHI, Lulu was able to purchase a \u201cpedicab\u201d (a bicycle with sidecar) for a transportation business managed by her husband. Lulu and her husband have four children to support and so they both have to work hard and earn through their own business. Lulu\u2019s youngest child is two years old and the eldest is 26. Her oldest and her second oldest child, who is 24, are both working as computer programmers for small private shops in town. Both are not earning well, and so Lulu still supports some of their needs as well as the needs of her three other children. \r\n\r\nBecause Lulu\u2019s husband\u2019s pedicab is operated using a bicycle, he earns only a small income by the end of each day of hard work. Lulu is requesting a loan through ASHI to purchase a motorcycle to replace her husband\u2019s bicycle. With this, his income will grow and he will be able to support the improvement of their standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":535096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Alice is a hard-grinding business lady. The 50-year-old married mother of five school-going children sweats her guts out buying and selling animals like cows as well as selling milk from the cows and selling matooke (green plantain) from her plantation.

M. lives in San Jacinto Bolivar, a town where artisan tradition is the favorite activity of the population as it is handed down from generation to generation.  It is normal to go into any home in this town in the department of Bolivar and find a vertical loom with woven fabric being made for the beautiful hammocks, knapsacks and other beautiful crafts produced here. \r\n\r\nThis is precisely what Gelen does.  She is 28 years old and lives with her husband and 4-year old son.  Honoring tradition she weaves fabric as a source of income but also sells fast food.  This is her third loan through the Mario Santo Domingo foundation and her first through Kiva.  She plans to use it to buy raw materials to make hammocks.  She believes it will be a sound investment since she already has orders for the rest of the year.  She also plans to buy ingredients for her fast food products.  She will get a good discount since she plans to buy wholesale quantities, bringing down her production costs, increasing her competitiveness and allowing her to pass on savings by lowering the sale price. \r\n\r\nGelen has always enjoyed being a merchant.  She used to sell beauty products through specialized magazines.  With that experience she was able to develop her entrepreneurial skills such as those used in her current fast food business, which she runs every evening, and her craft selling business which she runs together with a friend she has in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, and in the seaside city of Santa Marta.\r\n\r\nThe fast food activity was begun because there was nothing similar in this busy area.  Regarding the craft business, she started out when friends and family began ordering her products.  She was able to earn a little capital which she reinvested.  Her dream and goal is to have a large company through her hard work so she can provide a good future for her son and expand her home to have a large space out of which to work.  Her short-term plans are to make some home improvements.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling food products in the local community. Gemma has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Gemma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gemma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Gemma is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional canned goods, coffee, sugar, rice and bread to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Gemma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

His goal for later on is to complete his Internet caf\u00e9 to earn income to support his youngest daughter\u2019s university studies.\r\n\r\nAt present, Wilson finds himself applying for a Kiva loan to buy a computer, to stock the cooler with soft-drinks and beverages and to buy reams of paper and ink for his transcriptions business'  use.  With this he is sure of a successful investment because he was running short on services and his customers were looking for other alternatives.  This way, they\u2019ll be satisfied with the really cold beverages they\u2019ll find in the intense heat and high ambient temperatures typical of the town of Malambo thanks to the new investment in Wilson\u2019s refrigerator.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":864463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock his cooler with soft-drinks and beverages, to buy a computer and to buy reams of paper and ink for his transcriptions business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":67728},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":74753},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":76497},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":78282},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80109},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":81978},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83891},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85848},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87851},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89901},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91999},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":101163}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.94},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.99},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.98},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.01},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.07},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.69},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.94,"local_amount":67728,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":69397.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614945},{"amount":42.99,"local_amount":74753,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-26T08:50:09Z","rounded_local_amount":76595.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568887},{"amount":43.74,"local_amount":76070,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":77945.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188605},{"amount":91.32,"local_amount":158818,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":162732.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324817},{"amount":47.13,"local_amount":81978,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:32:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83998.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038872},{"amount":48.24,"local_amount":83891,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":85958.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651029},{"amount":49.36,"local_amount":85848,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":87964.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140637},{"amount":102.21,"local_amount":177752,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":182133.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338171},{"amount":111.07,"local_amount":193162,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":197923.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301394765}],"funded_date":"2011-10-08T04:53:26Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":337696,"name":"Nelsa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Nelsa, 48, a resident of Baseco, Manila, Philippines.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages in small quantities to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Aside from this she also earns additional income from rugs and accessories that she sells. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nNelsa hopes to be able to expand soon, and she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Her husband is trying to build her a store on the small lot on which they live.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":276504,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"The loan was used to buy maca [an Andean root vegetable] for her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-02-23T02:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":160,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.32,"local_amount":95.38,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:17Z","rounded_local_amount":104.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084922},{"amount":70.68,"local_amount":64.62,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-21T07:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":70.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439290}],"funded_date":"2009-02-23T02:13:20Z","paid_date":"2009-06-21T07:42:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":95098,"name":"Rosemary Janet Awuor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosemary Janet Awuor is a 32-year-old mother of three children aged 16, 7 and 3.

Its membership includes 15 women, all of them adults and residents of the same neighborhood.\r\n<p>\r\nRight now the committee works in 10-month cycles, receiving an average of 540,000 for each member. These recipients use their loans for the economic activities detailed below, of which you will see the majority are street vendors that sell various products.\r\n<p>\r\nIt should be mentioned that as well as the financial assistance that these women receive, they also benefit from non-financial services such as training each cycle, in which they learn to maintain the integrity of the committee, to save and to carry out their personal and family budgets. This encapsulates all the benefits that they receive from the program Comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendedoras (Enterprising Women\u2019s Committee) that promotes the foundation Paraguaya de Cooperaci\u00f3n y Desarollo (Cooperation and Development of Paraguay). \r\n<p>\r\nThe members of the Committee thank the foundation Paraguaya for bringing them these types of opportunities that promote the creation of small businesses and generate economic resources for sectors that are not favored for this type of benefits. \r\n<p>\r\n1.\tFrancisca C.

es una mujer de 36 a\u00f1os, su af\u00e1n de progreso la llevaron a potenciar sus capacidades comerciales en beneficio de su familia, pues sus hijos son su mayor motivador. Elegir la venta de productos naturales ha sido una de las mejores decisiones que tom\u00f3, ya que  estos productos son muy solicitados debido a sus propiedades curativas, por lo que es un negocio muy rentable. Para obtener mayores pedidos, Julia sale a ofrecer sus productos de casa en casa a sus clientes, siendo largas horas de caminata pues recorre varios lugares de su ciudad, regresando a altas horas de la noche a su casa. Por ello, para evitar estas caminatas, Julio desea invertir en la instalaci\u00f3n de una tienda naturista en su casa, ya que la empresa con la que trabaja le puede brindar facilidades de pago para obtener grandes cantidades de productos y espera aprovechar esta oportunidad. Este es su octavo cr\u00e9dito con Microfinanzas PRISMA, en su banco comunal, lo que m\u00e1s le agrada es el esfuerzo que cada miembro realiza para el progreso de su grupo. Con los 2000 soles que ahora solicita incrementar\u00e1 su capital de trabajo para obtener mayor cantidad de productos.","en":"Julia is a 36 year-old woman.  Her family\u2019s welfare drives her to maximize her business capacity.  Her children are her primary motivation. Her choice to sell natural products has been one of the best decisions that she has made. These products are very much in demand because of their curative properties. It is a profitable business. To obtain the most requests for her products, Julia sells them door to door to her customers. She works long hours selling her products in various neighborhoods in the city. She returns to her house late at night. In order to stop working such late hours, Julia would like to install a permanent natural products store at her house. In this way she can buy a larger quantity of products from the company that she represents. This is her eighth loan with PRISMA Microfinance, a cooperative bank. She is most thankful for the effort that each member makes towards the progress of the group.

Six years ago, she started a small grocery store out of her home.  During this time, her business became well-known and favorite establishment in her town because of the friendly attention she gives to her customers.  Lately, her customers have been buying on credit and paying at the end of the month because of financial difficulties.  Meanwhile her shelves remain empty.  Her partner works in the early morning hours on a farm, but his salary is not enough to cover their expenses.  In order to restock her store and keep it attractive, Olinda prepares food on the weekends and sells it from her house in order to generate more income.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her third loan from MFP.  Olinda repaid her previous loans responsibly and she is very comfortable with her Communal Bank and her role as the group secretary.

For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He will also use a portion of this loan to increase his working capital. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":584484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more dairy products to sell to his customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Chingeltei, Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"46 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":116,"posted_date":"2010-08-17T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Batbaatar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":160.21,"local_amount":210800,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":212275.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172194303},{"amount":158.46,"local_amount":208505.2,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":209964.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177489981},{"amount":158.35,"local_amount":208349.03,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T16:01:41Z","rounded_local_amount":209807.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182626313},{"amount":156.88,"local_amount":206425.43,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T15:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":207870.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188764231},{"amount":158.57,"local_amount":208647.51,"processed_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T01:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":210108.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191613072},{"amount":157.6,"local_amount":207365.94,"processed_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:11:56Z","rounded_local_amount":208817.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196057253},{"amount":401.28,"local_amount":528006.57,"processed_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":531702.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201495475},{"amount":548.65,"local_amount":721900.32,"processed_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-21T07:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":726953.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206930336}],"funded_date":"2010-08-17T10:21:15Z","paid_date":"2011-05-21T07:55:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":227053,"name":"Mame Marie Fall","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Mame Marie Fall B. est une femme de 46 ans qui habite a la cite Ousmane Fall dans la localit\u00e9 de Dalifort.

Her goal going forward is to set up in an air-conditioned space and offer, in addition to internet service, ice cream and sweets, and use that additional income to improve her family's well-being and make everyone in her home very happy.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":699901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a computer to expand her internet business, and restock her snack stand","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-01-25T18:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Levis Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":72354},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":76296},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":77758},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":79249},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80768},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82316},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83894},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":85502},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87140},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":88810},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":90513},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":95400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.79},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.76},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.59},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.42},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.28},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.14},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.03},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.85},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.78},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.79,"local_amount":72354,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-18T09:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":73361.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427785},{"amount":41.97,"local_amount":76296,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":77358.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289234},{"amount":42.76,"local_amount":77758,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":78840.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157372},{"amount":43.59,"local_amount":79249,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":80352.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230382},{"amount":44.42,"local_amount":80768,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":81892.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673467},{"amount":91.42,"local_amount":166210,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":168524.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320023},{"amount":246.05,"local_amount":447365,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":453594.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803166}],"funded_date":"2011-01-25T20:36:36Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":272130,"name":"Enh-Amgalan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Enh-Amgalan, 53, is married and lives with his wife and a daughter in the Songinohairhan district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia.

With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Thelma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to purchase scrap metal and plastic so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs.

Mrs Rim C. is a farmer who owns a small piece of land to cultivate rice, and she needs fertilizer to make her crop more productive. \r\n<p>\r\nEighteen members in this group have end-of-term (EoT) loans. This means they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. (The rest have monthly payment loans.) EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. An EoT loan allows the borrower to repay portions of the principal whenever he or she is financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

For five years Afiavi has lived in the Akpakpa Sodj\u00e9atinm\u00e8 neighborhood of Cotonou, economical capital of Benin.  Afiavi helps her husband in the family expenses.  As to school, Afiavi herself quit school at the primary level.  For 11 years she has been a dressmaker who also sells fabrics for curtains and sheets from her residence and through a distribution system.  Afiavi purchases her supplies in Lom\u00e9, the capital of Togo.  Afiavi has never obtained a loan from ALID\u00e9 before.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have four children between the ages of 29 and 34.  His business is located to the south of the city, where he upholsters and paints household furniture.  Wilfrido started this business in 1991 and has 20 years of work experience.  He operates his small business in the front part of his home.  In his business, Wilfrido provides a term of seven days in which he will work before anticipating payment.  The competition is fierce, so he must maintain his quality and complete his work in a timely fashion.  He purchases his materials with cash from several suppliers in the central part of town.  Wilfredo does upholstery work on chairs, living room sets, dining room sets, and automobiles.  His goal later on is to replace his upholstery equipment and to acquire his own home.  The greatest challenge he faces is not having enough capital to rapidly achieve his growth targets.  He also wants to make use of his living space so that he can develop his products and have some peace-of-mind.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn the meantime, Wilfredo works so that he can reach his goals.  He manages a current ratio of 2.96 and a profitability rate from his sales of no less than 39.77%.  These indicators predict his growth potential and a successful investment from his Kiva loan, which is his first form of financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

Nicholas, 38 years old, is the married father of three children. All his children are in school and he is also taking care of two orphans.\r\n\r\nNicholas runs a crafts shop business in Rwamunyari, Ibanda district. He has been plying his business for the last seven years and it is with these profits that he has managed to shoulder his family responsibilities.\r\n\r\nNicholas\u2019s major drawback over the years has been clients who take most of his items on credit.

She has been knitting her whole life and does it mostly during the early mornings, when she concentrates on making her stitches and lets her imagination help her make the most beautiful designs and forms. After a painstaking review by the company that purchases her merchandise, Rosa has been recognized for the hue and quality of her items. The chair covered with blankets in the photo is where Rosa knits nonstop. She enjoys her work, although lately she has had some problems with her eye sight, which is why in the future she plans to renew her business of selling nutritional products, which she had done to earn additional income. This is her ninth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she promises to make her payments on time. She knows and values the benefits of these loans, and she enjoys working with her fellow members of her community bank. With the loan she is requesting, Rosa plans to purchase nutritional products at wholesale so she can expand her business and capture more revenue, but without giving up her knitting business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":560099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"Purchase nutritional products to earn additional income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":214.3},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":221.21},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":231.51},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":244.31},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":255.31},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":265.53},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":278.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":289.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.68},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.19},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.92},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.57},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.68,"local_amount":214.3,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":219.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673495},{"amount":116,"local_amount":320,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":328.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887314},{"amount":91.93,"local_amount":253.59,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:27Z","rounded_local_amount":260.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154325},{"amount":44.75,"local_amount":123.44,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":126.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449623},{"amount":92.55,"local_amount":255.31,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":261.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588332},{"amount":96.25,"local_amount":265.53,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":272.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724824},{"amount":101.05,"local_amount":278.75,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":285.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463011},{"amount":104.79,"local_amount":289.08,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:04Z","rounded_local_amount":296.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886523}],"funded_date":"2010-07-01T19:16:46Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":214793,"name":"Lona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lona P. is in the business of selling bread, tomatoes and cooking oil at the market and is requesting a loan so as to stock dried fish to sell.\r\n\r\nLona is a woman whose husband died a long time ago and she has four children who all attend school.

Christine, 28, earns her living waiting for travelers to buy bottled fruit juices and chicken from her stand. It is not always a rosy picture! One has to have reserves of resilience to succeed in this business. Anyone who has traversed the Kampala-Jinja highway will bear witness to the stiff competition that exists at this popular stop-over for refreshments.

In this way, he harvests his crops quickly and sells them to traders who pay him very well for each kilogram of produce that he sells.\r\n\r\nElver considers that the most difficult part of his work is transporting his products from the farm to the town of San Francisco which is where they offer him the best prices for his cacao beans, coffee and coca leaf.

Pablita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. \r\n\r\nPablita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional green bananas and coconuts for copras. This will be the third loan taken out by Pablita from HSPFI.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":288046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

Since being married, she has put into practice the skills that she learned as a child thanks to her mother who taught her various sewing skills.  Consuelo married someone that worked making clothing, and as a result increased her knowledge.  They now work hard together, attending the requests that their customers give them, whether they are individuals or institutions.  They have been doing this for 5 years in the workshop that they set up in their house, where she creates the designs for the various garments and later her husband takes them to the central market where the majority of their clients are located.\r\n\r\nConsuelo is planning to put new machinery in their workshop to improve the quality of their garment and with time, to have their own exclusive brand which is distinguished by their designs.
