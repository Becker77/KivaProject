Her house is made of cement and she has all the basics; her husband has a stand where he sells gas cilinders and they are expecting their first child. \r\n\r\nErika started her business as a makeup artist by visiting her clients in their homes, and soon she had enough clients to open her own beauty salon. She now works every day from 12pm until 10pm, giving haircuts, dying and styling hair.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan.

After getting her degree in food services from a junior college, Zamira worked for five years at a wine and spirits distillery located in the town of Karabalta. This is where she met the man who would later become her husband. She got married in 1991. Now Zamira is the mother of three sons; the eldest son, Erkin, is her main helper in everything, and the younger sons are in schools. Five years ago, searching for a source of income for her family, Zamira launched her own business, opening a small grocery store named \u201cBek,\u201d which is located in the central part of the village of Belovodskoe. After overcoming many challenges, Zamira was able to grow her business, which now brings a monthly income of 20,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Zamira was able to  purchase a car for her family. In order to grow her business further, Zamira turned to \u201cBai Tushum and Partners\u201d for a loan in the amount of 100,000 in order to increase her sales volume and install new display cases.

She is married with three children and lives in the town of Mlolongo that sits along the Mombasa -Nairobi highway.\r\n\r\nSera graduated from one of the largest referral hospitals in East Africa, Kenyatta Medical Training Center, in 1999 and started operating her clinic and pharmacy shop in 2006.  She began the clinic with initial capital from savings she made while employed at the Kenyatta National Hospital as a doctor (USD $1470). \r\n\r\nEquipped with her savings and her technical skills, Sera approached her husband, who is also a qualified doctor, and together they started the clinic and pharmacy shop.  They decided to start their business in Mlolongo because it is a very fast-growing town.  The couple rented two houses to host the clinic and hospital.  The business continues to grow as many patients seek their services.  The town is located along the only highway connecting Mombasa and Nairobi where many medical emergencies occur.  Also, Sera is able to perform labor deliveries, sending any complicated cases to Kenyatta Hospital in Nairobi.\r\n\r\nThe clinic and pharmacy have saved so many lives that Sera cannot recall the number and she wants to continue with this trend for many years to come.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

C. is 53 years old, married, and has eight children between the ages of 10 and 32, four of whom attend school. Yunes lives in Litein town in Rift Valley Kenya and is a dairy farmer. She has been in the farming business for 15 years and employs one farmhand. She sells her milk to the local tea estate through Kenya Tea Development Authority. \r\n\r\nYunes is requesting for a loan of 40,000 KES through Kiva partner Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a dairy cow.

She owns & operates a business venture planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has 3 years of experience in this business. She needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the profits from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Maikeronisia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Maikeronisia's 5th loan with SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":248614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Marifat is 51 year-old woman, married and has two children.  She has one daughter and an older son, who is now in Russia for work.  Her husband does not work because he is a disabled person of a second group, and takes care of men's home work.  Their son helps the parents by sending money home.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She and her husband are working hard to get ahead, and in the future she wants to refurbish her business premises to give her shop a good reputation, so it is competitive and stands out in the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":215127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of pigs, steers and chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Bellavista - San Martin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-7.066667 -76.533333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-25T07:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-08T11:01:10Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951459},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224486},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417209},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27110807},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006201},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":177.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590136}],"funded_date":"2008-10-25T10:01:10Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:41:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":74310,"name":"Giuliana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Giuliana tiene 20 a\u00f1os, es soltera y vive en casa de sus padres.

She was a quick learner and found that the work really suited her, so she decided to start her own business manufacturing ropes and now sells them wholesale in various cities. Because her ropes are of higher quality, she has noticed an increase in sales, and, with her children's help, she is able to produce rope in greater quantities.

She is helpful and shares with other Finca members when they are in need.  \r\n\r\nFelicita's dream is to have another beauty shop in a more commercial area.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":316230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Felicita necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1000 soles para la compra de una vitrina, y de materiales para peluquer\u00eda, l\u00edquidos, tintes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-05-10T22:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":259.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44443609},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T01:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":259.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52953948},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":259.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63171161},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":259.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73596502}],"funded_date":"2009-05-11T02:13:44Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T14:55:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Hubman","image":226625}},{"id":111174,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"I am lucky and blessed that I have a husband who is responsible and always looks out for the best for our children.

She says demand for food is on the high side but she does not have adequate funds for expansion. She has been in food production for ten years now. Her proceeds are used to cover her children's school bills. \r\n<p>\r\nAugustina is a 36-year-old woman. She is married with four children who are currently in school.

Yolanda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Yolanda is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings.  5000 PHP is enough to purchase the additional products she wants, and that is why she chose that amount. This will be her fifth loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":365382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Faalolo has 4 years of experience in this business.  Faalolo needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Faalolo joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faalolo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faalolo A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She buys her products in Dantokpa, Benin\u2019s international market, and also in Lom\u00e9, Togo.\r\n\r\nHonorine has already been granted one loan from ALID\u00e9, which was repaid in full. She is considering the increase of her stock supply in response to strong customer demand. She is therefore requesting a second laon from ALID\u00e9 to reinforce her working capital. Honorine\u2019s ambition for the future is to open a shop where she can display and sell her fabrics.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":516342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy 13 pieces of fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-03-29T18:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Honorine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":190000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":19000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":19539.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653396},{"amount":40,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:32:05Z","rounded_local_amount":19539.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835603},{"amount":40,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":19539.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159576000},{"amount":40,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":19539.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954514},{"amount":40,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":19539.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056171},{"amount":80,"local_amount":38000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-27T10:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":39079.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347706},{"amount":40,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-20T10:23:32Z","rounded_local_amount":19539.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482762},{"amount":15.16,"local_amount":7200,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":7404.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617572},{"amount":24.84,"local_amount":11800,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":12135.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191360979},{"amount":40,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":19539.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779676}],"funded_date":"2010-04-01T03:30:39Z","paid_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":193969,"name":"Massajja A Wakawesa Margaret Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"W.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She lives with her parents and her two young children.  Two years ago, she started a business raising sheep, a business that has helped her increase her earnings because the market pays a premium for lamb.  She also has a few cows that produce milk, another product that sells well in the markets in and around the city, but a business that requires her to start very early in the morning because she has to collect the milk and sell it to her customers while it's fresh for their morning breakfasts.  This is Zelmira's 13th MFP loan and she's repaid all of her past loans.  She's a star among the members of her community bank.  The loan will be used to buy sheep which cost around 300 soles per head.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

Panaogao Marland, Brgy IV, Silay City, Negros Occidental. Her husband Anselmo works as a laborer in Hacienda on a sugar-cane plantation.  He earns a minimum salary that depends on the time of year:  during sugar milling season, he works six days a week, but during the off-season he works only three to four days a week. The couple is blessed with four children, ages 21 to 27. They work and contribute to help support the household. Melanie dreams of improving their living, fixing their house, buying productive assets and saving enough to support herself and her husband when they grow old.\r\n\r\nShe knew that all these dreams would be for naught if she stayed at home and just waited for her husband to hand her his meager salary. She saved enough from her husband's salary to start a small general store selling only the most in-demand household commodities. When she realized that she needed additional capital to sustain her growing business, it was timely that she heard about the microcredit services of NWTF-Project Dungganon. She became a member in 2004 and from that point on, she never looked back but continued to expand and diversify her business activities. Today, in addition to her general store, she has a rice retailing business where most of her customers are the laborers who work on the sugar-cane plantation where they live. They get the rice on credit for their daily needs and pay back at the end of the week when they receive their salary. She has also put up a barbecue stand. She earns a cumulative net profit of PHP 4,400 per month.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 9,500 was used as additional working capital for her businesses. The loan was fully repaid without delay. Now she is borrowing PHP 19,500 to be used in her general store and for her rice retailing business. She needs this higher capital because sugar milling season has already started and she anticipates a higher demand for all her goods.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent arable land. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The representative of the group, named Brigitte, is the one whose hand is raised in the photo.\r\n\r\nBrigitte is 37 years old and is married to a teacher named Florent. The couple has five children, of whom three are dependents. All attend (or have attended) school. Brigitte has not attended school herself.\r\n\r\nFor the past fifteen years, Brigitte has been selling throughout her region the charcoal and palm oil she produces.

Ms Le Thi V. puts a lot of efforts to raise all four children. When V. was 43 years old and her first child attended college, her family was in a great need.  With the encouragement of her husband, a retired officer, Ms. V. applied for a 125USD loan from TYM Fund to open a shop selling tea, sundry goods and clothes.  Her monthly income has increased constantly in the past 11 years.  Although all her children are now grown up, and her family has become pretty stable, she has never thought of leaving TYM Fund.  After more than 10 years, V. has considered TYM Fund her second family.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

A. lives in the town of Nurek. She has 4 children. Since her children are still very young, she is the single provider for the family.  She has been in the business of cattle farming for the last 25 years. She purchases skinny animals, feeds them for a number of days, and sells them later on. This process is continuous and it brings her profits, which are sufficient for food only.

She gets supplies once a month from farmers in the surrounding villages of S\u00e9lingu\u00e9.  Once the peanuts are sorted, they are dried, roasted, and winnowed. Then they are taken to the mill for making the peanut butter (a very popular condiment among the staple foods of Mali) and for packing it into tubs to be sold wholesale. \r\n<p>\r\nShe hopes to

(pig-raising) business, aside from helping her husband in the farm as a farmer as well. It has been five years now that Catalina and her husband have been able to have a rice-farming business. This has been a great source of income for the couple so they are able to send their only child to college until graduation. <P>\r\n\r\nCatalina's loan from ASHI when she joined in 2008 was used to finance this business instead of borrowing money from other people in their neighborhood which requires bigger interest rates per month. This was what they had been doing in the past when Catalina was not yet a member of ASHI and had no access to loans. Profit then was not really big and growing a business was very hard. <P>\r\n\r\nNow that Catalina has fully paid her first loan, she is requesting a much bigger loan to be able to accelerate the quality of rice they are producing for a better price and profit. Since Catalina is still using rice land which she doesn't own, every harvest they are required to give the owner of the land a share of the rice depending how many sacks they have agreed on for every acre. Someday, through her profit and helped by loans from ASHI, Catalina wished to purchase her own rice land.

They have four children who no longer live with them since they have moved to the capital in search of a better future and a good education.  Ninda and her husband live in their own home.\r\n<p>\r\nShe works every day selling food, basic necessities, and toiletries.  At the same time, for the past 15 years, Ninda has been growing bananas, avocados, and citrus fruits native to the Peruvian jungle.  She manages her businesses by herself and enjoys her work.  Ninda is already accustomed to waking up early so that she can tend to her beloved husband and the early-rising customers who come to her general store to buy bread, milk, and chocolate for breakfast. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the evenings, she takes a rest.  Since there are no stores that are open late, she has neighbors who come by to her establishment when it is closed and knock on her door requesting to be served.  \u201cIt does not bother me because the poor have no other place to shop,\u201d says Ninda.  She considers her business to be very profitable and emphasizes that her earnings have enabled her to educate her children and cover the household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nAs an entrepreneur, she has plans to open another grocery store or hardware store across from her home.  In addition, she wants to finish construction of the second floor of her house and turn it into a tourist lodge.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.

He, his wife Ana, 22, and their little daughter, live in his parents' house. She works in a factory.   Since he was 10 years old, this hardworking man has dedicated himself to the transport business.  At the moment, he works as a conductor  on one of the area's public transport lines.  He is very happy with his work, since he receives a regular income, which allows him to offer his family an adequate quality of life.  He enjoys taking payment from his regular customers, although he doesn't like it when people don't want to pay the actual price and cause trouble.  He works four days a week from 5 am to 9 pm and rests on the weekends.  In the future, he hopes to turn himself into a driver, since he knows how to drive and wants to increase his income. He also wants to install a grocery story in his home, and for this reason, he has begun to prepare a space for this shop.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with microfinance partner MFP, and he promises to pay his installments promptly.  The loan will allow him to keep working to better his conditions.  Nelson plans to invest the funds in restoring part of his house.  He needs to change the roof, which already has some holes in it, and thereby start preparing his home for his grocery store business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":628106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To restore the roof of his house and to install a shop in it.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:06Z","rounded_local_amount":139.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588806},{"amount":50,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":139.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725303},{"amount":100,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":278.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886785}],"funded_date":"2010-11-01T11:36:17Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ross Forman","image":1172721}},{"id":247271,"name":"Ly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The young woman in the photograph is Ly S., age 31, who lives in the province of Kompong Cham, the best territory for farming. \r\n\r\nLy S. is a married woman who is devoted to her three young children, who attend school and depend on her care.

She is 59 years old, married and has five adult children. To make a living, Perla owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling canned goods, snack foods, and beverages in the local community. Perla has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Perla joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perla has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. Perla is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods and beverages. This loan will be Perla's fourth loan from HSPFI.

She will use the 3000 new soles to buy more medicine to stock her drug store.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":822633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to buy medicine to stock her pharmacy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-25T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":203.42},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":210.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":221.48},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":226.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":237.15},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":240.94},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":253.89},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":264.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":269.32},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":282.49},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":290.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":299.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.21},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.02},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.1},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.57},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.59,"local_amount":203.42,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":204.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350791},{"amount":77.28,"local_amount":210.78,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:12Z","rounded_local_amount":211.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851153},{"amount":81.21,"local_amount":221.48,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":222.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666329},{"amount":83.02,"local_amount":226.42,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":227.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621486},{"amount":86.96,"local_amount":237.15,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":237.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835559},{"amount":88.34,"local_amount":240.94,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":241.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245319},{"amount":608.6,"local_amount":1659.81,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1665.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098549}],"funded_date":"2011-07-25T23:25:31Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":325131,"name":"Catherine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Catherine is a 37-year-old rice-growing farmer, she is a widow with three children.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her to continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

members of the group \"Benkadi 3\" are married women averaging 30 years of age and four children each all living in traditional families in Bougoura, a village in San (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali). The women are collaborating with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso to carry out their farm work during the wet season. They are on their fifth loan with the institution. The past loans have indeed been paid back. \r\n\r\nThe crops grown are rice and peanuts, as is the case with NANA, the first one seated from the right in the photo.

This is Polly. He is the Deputy Head Teacher of Ryakasinga CHE School, a mixed school in the Rural area of Kabwohe in Sheema with 800 students. Ryakasinga CHE School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nRyakasinga CHE School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Polly ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2050863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Sheema","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ryakasinga Che School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3817300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2018-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":477166}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":605,"name":"Emilly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">K. is married with 2 children and she is 26 years old.

With this goal in mind, they decided two years ago to start raising guinea pigs. In earlier years they had practiced agriculture, but due to the physical effort involved and for health reasons, they had to give it up and sell all their plots of land, so that they could devote themselves entirely to this new business venture. \r\n<p>\r\nDay by day they wait for their guinea pigs to grow, watching the fruits of their investment with satisfaction. In order to house the new members of this small business, they plan to improve the facilities of their farm and become better prepared in order to obtain better results.

She is married and has three children. For 11 years, she has worked as an operator for the \u201cTojiktelecom\u201d company in Vakhdat city. She works from morning to night for a small salary which she uses to feed her family. Her husband takes on odd-jobs also bringing home a small salary.

Nkwaateng is in the Eastern Region of Ghana. A sizeable number of the inhabitants are engaged in farming activities. However, quite a large number of women are involved in palm oil production. Augustina is one of the women who actively produce palm oil. She has been in business for six years. \r\n\r\nShe buys the palm nuts from the local farmers in her community; processes it in her house to produce the oil and sells at wholesale prices to her customers. Palm oil is a local vegetable oil produced from the food of the palm fruits. It has been cooked, pounded, sieved and boiled for hours. The reddish substance (the oil) is skimmed off and boiled again to expel water content. Augustina wants to use the loan to expand her business by buying the palm fruits in bulk. She will then be able to increase the number of customers she serves.  She owns a refrigerator and uses it for the sale of sachet water to support her family with additional income.\r\n\r\nShe believes the loan assistance would enable her to scale up production to serve a larger market and, eventually, help improve her family finances. She is a member of a Trust Bank group called Kingdom Trust Group.
