He and his wife have two school-age children. To earn a living, Roger owns and operates a business venture in the transportation services sector. Specifically, his primary source of income is derived from operating a motor-transport service. Roger has been engaged in his business for over four years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Roger joined GDMPC to gain much-needed access to financial services. In turn, he was better able to engage in business activities and to thereby improve his family's standard of living. Recently, Roger successfully repaid a previous loan in the amount of 15,000 PHP from GDMPC.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She was selling candies in the Central Market in Lima for a while until she decided to become independent.  She decided to open up a candy store alone, becoming an unofficial distributor of many candy companies.  When she had enough money saved up, she opened up a small store in her home, 18 years ago.  Bit by bit, thanks to her and her husband\u2019s efforts, she has been able to sign an agreement with a big candy company so that she is an exclusive distributor of their brand of candy and snacks.  Now she has been working for them for 15 years and the business keeps growing.\r\n<p>\r\nIsabel and her husbad have 2 kids who are 19 and 12 years old.  They both work hard to keep progressing and find new markets in which to sell their products.  The shop that they have is a sign of the great effort that they have put in since they decided to start this business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer <b\/.> <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nPara Isabel todo empez\u00f3 cuando aun era muy joven. Estuvo vendiendo dulces al por mayor en el mercado central de Lima durante una temporada hasta que decidi\u00f3 independizarse. Sola se animo a ofrecer de bodega en bodega golosinas, cumpliendo el papel de distribuidora no oficial de las empresas de golosinas. Una vez que tuvo ahorrado un dinero abri\u00f3 una tienda de dulces en su casa hace dieciocho. Poco a poco y gracias a su esfuerzo y al de su esposo, ha podido conseguir un acuerdo con una empresa de golosinas para ser los distribuidores exclusivos de una marca de dulces y snacks.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more shoes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-30T00:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oliver F.

With his many years of construction experience, he decided to become his own boss two years ago.\r\n\r\nWith his loan from ACCION USA, Eloy will purchase two jackhammers and other equipment for demolition work. He has found ACCION USA's financial education program very beneficial as it has provided helpful information and great support.\r\n\r\nEloy dreams of being able to grow his business and employing others. By doing this he will be helping not only his family, but his workers' families as well, he says.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":482172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

She is very well known in the market and has a good reputation. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":619927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of pots, plates and glasses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo (Rep.)","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2010-10-17T12:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":14300},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":14500},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":14700},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":14800},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":15200},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":15300},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":15500},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":15700},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":15900},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":16100},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":16200},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":16400},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":16600},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":16800},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":17000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.9},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.44},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.1},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.54},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.98},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.08},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.96},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.46,"local_amount":14300,"processed_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":14709.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177433231},{"amount":163.24,"local_amount":74200,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":76324.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182572728},{"amount":137.28,"local_amount":62400,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":64186.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188708573},{"amount":180.62,"local_amount":82100,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":84450.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191446544},{"amount":37.4,"local_amount":17000,"processed_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:55:10Z","rounded_local_amount":17486.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195868144}],"funded_date":"2010-10-17T13:57:50Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:55:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":243592,"name":"Segundo Manuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Segundo Manuel C.

Manuel lives in his own home with with his wife, his daughter and son-in-law, and two grandchildren.  \r\n\r\nAgriculture has been, and will be, the activity that keeps him and his family, and over the course of all these years he has learned the agriculture business.  He grows potatoes of the \"de color\" and \"\u00fanica\" varieties on the parcels of land on his property, as these are the types that are most requested.  He also grows peas of the \"super mejorada\", \"otrillo\" and \"rondo\" varieties.  \r\n\r\nWorking in the fields signifies more to Manuel than just a means of sustenance.  It is a recreation, an art, a dedication.  His plants are tended with love.  He brings the same approach to his work buying and selling cattle, both bulls and cows.  He puts the cattle to pasture and fattens them up, obtaining earnings of about 200 soles per head.  At the same time, he sells the milk produced by his cows for either direct consumption, or for making cheese and other things.\r\n\r\nManuel sees himself working in agriculture until the end of his days.  He wants to expand his farming lands and generate more earnings.  \"Here I was born, and here I will die\", he tells us between laughs.  \r\n\r\nWith your help, Manuel will receive his 13th loan with MFP, and so he agrees to be punctual with his repayments.  \u201cSanto Domingo de Tapo\u201d is the name of his communal bank, in which he feels trust and confidence.  He will invest the money from his loan in purchasing pea seeds and farmyard manure.  He has allocated 370 soles for each 25 kilo bag.  The remaining money will be used to pay for labor for sowing, tending and harvesting his land.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":919119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy pea seeds, sacks of manure and to hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-18T03:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2028,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097916}],"funded_date":"2011-11-19T03:42:59Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":362463,"name":"Las Vecinas (Cuenca) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal Las Vecinas, est\u00e1 formado por 8 socias y 1 socio quienes trabajan en diferentes actividades, las mismas que le permiten solventar los gastos del hogar y as\u00ed salir adelante con su familia.

Reyneria's job is selling food. She goes out early in the morning to the market seeking fruit and vegetables to be able to have the best for her faithful customers. They go to her locale seeking the varied and delicious and innovative dishes she makes. She only sells juices and some sandwiches in the morning and at 10 she begins to sell from the menu. She does all her work at her house where she set up some tables and chairs to receive customers. In addition, she also sells soft drinks. She does all the work herself, since her husband works at other activities. It is going very well for her. She makes a good percentage of what she invests and she feels that the effort she made at the beginning just to get her investment back is getting results now. She has customers that she earned during those 15 years that she has been doing this job. Now she is preparing to improve her infrastructure and make things more comfortable for her customers.

B. lives in the Abdurahmon Jomi region.  He is 46 years old, is married and has 6 children.  Mahmadrajab has a college education and is a veterinarian by profession.  He raises livestock.  Mahmadrajab purchases calves, fattens them for 40-45 days and then resells them at a higher price when they are worth more and are used for meat.  He then purchases new calves and repeats the process.  This is his business model.  This business helps to support his family as Mahmadrajab is the sole earner in his family. <p>\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the livestock sector allows for the provision of markets with quality meat at affordable prices.  Mahmadrajab has been in the livestock business for 22 years and will use this loan to purchase more calves.  He will pay back the loan over a 12 month period.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0411\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0435\u0432

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic services for women with low incomes.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Because they don't have Dominican documentation and don't speak the language well, their employment opportunities are limited, so they start their own businesses.\r\n\r\nMilagros sells different food items at her house.

She will use this loan to be well stocked in these products in order to meet the demands of her clientele.\r\n\r\nOne of Milagros' biggest challenges is collecting payments from the customers she sells to on credit.

Babayor is 57 years old and is married with two children. For more than thirteen years Babayor has been selling vegetables such as potatoes, onions, carrots, etc. His elder son helps him with the business.\r\n\r\nBabayor\u2019s business begins in the early morning at 5:00 a.m. He buys vegetables from the local farmers at wholesale and sells them in the market. Moreover, he is trading in a market that is known among people because of its attractive prices. All this allows Babayor\u2019s business to generate a stable and considerable income for his family.\r\n\r\nToday, Babayor is planning to purchase new, fresh vegetables to sell in order to increase the range of his produce. For this purpose he requests 4,000 Somoni. Having a positive credit history with IMON, Babayor promises to repay the current loan promptly as he did the previous loans. The well-being of his family is in your hands.\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His family lives in Korolyovo. Ivan sells household cleaning products and personal products in the central marketplace of his small hometown. Small ventures like Ivan\u2019s become the only source of income for families in remote parts of Ukraine. Ivan has been in the trade for 8 years. Currently, his inventory amounts to 40,000 Grivnas; his income is about 5,000 Grivnas a month. \r\n\r\nIvan\u2019s business is characterized by stability and positive performance.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started the business 15 years ago to help her family meet its education expenses, as well as water, electricity and food expenses. All of these items are very expensive. \r\n\r\nNow, Nenita has requested 20,000 PHP as additional working capital for her business. She is positive that her business will grow, since she already has regular customers in her local area submitting orders. Specifically, the loan will be used to buy more ingredients. She is pleased because, in the past, she has used the loans to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nWith working capital, Nenita's business will continue to grow and she will be able to provide excellent products to her regular customers. With the support of Kiva lenders, Nenita hopes to improve the standard of living for herself and her family and lift them out of poverty. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of having a permanent space in the marketplace where she can sell her food in order to earn a much larger income. She also dreams of her children completing college. Nenita is glad to ASHI for offering her happiness in life and group support in achieving her goals.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of her membership in ASHI, Nenita has been a model member, dedicated to managing her family\u2019s operations.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":672398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her family resides in Caloocan City.\r\n\r\nMichelle buys and sells clothes in the Ready To Wear (RTW) business. She sells clothes like shirts and pants to her business connections and friends. Also, Michelle sees a future in selling peanut butter, which she makes herself. This business is a hit primarily because Michelle gets the taste that favors the appetites of her customers. Monthly, Michelle is able to earn an estimated net income of around Php10,500.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she requests a Php15,000 loan. She will add this loan to the money she currently has in order to purchase more clothes and accessories, as well as ingredients for peanut butter, sugar and peanuts.\r\n\r\nShe recognizes that exhaustion keeps her down and becomes her major struggle, but she is determined to overcome the tiredness mentality, get enough rest everyday, and grow her business. She sees her business as a way to help her family and her community. Her hope is to give her children a bright future, and one step toward that is to be able to send them to school, up to college.\r\n\t\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

His small shop really prospered, thanks to accumulated profits and good managing that have made his capital grow to $800 in 2005.  \r\n\r\nHis ambition is to open a wholesale store one day, and so he was driven to join a HOPE RDC group in August 2008 called \u201cIsrael Plus\u201d in order to receive loans for supporting his dream.  He obtained a loan three times from HOPE and has repaid them completely.  The fourth loan he received in this past June was used to bolster the inventory in his shop by buying boxes of sardines, soaps, milk, sugar, baggies of Pure Water, etc. to resell with the goal of increasing his revenues.  Currently, his capital amounts to $1,200 and the profits realized monthly come to $250.  \r\n\r\nD\u00e9gaule is 35 years old, married, and the father of three children, ranging in age from 4 to 9.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Moreover, she has recently gone into business.  Bazarkul, since she was very young, has been a talented, skilled worker making traditional national goods. Relatives recommended that Bazarkul try making some handicrafts and offer them for sale in shops that specialize in that kind of merchandise. They have begun to buy her wares.  Bazarkul has an opportunity to spend her leisure time earning quite good money. To begin Bazarkul's business, she needed four thousand som ($90).

With her earnings she helps her husband, who is a farmer, to support the family financially. Martha would like to make improvements to her sound system, and in order to reach this goal she is asking for a loan of 500 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa [the Kiva field partner].\r\n\r\nMartha is a hard working woman who always gives her best to help her family get ahead. Her greatest desire is to keep working in order to help her husband to give the family a better quality of life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":568788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Improvement of a sound system","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caser\u00edo San Pablo - Pomalca - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-07-20T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":77.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.22},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":82.49},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":84.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":87.13},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":90.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.84},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.29},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.91},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.85},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.84,"local_amount":77.11,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:48Z","rounded_local_amount":87.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618471},{"amount":31.29,"local_amount":78.22,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":88.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832868},{"amount":33,"local_amount":82.49,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":93.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099470},{"amount":33.91,"local_amount":84.78,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":95.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554861},{"amount":34.85,"local_amount":87.13,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":98.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530257},{"amount":36.11,"local_amount":90.27,"processed_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":101.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666380}],"funded_date":"2010-07-20T20:58:28Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

However, her husband passed away and that dream was left to Evaluz to accomplish. At age 56 and a widow, she did not lose hope that she could still fulfill the dream of having their own house. Though life became tough for her, she never gave up. Instead she worked hard in order to perform her responsibilities as both father and mother of their three children. \r\n\r\nTo have access to capital to start a small business, she joined Ahon sa HIrap, Inc.- a partner micro-finance institution of KIVA in the Philippines - in the year 2006. During those years she experienced hardship but she was so determined that she stayed active in her membership. She is one of the very good members of ASHI and serves as a model to her group and to the center. Her business is doing well and her profit helps in providing the daily needs of her family. \r\n\r\nNow she is applying for another loan of 14,000 PHP to use as additional capital for her store. She will buy more grocery products, canned goods, bath and detergent soaps, liquors, cigarettes, rice, sugar, cooking ingredients, shampoos, assorted candies and snack foods. She will also buy assorted toys in preparation for the Christmas season. \r\n\r\nShe was able to send her children up to high school and is still dreaming of sending them to college someday. She hopes that with this additional capital she can earn more and save for the schooling of her children and hopefully start building their own house. She is optimistic that she will reach all her dreams with the help and support of ASHI and KIVA, and of course with the blessing from our Creator.

They have a son, Jimmy, 11, who they care for and educate in their own home located in Las Palmas in the Peruvian jungle.\r\n\r\nFrom a very young age she has been farming so she is quite knowledgeable about farming techniques and proper crop care.  She has been farming on her own fields for 10 years now.  She grows a variety of citrus plants.  However, this isn\u2019t Gladys\u2019 only occupation.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Since childhood she has been participating in income-generating activites, particularly scraps of fabric re-sewn into clothes and food seasonings with her mother. With 20 years of experience she enjoys an unparalleled reputation and notoriety in the town of S\u00e9gou. In order to deal with frequent supply interruptions at the main market in S\u00e9gou, she decided to participate in the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso in order to build up sufficient stock for longer periods. During three years of collaboration with Soro Yiriwaso, she has received four solidarity loans with an association in her neighborhood and is on her second individual loan. With this current loan, she intends to buy 15 bags of onions from wholesalers in S\u00e9gou's main market or during the weekly markets in the villages of Tonan, Dougabouguo, or S\u00e9ribala.

He has been very familiar with agriculture since he was young. Thanks to his parents he knows how to work the land. Now he supports himself entirely from potato and wheat production. He works all day weeding, irrigating, and fertilizing his fields so that his production will be good. He has always liked weeding his fields because it is important and is lighter work than many of his tasks. \r\n\r\nOzodjon wants to improve his family's quality of life; that wish provides the motivation for his arduous work. He will invest the loan in the purchase of seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants, with the aim of having the best production in his community in a few months. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The idea of having this kind of business crossed her mind when her husband, who is a fisherman, had caught more fish than usual in the lake. Elsa sold those in their neighborhood and she realized that selling fish brought bigger profits faster than any other kind of business she had in recent years. \r\n\r\nFish is salable because it is one of the most basic needs of human beings, especially for people who live in very remote areas of the province. They are far from the municipal markets. Thus buying from vendors who come to their community is very attractive. Also, more people choose to buy fish than meat because it is cheaper and healthier.\r\n\r\nFrom then on, Elsa used her loan from ASHI in her fish-selling business. Out of the profit she made, she was able to invest in her home and support her family financially. \r\n\r\nShe kept on borrowing from ASHI to keep her business growing. Now, she plans to use her newly received loan to increase the volume of fish she sells so that someday, out of her business profit, she will be able to invest more in her home. \r\n\r\nBeing a 46-year-old woman, Elsa wants her children to have their own livelihood.

Inicialmente acudi\u00f3 a pr\u00e9stamos de alto costo, con personas que le ofrecieron cr\u00e9ditos informales, aunque gan\u00f3 muy poco, esta fue su primera experiencia y con ello construy\u00f3 su principal clientela, pag\u00f3 todo sus deudas y continu\u00f3 poco a poco; su mayor desaf\u00edo es no tener un capital de trabajo suficiente, para responder a los pedidos de sus clientes de manera oportuna; esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a  la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 accesorios femeninos e infantil, productos de dulcer\u00eda y galleter\u00eda en general , que son los productos que presentan mayor rotaci\u00f3n en sus ventas.

","en":"Arleth is 27 years old and resides in the town of Soledad, which is 15 minutes away from the city of Barranquilla.  She lives with her husband and their three children who range in age from 11 months to 11 years.  She has a retail business selling all types of colognes, perfumes, sweaters, Bermuda shorts, and sweets.  This complements her other business of selling phone minutes from her home in the neighborhood of Villa Carmen.  These activities generate vital income to support the well-being of her family.  Arleth has an established customer base in the city of Barranquilla who submit their orders by telephone or whenever she comes to visit them.  She buys the merchandise from her distributors every eight days and pays her bills every 8, 15, or 30 days maximum.  Arleth has four years of experience in this business.  She started when she became unemployed.  Arleth had knocked on many doors to find work, but encountered very few options.  Therefore, she decided to start a business so that she could move her family forward.  Initially she accessed high-cost loans from informal moneylenders.  Even though she earned very little, Arleth was able to use her first experiences to build up her main customer base.  She continued to pay all of her debts and make gradual progress.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest challenge is not having enough operating capital so that she can fulfill the orders from her customers in a timely manner.  For this reason, she is accessing a Kiva loan, which is her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Arleth will use the funds to buy women\u2019s and infants\u2019 accessories, as well as sweets and cookies, since these products have high sales turnover.  Her dream is to become a professional, since she is currently studying to become a dental assistant.  Arleth\u2019s dream is to become a successful person, so this is her main priority.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer profits are no less than 50% and reinvested into her business so that she can continue moving forward.  Arleth hopes to use her loan to invest in more inventory so that she can maintain her stock at an even level.  The physical infrastructure of her business is small, but adequate.  Arleth\u2019s distributors have given her good references so that she can continue to manage her business relationships.  Likewise, her neighbors appreciate the persistence in her work and speak highly of her personality and the way she conducts herself in the market as an individual and as a small entrepreneur.

She has more than three years of experience in this job and has done it all by herself, since after she separated from her husband she had to find a way to be able to provide for her children and cover their education.

Celfita knows that she has to work very hard and is always persistent to bring something home.

She lives in dowtown Manta with her two children and her mother, who is confined to a wheel-chair due to illness.  She has managed to get ahead little by little despite many difficulties.  Because of her situation, she had to leave school and go to work during afternoons and evenings because during the morning she has to do her domestic chores, take care of her children and her mother.  A cousin babysits for her when she goes to work.  Her sister-in-law motivated Mar\u00eda Mairena to attend communal bank meetings and she liked the benefits the Foundation offered very much.  So, from that moment, she became a member.  She sells clothing door-to-door.  She began her business with help from her first, 300 dollar, loan from the foundation, which she used to buy stock inventory.  She travels to the city of Guayaquil each month to get her merchandise and brings back about 900 dollars worth each time; she tell us that she has regular customers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She will use this to buy necessary school supplies and other school needs. Also, she will use this money to help her pay the school bills. Her RTW business will also benefit from this loan.\r\n\r\nMarites does not deny that there are times when the mothers of students in her school do not pay on time. But because she knows the high value of education, she will not give up just because of her present struggles. Her dream for her school is for it to have elementary levels from Grade 1 to 6. \r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she allots one hour to attend their weekly fellowship* meeting.

Es la puerta de entrada a uno de los sectores precordilleranos de la regi\u00f3n Metropolitana, conocido como el Caj\u00f3n del Maipo, sector con espacios de caminatas, cabalgatas, rafting, entre otras actividades y servicios de alojamiento y alimentaci\u00f3n.\n","en":"Claribet is a member of the Eben Ezer community bank in Puente Alto, a suburb of Santiago.  \r\nShe has operated a produce business for 14 years.  She buys from the wholesale market at La Vega (a fruit, vegetable and grocery market).  She works near her house from Tuesdays to Sundays.  Her customers are passers-by but she has some long-standing customers, too.  She says that her shop is very well organized and that she even stocks her fruits by color.   Customers flock to her store because she stocks the best.  \r\nClaribet will use this loan to buy fruit for her store.  She wants to buy a new delivery truck because hers is a 1968 model.  She also wants to buy a temporary stand that she can break down and move for market days.  \r\nClaribet lives with two daughters, 26- and 30-years old, respectively.  She also has 3 grandchildren who range in age from 11-years old to just 5-months.  She comes from a family of retailers and she enjoys the work.  She likes the money she makes, too, because her income from the business supports her grandchildren and the rest of her family.  \r\nClaribet is grateful for the support she's received from Fondo Esperanza, the loans they've extended, of course, but also the free training they provide at group meetings.  The meetings are fun and she likes sharing ideas with the other members of the group with whom she gets along well.  \r\nPuente Alto is just north of Santiago, Chile's capital.  It was a small rural town at the end of the 19th century, but it has grown to be one of the largest towns in Chile, with a population of more than 600,000 people.  It's in the foothills that lie within the metropolitan area, an area known as Cajon del Maipo and famous for hiking, rafting and other outdoor activities.  It's know, too, for its restaurants and hotels."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":793836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &
