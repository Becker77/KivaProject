The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow large sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":215438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more chicks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-18T12:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-01T13:48:26Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970671},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886888},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436148},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130421},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:21:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027223},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613260},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010343},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232654},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664470},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105215}],"funded_date":"2008-10-18T13:48:26Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Wigg","image":1373520}},{"id":74454,"name":"Touch","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Touch T. is a villager in Prey Meilang Cheoung village in Takeo Province.

Of those four, the youngest two still attend the local school. She and her husband work as day laborers on the small farms of their neighbors, and, in small quantities, harvest their own crops like potatoes, peas and yams. She sees it as her obligation to wake up at sun rise to have time to prepare food and starts her work usually at 8 a.m., where they pay her 12 soles a day and her husband 15. In this way they are able to feed their children. She cultivates her own crops only when she has time, so she only harvests them once every six to eight months. Meanwhile, she labors arduously on the fields she's hired to work on. <p>\r\nHowever, now the couple is proposing a change in their lives. They want to focus more on their own land and produce their crops in higher quantities and of top quality. Jovita really enjoys working in her fields, so one of her goals of progress is expanding them. This is her third loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she promises to keep working hard with the same energy she that has taken her to this point. She is very satisfied with her community bank, above all because it helps her save money. She plans to use the 1300 soles she is requesting to purchase chemical fertilizers to enrich her potato fields. Meanwhile, in the field where Jovita took the photo, she will plant peas.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

She learned the trade from her friends and formed a partnership with her sister-in-law in order to buy sewing machines and embroidery machines which help her to optimize her work, producing better-quality garments more quickly.  This means that she saves time that she can then spend looking after her young daughter.

His business is the only source of income for his family. He has been in this business for four years.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and served as the location for the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent arable land. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She wants to invest the loan in the purchase of poultry, concentrated food, feed, and vitamins for them. She has a great deal of farm experience and she has the support of her entire family.\r\n\r\nThe primary obstacle she has had to face is the lack of funds to purchase raw materials. She does not have a stable market to sell her products and the drop in prices at which she is forced to sell these products.\r\n\r\nAna needs to start her days very early in order to attend to the household work, such preparing food for her children who attend school. Later on she works alongside her husband all day taking care of the farm work. \r\n\r\nAna and her colleagues have many dreams and goals to attain. Among the most important is the dream of self-improvement, improving the financial condition of their families, and to expand their small businesses. A great dream is to create a cooperative that will accept all that they produce to sell in large quantities and at better prices. The loan will be a great help for her and 8 group-mates.

He is 48, married with 10 children. He has no education and no regular job outside his house and raises livestock at home. He usually buys a few young bull-calves, raises them for 40-45 days and then sells them at a fair market price. After selling one or two bull-calves he buys another one or two, starts to raise them, while trying to sell the rest at the local market before they grow too big. This is one of the most popular businesses in the countryside which is especially profitable in spring and summer. Jafar has been doing this for 15 years already. Due to the bad weather this winter his business was slow and he needs a loan to buy one more bull-calf. It would help him to restore the business and to provide the income which his family needs so badly.

She says it was one of her proudest moments to finally be able to open her own business after saving for so long.\r\n\r\nJudith received her first loan from Tujijenge in 2008. Since then she has taken four loans and has been able to hire two employees at the barber shop and two more at the salon. She splits her time between the two locations, bringing her six-month-old daughter to work with her and caring for her while carrying out her work duties.\r\n\r\nWhile she was pregnant, Judith was worried about taking loans from Tujijenge because she was not able to work as much. Therefore, she did not receive a loan for the past two loan cycles. Now that she has given birth and is back to a regular work schedule, she is happy and excited to take another loan.\r\n\r\nJudith hopes to use this loan to invest in more supplies for her barber shop and salon. She will purchase items such as hair tongs, scissors, combs, brushes, hair weave (hair extensions) and other hair products. She says she hopes to use any extra profits to pay her children's school fees and medical bills. Right now, Judith makes a profit of about 615 US Dollars per month. Her businesses are especially busy on Saturdays and Sundays, or when her customers need their hair done for weddings.\r\n\r\nJudith will share this loan with the members of her group, Igembe.

Barbara has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional stock.

These spontaneous events make us strong, strengthen our belief in ourselves and keep us from becoming lazy. The heroes of this story are people who at the peak of unemployment, economic recession and political instability resolutely continue to do their work and step by step realize their dreams. Burulbu T. is the leader of this group. Burulbu is 57 years old. As the country was suffering from unemployment and hopeless people began to leave the country in search of work, Burulbu preferred to use the funds that she had in order to stay afloat. She has been familiar with livestock husbandry since childhood and decided that this would be her formula for success. Now she breeds cattle and sells milk. The sale of milk brings 2,800 som per month. Burulbu has five children and she never felt a lack of help. Through the joint efforts of the entire family, they built a house. Next, Burulbu successfully married her son. Not all members of the family work with the animals. Burulbu and her youngest son are involved in breeding cattle. Burulbu\u2019s husband works as a security guard at a parking lot; but in his spare time actively helps Burulbu with her work. One of her sons works at a sugar factory, while her two daughters have gone to work in Russia. The youngest son works in water management and helps his mother tend to the animals. Burulbu is requesting the loan to buy a washing machine, which has been her dream for a long time as it would lighten the load of her household chores.\r\n\r\nBurulbu\u2019s partners in the group: \r\n\r\nZhayangul S. is 25 years old. Together with her husband Zhayangul works in animal breeding and sells milk. She has a 4 year old daughter. Zhayangul hopes to get this loan to buy a refrigerator, so her milk will not spoil.\r\n\r\nArtykul T. is 53 years old. She is a widow and the mother of three children, and she is raising her grandchildren. Nevertheless, Artykul still works in animal husbandry. She is requesting the loan to buy fabric to make a dowry for her daughter.\r\n\r\nCholpon A. is 50 years old. She is a widow and mother of four children. Together with her son she is engaged in breeding cattle. Cholpon plans to use the loan to prepare a dowry for her daughter.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Melyakova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":559882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a washing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karabalta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-06-24T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burulbu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zhainagul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Atyrkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cholpon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5258},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5515},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5784},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6121},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6321},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6674},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":6977},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":7350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.68},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.24},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.06},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.49},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":115.68,"local_amount":5258,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5335.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670754},{"amount":121.33,"local_amount":5515,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5596.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884400},{"amount":127.24,"local_amount":5784,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5869.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151530},{"amount":134.67,"local_amount":6121,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6211.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177446554},{"amount":139.74,"local_amount":6352,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:57:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6445.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182585721},{"amount":461.34,"local_amount":20970,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":21280.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188721567}],"funded_date":"2010-06-24T23:53:51Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:01:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Melyakova","image":null}},{"id":214613,"name":"Eugenia Aureola","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eugenia Aureola O.

Tapi, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  meat vending and bakery businesses. Her husband Adilito D., who is 48 years old, helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 12 and 20 years old.\r\n\r\n Mary Ann joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 28 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mary Ann has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 29th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use as additional funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future and her children's education. Mary Ann D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is excited to do something different with her life and is ready to make a change and better her life with this loan investment.  She will use her share of this loan to improve her charcoal selling business and to expand to selling other miscellaneous products. She said her most difficult challenge has been to study.  That is why she is making an effort to help her children study and to take care of them.\r\n\r\nMemena plans to invest in her charcoal sale business, as well as begin selling other miscellaneous products. She will use her business profits to invest in her new activity.  She wants to start working harder toward having a little store. \r\n\r\nMemena's story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Beatrice will educate her children, ensure food security and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Majengo group will each plant  between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nBeatrice is pictured with her group members in the photograph.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":891833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs such as seeds and fertilizer at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-09T15:10:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abigael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wafula","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":63700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":63700,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":65170.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680592}],"funded_date":"2011-11-17T22:58:26Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":358075,"name":"Julie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julie works hard to support her family.

His day starts very early - by the time it's 8 a.m. he is already in the fields. Saul loves his work because he can see his efforts in his plants that will eventually be the harvest. Every year he has gotten very good yield and earnings. That's why he spends all of his efforts there, to produce large quantities of harvest. Sometimes his harvest suffers despite the use of fertilizers and pesticides, while other times he has enjoyed large harvests. Saul has an excellent harvest of potatoes and he has already gathered up many sacks full in his storage. Slowly he sells them, but before he shipped them all out to the market he decided to pose for the photo. This is his third loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). In the past loans he has not had any trouble paying them back and he hopes to keep up his record. He is a very happy client and his conversation always reveals his innate sense of joy, something that is very much appreciated by his colleagues in the community bank. Saul plans on investing the requsted funds in the purchase of chemical fertilizers for future potato plantations.<\/p>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":325661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-29T16:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sa\u00fal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:55Z","rounded_local_amount":705.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080712},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":806.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996851}],"funded_date":"2009-05-29T21:49:25Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":115446,"name":"Kossi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Kossi A. est un exploitant de carri\u00e8re de sable dans les banlieues de Lom\u00e9, la capitale togolaise.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her General Store, Rice Dealer and Hog raising businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.

Her previous loan of PHP 27,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.

Her husband helps in running the business and they have six children aged between twenty-five years old and twelve years old. Her business is located at a busy market in Kakamega. Kakamega is the region in Kenya known for production of sugar cane and it is known as the sugar belt region.\r\n\r\nShe makes and sells steel doors, windows and gates. She has been in this business for five years now and has two employees. She says that this business is profitable and the only major challenge she has is scarcity of materials for making the items that she sells. She also admits that being a woman, she has to work extra hard to convince the local people that she can do exellent work for them just like men. This is because this kind of business is male dominated. She works very hard to keep her business doing well.

In particular, they have a dairy farm with 8 milk cows. The family members produce and sell, on average, 150 kg of cheese locally. They have a lot of experience in cheese production and their cheese is of a high quality. Also, Yuri grows potatoes, haricots and onions on a family-owned plot of land. Vegetables are sold locally to the greengrocery wholesalers. Total average income of the family is 650 GEL per month, including the pension of Yuri\u2019s mother. \r\n\r\nYuri requested credit to purchase hay for feeding the cows during the winter period. Also, approximately 30% of the credit will be used for expansion of the cattle shed. In the near future, Yuri plans to increase the amount of cows on the farm, but the existing cattle shed doesn\u2019t allow him to keep more than 8 cows. After expansion of the cattle shed he will be able to realize his business idea, which will be followed by the increase of the family income, as well as improving their living conditions.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":864383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase feed for cows and construction materials for expansion of the cattle shed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kharjami","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2011-09-09T13:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yuri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":182.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":302.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244612798},{"amount":1642.5,"local_amount":2700,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2720.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250828047}],"funded_date":"2011-09-25T23:57:25Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:42:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":337580,"name":"Magdalena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magdalena is 42 years old and lives in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For 13 years she has been doing two activities that are essential for the livelihood of her home. First she began to manufacture artisinal guitars. She also offers the service of shows on the weekend in which she is the lead singer. She delights her audience with her melodious voice singing various songs. She has to work all week since she builds guitars with her husband, and weekends she sings with her musical equipment.

This is the sixth loan opportunity she has had with MFP. For the entire time she has been with the communal bank she has been very punctual with her payments.

Competition among them is really difficult, especially in food and cosmetic sales, because every member expects good results from her daily sales.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to stock their stores, buy more products and offer better services to their customers so that they will have more income and a better economic situation in the future. \r\n\r\nAs this is a new group, they have received

He has two wives and is the father of five children. He lives in his own home in Sienso, in the San prefecture. He masters the cereals business, having learned it from his father some twenty years ago. He has his own business in Sienso. He is very much in demand at the weekly markets of the town of San and nearby areas. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of expanding his business, two years ago he decided to seek assistance from the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso.

He buys his stock form wholesalers of Sienso, but with the increased working capital he plans to go directly to farmers to stock up. He sells in Sienso everyday,  next to the asphalted road, to a client base composed of women and men, on credit and for cash. He expects to achieve a monthly income of 40,000 West African Francs, which he plans to use for repaying the loan, with the rest used to cover school fees of his children and food. The rest will be reinvested in his business.

buying and selling rice grains; working as a rice retailer; and running a food vending business. She lives in E.B. Magalona, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005. She has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard at her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000. \r\n<p>\r\nMary Grace is borrowing PHP 12,000 so that she can purchase more inventory to sell. This will be her 8th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Mary Grace aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They will receive in-kind input loans from One Acre Fund to plant maize in 2012.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Maximillah and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nMaximillah takes care of six children at home with her husband.

Only the oldest attends school because the second-oldest is mute, and there are no schools for children with special needs in Namaacha.  Leopoldina and her family moved to Namaacha, a village on the border of Swaziland, in 1996 when her husband worked there as a border guard.  <P>\r\n\r\nLeopoldina studied through only 8th grade, and the sole way for her to earn a living was to enter the workforce.  Having worked as a barber in her youth, in 1998 she opened a hair salon in her home and was successful.  In 2006, however, her husband became sick, and she had to spend all their money to treat him.  He did not withstand the illness and lost his life in 2007.  After this tragedy, Leopoldina had no money to continue her business.  With three children to raise and six months pregnant, she counted on just her father\u2019s help.  Three months later she received an indemnity\/benefit payment for her husband\u2019s service.  For her children, she opted to leave the funds in the account for the length of the term because in addition to the original amount, she began to receive a monthly pension of 2,000 meticais (MTn).  With the help of Hluvuku (Kiva\u2019s Field Partner), Leopoldina transformed the old salon into a shop where she sells basic necessities.  She has had positive results and is able to raise her children and to save 2,000 MTn.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  She used the first loan of 15,000 MTn to buy products for her shop, and will use this second loan of 25,000 MTn to do the same.  In the future she intends to ask for more loans to invest in a chicken-selling business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

ventures:  fishing, fattening pigs and selling food. She lives in Prk. Tuboran, Brgy. Caghagan, Sipalay, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing, pig fattening and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). Rosita is now borrowing 20,000 PHP so that she  can purchase fishing gear and equipment. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 22,500 PHP (which she paid off well within its term) was just another step on her journey toward economic freedom. Rosita hopes to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the <i>Dungganon<\/i> way. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History <p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.  <p>\r\n\r\nTo learn more about IMON International's work, please visit:

Four women are its members; they all know each other and are neighbors.  They are:  Mrs. Lorenza E. C. who will use the loan to buy rice by the kilogram, eggs, pork, sausages, vegetables, cream, cheese and corn to prepare her meals; Mrs. Marlen Catalina V. V\u00e1zquez who will buy women\u2019s, men\u2019s and children\u2019s shoes on order and to have stock available to offer her customers; Mrs. Agustina C. R. who will buy merchandise like cloth napkins and tablecloths and thread, needles, buttons, elastic, clasps, hooks, etc.; to stock her business, Mrs. Melba Garc\u00eda Q. will buy blouses, skirts, pants, sweaters and men\u2019s clothes like pants and shirts.\r\n\r\nMrs. Agustina C. R. is a group member.  She\u2019s 57 years old and finished sixth grade of elementary school.  She\u2019s married and her husband\u2019s a farmer; they have six children:  Porfirio, 42, Ezequiel, 40, Jes\u00fas, 38, H\u00e9ctor, 35, Germ\u00e1n, 32 and Luis, 30.  All the children are married and work.  \r\n\r\nShe has a business selling notions, toys and women\u2019s articles like perfume, cosmetics and accessories.  She requested her loan to buy merchandise.  She will buy thread, needles, yarn, hoops, napkins and tablecloths to embroider and toys.  Her usual customers are young girls and women.  She offers them notions like napkins to embroider, thread, yarn, embroidery hoops, cosmetics, perfumes, toys and accessories for young girls and young ladies like hairpins, brackets, pendants, etc.  \r\n\r\nShe started her business 20 years ago needing to support her children.  She taught herself how to go to Mexico City on her own to get her merchandise.  She started out with just a few items.  She wouldn\u2019t spend anything but rather would reinvest all her profits back into the business.  She gradually grew and now she earns profits.\r\n\r\nShe went to work in the United States for two and a half years and saved up.  When she returned she built her business\u2019 booth so now is able to leave her merchandise there because before she had to take it back and forth from home.  She was also able to vary her merchandise and her business grew still more.  The space where she has her booth is borrowed and is in the town of Moyotepec a block and a half from home; she can walk to it.\r\n\r\nHer business is important because it helps her survive, it helps her fill her time and it amuses her while helping her.  When she\u2019s at work she is also working making felt arrangements that a friend is teaching her how to make.  She is proud of her business.  Thanks to God and the effort she\u2019s put into it she is proud to have this kind of business.\r\n\r\nHer husband helps her take care of customers and to set up the booth.  Her business is popular because of its location in the market and several people come by to buy.  The challenges she faces are the high costs because if the price of her products rises she has to raise her prices too.  Her business faces competition from another similar one in the market.\r\n\r\nShe uses profits from the business to cover needs like gas, light and sometimes the telephone and to reinvest.  What she likes are the profits; she has a separate investment already.\r\n\r\nAgustina is very happy with this loan because it allows her to stock her business, to become fulfilled and to enlarge it so that it will look prettier.  This business has helped her economically quite a bit.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019d like to make some home improvements like enlarge some of the bedrooms so that when her children visit with their families they\u2019ll have somewhere to stay.  Her plans and hopes are to continue progressing in her business and continue to save for when she is unable to work any longer.

Most of the people who live there earn their living making sweets that are typical of the region. To make them, they use amaranth, peanuts, seeds and tamarind, among other ingredients.\r\n\r\nThere are also sweets called obleas. Obleas are typical Mexican sweets consisting of two wafers with a dulce de leche filling. They often include condensed milk, pieces of chocolate, grated coconut, blackberry filling, cheese or jam. The wafers are usually made from wheat flour and measure approximately 20 centimeters across and 1 millimeter in thickness. Obleas originated in Huazulco since the inhabitants there were the first people to make these sweets. Obleas are exported to other places.\r\n\r\nLilia is one of the members of this group. She has a store where she makes and sells obleas. She is a very responsible, hardworking person. Lilia would like to invest in her store in order to improve it as well as her family's quality of life.

trabajadora. \nDesde hace 8 a\u00f1os Bridie vendia productos naturales para una empresa importante, pero su \u00edmpetu emprendedor y deseo de ser independiente, primaron ante la alternativa de seguir siendo empleada o empresaria de su propia microempresa. Ella decidi\u00f3 emprender su aventura de negocio y tom\u00f3 toda la experiencia de su antiguo trabajo y la tradujo en un negocio de venta de productos naturales en  punto comercial llamado \u201cTienda naturista Sol de Vida\u201d. Con un ahorro que habia logrado, hizo su primera inversi\u00f3n y hasta la presente le ha ido muy bien, por eso esta entusiasmada y quiere fortalecerlo, hasta lograr un crecimiento que le ayude a aumentar sus ingresos y con ello incrementar el bienestar de su hijo hasta llevarlo a que obtenga estudios superiores y potencialice su \u00e9xito en la vida.

Su mayor desafio es el capital de trabajo pues no es suficiente en la medida en que se incrementan las ventas y requiere tener un efectivo disponible para surtir especialmente con los puctos que mas rotan.  Mientras Bridie construye su sue\u00f1o a fuerza de trabajo y disciplina, continua esmerandose por sostener una rentabilidad sobre sus ventas no menor del 38% una rentabilidad sobre la inversi\u00f2n no menor de un 33%, para lograr su sostenibilidad.\n","en":"Bridie is 44 years old and lives with her son in Calle Real, a neighborhood which is located in the city of Cartagena de Indias, a beautiful and colonial city on the shores of the Caribbean sea which is frequently visited by both domestic and international tourists who admire its warm scenery and its kind and hard-working people.\r\n\r\nFor eight years, Bridie sold natural products for a well-known company.  However, her entrepreneurial spirit and her desire to be her own boss prevailed over the alternative of continuing to work as an employee and she now works as a businesswoman in charge of her own microbusiness.  Bridie decided to undertake her own business venture.  She took advantage of all the experience she gained in her old job and started her own business selling natural products from a commercial sales location called \"Tienda Naturista Sol de Vida\".  With some savings that she had made, she made her first investment and, up to now, her business has done very well.  For this reason, she is enthusiastic and would like to strengthen her business and achieve a level of growth that will help her to increase her income and, thereby, improve the well-being of her son so that he can pursue a higher education and be successful in life.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Bridie's first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy natural products such as green tea, bees' honey, fat burners, natural laxatives, etc.  Her biggest challenge is working capital as she does not have enough.  As she increases her sales, she needs to have cash available to stock her business, especially with the products that have the quickest turnover.\r\n\r\nWhile Bridie builds her dreams through her hard work and discipline, she continues to take care to maintain a profitability on her sales of no less than 38% and a profitability on her investment of no less than 33%, in order to achieve

This is the 6th time she has taken out a loan with MFP and is very happy to be one of the members who has a clean track record in handling loans and has proven to be punctual with her repayments.This time she will use the loan to buy products and ingredients to continue making her cakes of different flavours and textures.\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":864482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy products and consumables to make cakes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T07:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":436.32},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":469.74},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":487.68},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":512.82},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":535.9},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":557.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.98},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.24},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.82},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.03},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":196.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":159.98,"local_amount":436.32,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":436.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851268},{"amount":172.24,"local_amount":469.74,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":469.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666450},{"amount":178.82,"local_amount":487.68,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":487.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621603},{"amount":188.03,"local_amount":512.82,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":512.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835685},{"amount":196.5,"local_amount":535.9,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:05Z","rounded_local_amount":536.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245457},{"amount":204.43,"local_amount":557.54,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":557.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385507}],"funded_date":"2011-09-16T04:40:20Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":337612,"name":"Enkhtsetseg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Enkhtsetseg, 46, runs a grocery store selling basic food commodities.

help with the home expenses of her family. She thought that this activity was very practical because by doing it, she does not neglect her home and could take care of her sons. Years before she sold jewelry, but she left this business because she had to travel a lot to Guadalajara, Jalisco which is about 10 hours to Monterrey by bus and this was so difficult for her. Also she spent money in travel expenses so it was not advantageous. As she had a portfolio of clients already, she decided to find something different with demand and available to purchase in her city as well, so Maria de Jesus found her actual business of selling shoes and plastic articles by catalogue. She needs a loan for $850 and is asking for 6 months to repay the loan, because this time her shoe sales will increase for school season and for this reason she needs to invest in merchandise. She comments that this business makes her feel free and independent because her earnings are good and it is not necessary to request money from her husband for her basic expenses (and two of her three sons are in the university). She works for awhile every afternoon and every weekend she dedicates more time. She feels very happy with her achievements and Maria de Jesus does not discard the possibility of one day getting to have her own center of distribution.<\/p><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><p>SPANISH<\/p><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><p>Hace 2 a\u00f1os Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, decidi\u00f3 ponerse a vender calzado para ayudar con los gastos del hogar, consideraba que era una actividad muy pr\u00e1ctica, ya que con ella no descuidar\u00eda su casa y el cuidado de sus hijos. Antes vend\u00eda joyer\u00eda, pero dejo este negocio porque ten\u00eda que viajar a la ciudad de Guadalajara, Jalisco a m\u00e1s de 10 horas de distancia para traer la mercanc\u00eda, y esto se le dificultaba mucho, adem\u00e1s de tener que invertir en los gastos de viaje, y ya no le resultaba tan ventajoso. Como ya contaba con una cartera de clientes, decidi\u00f3 buscar algo que tambi\u00e9n tuviese demanda, pero que pudiese comprar en la misma ciudad, fue as\u00ed como dio con la venta de calzado y vasijas de pl\u00e1stico, las cuales vende por cat\u00e1logo y surte el pedido conforme lo demandan sus clientes. Esta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo de $9,000 a 6 meses, pues en calzado se le han incrementado las ventas con motivo del regreso a clases de los ni\u00f1os, por lo que necesita invertir en mercanc\u00eda. Ella comenta que gracias al negocio, se siente independiente, pues las ganancias son buenas y no necesita estar pidiendo dinero a su esposo para cubrir sus gastos m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicos. Ya que 2 de sus 3 hijos est\u00e1n estudiando en la universidad. Su negocio lo atiende un rato por las tardes y los fines de semana, que es cuando le dedica mayor tiempo.
