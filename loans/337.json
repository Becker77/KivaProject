Married and the mother of three children, she started her business about 13 years ago when she needed to find a job right away and business ownership was her best opportunity. She currently sells a range of men\u2019s shirts at the large central market in Tursunzde. Fotima has a reputation for treating customers with care and kindness, qualities that set her apart from many other businesses that often lack good customer service. Fotima has also proven to be a great client with IMON International, having successfully repaid 6 loans. She has requested a loan of 5000 Somoni to purchase new inventory and continue developing her business. \r\n\r\n<P>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This has been the experience of Elvira A. of Canonoy, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. Elvira is 49 years old and is married with four children who are between 18 and 25 years old.\r\n\r\nElvira's husband earns a living by fishing. Years ago, they owned a small unmotorized fishing boat that he had to paddle to go to sea. This was truly hard work, especially during stormy weather when the waves are a lot rougher than usual. But, because he had no other way to earn money to feed and support his family, he determinedly rowed his boat to sea everyday to catch fish, so that Elvira would have something to sell to people in their community and neighboring villages.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Elvira, with the consent of her husband, decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon so that they could borrow money to improve their income. With the new capital, Elvira opened a small general store so that she could earn a little more. As she made good on her loan repayments and established a good credit record, she was able to borrow larger amounts to improve her income potential.\r\n\r\nOne of their first investments from her loans was a joint decision to buy a motor for their fishing boat so that her husband could reach deeper waters and catch more fish - which he did. The motorized fishing boat and the income from the general store made a big impact on improving their family's quality of life. They currently earn a net monthly income of PHP 8,000 from their two business activities. The fishing business is doing quite well, so that Elvira and her husband are now saving up to buy another motorized fishing boat to increase their income even further.\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned here, Elvira has kept a good credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon. In her previous loan she borrowed Php 10,000 as additional capital for their businesses and, as is her usual practice, she was able to pay it off within the loan term and without any delays in the weekly installments. Now she is borrowing Php 15,000 so that they can finally purchase their second motorized boat. The income from it will be used to buy more productive assets so that they can continue improving their family's quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":423651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

por largo tiempo y desde muy temprana edad, trabaj\u00f3 como ayudante de electricidad en talleres informales donde gan\u00f3 una importante experiencia cuando se arriesg\u00f3 a hacer trabajos personales y fue as\u00ed como se dio a conocer; por cosas del destino, sali\u00f3 de su pueblo ubicado en el departamento del Magdalena con su esposa hace 4 a\u00f1os a vivir en Soledad, buscando una vida tranquila y productiva; inicialmente recibi\u00f3 del Gobierno Nacional un primer cr\u00e9dito de $1.000.000, con ese dinero compr\u00f3 repuestos y gradualmente fue agregando, una vitrina que poco a poco fue llenando de mercanc\u00edas y en este momento cuenta con vitrinas, estanter\u00eda, un escritorio de trabajo y gran variedad de herramientas para el trabajo diversificado que realiza; pues adem\u00e1s de ofrecer sus servicios como electricista, tambi\u00e9n realiza mantenimiento, reparaciones y adecuaciones domiciliarias, es decir se le mide a todo. Mario est\u00e1 casado y tiene 3 hijos menores entre los 8 y 11 a\u00f1os, su esposa lo acompa\u00f1a y tambi\u00e9n trabaja en su peque\u00f1a miscel\u00e1nea que atiende desde su casa y que le da la oportunidad de estar al cuidado personal de sus peque\u00f1os hijos, porque eso es lo que proporciona el tener un negocio en el mismo lugar donde se habita.

Este es su segundo cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n por valor de $ 1.600.000 con el planea comprar una vitrina y surtir el negocio; a Mario le ha gustado estar en la Fundaci\u00f3n por la sensibilidad social de sus asesores con ellos pueden ser sinceros para que la ayuda sea m\u00e1s efectiva. Sus sue\u00f1o es especializarse en electr\u00f3nica cuando el negocio tome un mayor auge, aumente su mercado y por consiguiente las ventas.

He managed to improve his skills when he received a technical degree from SENA when he was 22. For a long time, and since he was very young, he worked as an electrician's assistant in informal shops. There he gained valuable experience for when he risked jobs on his own and this was how he learned. \r\n\r\nFor reasons of destiny, he left his hometown located in the department of Magdalena with his wife of four years, to live in Soledad, looking for a calm and productive life. Initially Mario received his first credit of $1,000,000 COP from the National Government. With this money he bought spare parts, which he gradually accumulated, he bought a display case, and little by little he filled it with merchandise. Now he has display cases, shelves, a work bench and a great variety of tools for the various jobs that he does. In addition to the services he offers as an electrician, he also does maintenance work, repairs and remodeling, which he to say he does everything.  \r\n\r\nMario and his wife have 3 young children between the ages of 8-11 years old. His wife accompanies him and also does her own miscellaneous jobs that she can attend to from their home and which allows her the opportunity to care for their small children, this is the benefit of having a business in the home. They began with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo because of a friend that knew the organization well and had become a promoter of its benefits. This friend recommended them to the loan officer, Milgen S\u00e1nchez, because she knew that Mario and his wife were very responsible and that the couple is always seeking ways to improve themselves. When SENA brought trainings to their neighborhood, Mario and his wife participated knowing that it would help them to better manage their business. \r\n\r\nThis will be the second credit with the Fundaci\u00f3n for the amount of $ 1.600.000 COP. Mario plans to buy a display case and to support the business. Mario has liked working with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for the social sensitivity of the loan officers because Mario can be sincere with them so that they can help him most effectively. His dream is to specialize in electronics once the business takes off, increasing his inventory and as a result his sales. His greatest challenge is to obtain a home because his family is leasing. He hopes to qualify for the state programs to obtain homes so that he will no longer have to lease. Mario lives in a good neighborhood because his neighbors like his family and they all help each other, what's more there are many organizations that are based there to support families and especially his childrens' school where they receive a scholarship and Mario is very grateful for the school and he helps with the things that he knows how to do like paint, repair the walls and do electrical repairs. He has earned a good reputation with the director of the school and the faculty that educates his children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelly McKinnon, Kiva

Married to Christian Odo, a transport driver, Tossivi is the mother of seven children, only two of which she still supports.  All of her children attend school.  The couple lives together with their children.  Tossivi and her husband share the family expenses.  Tossivi\u2019s business is selling wood charcoal, both retail and wholesale.  She also sells vegetable and palm oil.  Tossivi sells her products out of her own home, but she does her buying at Bassila and Pahou, two large markets in Benin.  Though she never attended school, Tossivi has been managing her business for about 13 years.  Tossivi is a great client of ALID\u00e9, because she has received seven loans which have all been paid back.  Tossivi would like to buy a quantity of stock large enough to increase her profit margin, but she is limited for financial reasons.  This is why Tossivi would like to take out an eighth loan with ALID\u00e9.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Chelsea Rosendale, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":491879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing 100-kg bags of wood charcoal and bottles of peanut and palm oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-02-21T00:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tossivi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":15810.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136619362},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":15810.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653181},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:32:05Z","rounded_local_amount":15810.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835369},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":15810.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575763},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":15810.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954277},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":15810.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055937},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-27T10:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15810.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347470},{"amount":7.58,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3689.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617427},{"amount":39,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":18972.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191360847},{"amount":27.07,"local_amount":12493,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":13168.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195780073},{"amount":23.85,"local_amount":11007,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":11601.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401896}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T13:09:21Z","paid_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chelsea Rosendale","image":754499}},{"id":182215,"name":"Bunnarith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Bunnarith H. is a motor remoque driver and has been married to Mrs. Sokmoeun Yoy since 1994.

The oldest is 4 years old and next year he will begin kindergarten. \n\nOne of Leticia and Freddy's dreams is to save enough money to be able to buy a small house. Leticia worked with our institution for a previous loan and proved herself to be very punctual and responsible with the repayment.

She is married to Nche Michael Nji and they are blessed with five children.

Amongst other challenges, she needs more capital to be able to continue with her projects and personal life. \r\n\r\n<p>With this loan, G. plans to cultivate maize, beans, yams, cassavas, and huckleberries. She also intends to buy improved maize seeds and yams for her farm plot and stock petrol and firewood to sell. The loan will help her community because they will be able to buy petrol and firewood at affordable quantities and prices. G. will reinvest her profit into her business and use a fraction of it to pay for her children's education and upgrade her standard of living. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow-up and the moderate interest rate.\r\n\r\nABOUT GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

His passion for agriculture led him to acquire his own land, where he has been working independently for 11 years. He cultivates cocoa plants and coca leaves in his fields. At harvest time, he counts on the help of laborers to pick both crops with greater speed, so that he can complete the work more quickly. He feels very committed to his work, and thanks to his daily efforts, today he is able to see the fruits of his labor. He earns a good profit for each kilogram of product sold.\r\n\r\nHe explains that the winter season is not to his liking because in those months there is an abundance of insects and rain, which keep him from doing his work and can damage his crops.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan will be used to buy more cocoa plants, which he will then graft in order have good results in little time. For now he is prioritizing the purchase of new lands to expand his planting and increase his production. This is his second loan through MFP and he is prepared to make all of his repayments punctually, as he would like to be able to access more credit in the future.

She owns and operates a business venture, selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community.  She has two years of experience in this business.  Tafao needs a loan of $1,500 Samoan Talas (WST) to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 WST or $167 US per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tafao joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Tafao's third loan with SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: In 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":164746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of rice, flour, fruits and vegetables in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-05-31T20:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-16T07:30:34Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-07-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":33223.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":268961},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-08-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":33223.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":298077},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-09-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":33223.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":328655},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-22T07:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":33223.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":362588},{"amount":25.5,"local_amount":27818.2,"processed_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":30257.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347716},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":32630.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970304},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":32630.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886554},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":32630.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435839},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:18Z","rounded_local_amount":32630.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130144},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":32630.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36026977}],"funded_date":"2008-06-02T07:30:34Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":54439,"name":"Path","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Path H., age 41, is a true entrepreneur working in the Prey Veng province.

Institute Magburaka, Tonkolili District, Northern Sierra Leone. Government Technical Institute, Magburaka, was founded in 1962 by the government for the promotion of technical and vocational education. They teach mechanical engineering, carpentry and joinery, block laying and concreting, automobile engineering, plumbing and sheet metal work, painting and decoration and many more. Presently, the institute has a total of fourteen staff and twenty-five students. \n\nThe ten years old civil war tremendously disrupted the smooth running of the institute. Before the war, the institute used to have an enrollment of about 200 \u2013 300 students. In 1997 \u2013 2002, rebels vandalized the whole institute \u2013 buildings were unroofed, labs and libraries destroyed. However Sababu Education, a World Bank sponsored project is currently rehabilating the institute. But the project does not call for reequipping the laboratories and libraries.\n\nGovernment Technical Institute Magburaka is the only government technical institute in Magburaka town. Over the years, the institute has been able to train so many technicians serving both within and without Sierra Leone. It makes good grades at the external examinations organized by City and Guilds of London Institute. The institute also serves as a consultancy and guard to the people of Magburaka. \n\nThis is the first loan Government Technical Institute is requesting from Kiva through SMT. With this loan, some of these teachers will start a small business and those who are already running small businesses will invest the loan into their businesses. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children in their education or pay for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in home building projects.  \n\nDavid E.A. K. is the principal at the Institute. He has been a teacher for forty-three years now.  Mr. K. (right) was born in Makurgbo, nine miles from Magburaka. He is sixty-one years of age, married to a teacher and the two of them have five children. Four of their children are in secondary schools and the eldest is already a grown-up. Mr. K. will use his loan to pay his children\u2019s school fees and solve many of his domestic problems. \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":288764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To pay school fees for children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Magburaka, Tonkolili","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-03-18T17:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amadu E.d.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David E.a ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santigie A.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfre A.w","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hudson S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel B.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brima S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":8200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":820000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":270,"local_amount":820000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":822150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128936},{"amount":270,"local_amount":820000,"processed_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":822150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025756},{"amount":472.5,"local_amount":1435000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T07:55:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1438762.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008559},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":1025000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1027687.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230896},{"amount":270,"local_amount":820000,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":822150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662622},{"amount":270,"local_amount":820000,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-22T11:11:13Z","rounded_local_amount":822150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102902},{"amount":270,"local_amount":820000,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:07:44Z","rounded_local_amount":822150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019916},{"amount":270,"local_amount":820000,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":822150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864761},{"amount":270,"local_amount":820000,"processed_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":822150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110754570}],"funded_date":"2009-03-19T02:33:39Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:39:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Brooks","image":643421}},{"id":99514,"name":"Elie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elis is a 28 year old man who lives in Bint Jbeil, southern Lebanon with his parents.

Despite her young age, she has bought a piece of land on street 47 of Chasquipampa. She stopped working and formed a family and is totally devoted to her household, attending to her son who has had a health problem since birth. To receive revenue in order to get contruction going on her already acquired land, she has decided to supplement her income by starting to mass produce empanadas, berlins, cakes and pastries, without even thinking of the agreable flavor that she makes in the production of the pastries. \r\nThus she began selling small amounts in the south, beginning only with small quantities. Today she sells pastries in two of the schools with the most students in the south, and further prepares these types of dishes in contracts for customers who already know her or know of her pastries. She does this work at home so she can attend to her family in a normal way as she wishes. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Hopkins, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":307818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To build capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackelline Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":2400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":179.21},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":182.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":186.36},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":190.03},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":193.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":197.6},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":201.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":205.48},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":209.53},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":213.66},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":217.88},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.13},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.65},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.18},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.71},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.26},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.39},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.97},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":135.06,"local_amount":926.13,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":948.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439670},{"amount":58.6,"local_amount":401.81,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":411.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52950190},{"amount":30.12,"local_amount":206.55,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T12:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":211.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63167130},{"amount":93.82,"local_amount":643.06,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":658.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73592588},{"amount":32.4,"local_amount":222.45,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T15:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":227.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87027966}],"funded_date":"2009-05-02T05:15:58Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T15:54:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Hopkins","image":null}},{"id":107706,"name":"Leo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leo E. makes a living growing rice.

She lives in a house that was willed to her by her parents and she\u2019s very eager to move forward with her life.  It\u2019s been 5-years since she started her dental practice; she had little faith that it would do well, but she worked hard and without rest she set out to achieve these goals.  She maintains her practice always keeping it clean and ensures the highest level of courtesy for her clients.  She very much enjoys her work as she attends to her clients and knows what are the best ways to help people to achieve better health.\r\n<p>\r\nIt took 15-years to learn these skills and she believes the biggest challenge is working these long hours as the office is generally filled with people.

She is aware of the path to her goals is long and requires sacrifice, but she is determined to work hard to achieve them.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the 5th loan request with MFP and she promises to be punctual with her debt as she does not want to jeopardize things for her community bank members whom she cares for and respects.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mr. Tuvshinbold is professional welder but currently he runs a taxi business, carrying people around Ulaanbaatar city and bringing extra income to the family. He earns around $290 a month from his taxi business. \n\nThe house he built is not complete yet and the entrance, windows and insulation needs to be done. The Mongolian winter is one of the harshest in the world. The temperature in winter time, especially at night, drops to -40 degrees of Celsius. Therefore, the houses should be well-insulated from the cold. Currently most households in Ulaanbaatar city use coal fired stoves for heating which pollutes the air to dangerous level. The Mongolian government takes some measures to improve the air quality by helping to replace coal fired stoves to gas ones and improve the insulation of the houses. Well-insulated houses require less charcoal to burn, emitting less poisonous smoke into the air and helps to save on heating costs of households. \n\nThe loan he is asking for will be used to pay for insulation materials for the walls, double-glazed windows and other building materials to finish the house and to make the house warm and well-insulated from the cold.

She is married to  Djamiou Agbangla and is the mother of two children: the elder is named Latifatou. He is 15 and in the fourth year at the lyc\u00e9e. Her second child is called Jalale; he is 9 and is in the 5th grade in primary school. <P>\r\n\r\nThe needs of Sabitiou's family are covered by her husband. Sabitiou and her family live in Agbodj\u00e8do, an outlying neighborhood near Cotonou, economic capital of B\u00e9nin. Sabitiou came to Cotonou at the age of 15, after having left off schooling. As soon as she arrived, Sabitiou began to sell potatoes, door-to-door, that is to say, she would go from house to house with a tray of potatoes on her head. <P>\r\n\r\nAfter three years, aided by her husband and her parents, Sabitiou diversified her business. Today, she sells vegetables, fruit, drinks, liquid soaps, etc. Sabitiou sells in the center of the city of Cotonou. Most of her clientele is made up of foreigners living in B\u00e9nin (Lebanese, French, Americans, etc.) The demand of her clientele has become quite big and to satisfy it, Sabitiou needs more working capital than she presently has. <P>\r\n \r\nThe word \"Alid\u00e9\" in Fon, the native language of Benin, means \"there is always a way for the poorest\".

Alid\u00e9 offers special 0% interest rate loans to very vulnerable persons and the organization is part of a group which will soon launch a micro-health insurance program to beneficiaries of micro-loans. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":298169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"purchase of vegetables, fruit, drinks in cans and bottles, mineral water, liquid soap, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-04-03T19:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabitiou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":18000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":36000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":36508.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396345},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":18254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904241},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":18254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126275},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":18254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549706},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":18254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983497},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":18254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96895866},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":18254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735447},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":18254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110622971},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":18253.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019678}],"funded_date":"2009-04-03T23:14:06Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":103626,"name":"Martina Martha","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra Martha tiene 51 a\u00f1os de edad ella cuenta con la actividad de venta de carne, desde hace 38 a\u00f1os, el puesto lo heredo de su mama;

She lives in her own house with her 50-year-old husband Hern\u00e1n and their 3 children: Julio is 21, Roxana is 17, and Hugo is 11. Her children are the motivation for all of her efforts. Her handicraft shop is a very profitable business, since she has several customers who come to her establishment to buy decorations and other items. She starts working very early in the morning and stays in her shop practically all day, since she knows that she has to work very hard to achieve her goals. What Nery likes best about her job is that she can do household tasks at the same time that she is working at her shop. She has been working this way for 12 years and what she likes the least about it is having to stay inside her shop all day without being able to go out into the street. For the future, Nery wants to improve the infrastructure of her shop so that she can provide her customers the service that they deserve. This is her third loan with MFP and she feels the responsibility to pay her dues on time, since she desires access to more loans in the future. In her village bank she is one of the most active partners. With the 2000 nuevos soles that she is asking for she will buy new materials to build more handicrafts to sell and therefore improve her economic gains. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelley Maynard, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":347167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-04T18:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211969},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641497},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080936},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997078},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:12Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842427},{"amount":113.05,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":344.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842428}],"funded_date":"2009-07-05T05:35:10Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelley Maynard","image":248986}},{"id":124106,"name":"Afiyo","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette femme est tr\u00e8s dynamique et vit avec son \u00e9poux et ses trois enfants dans le quartier d\u2019ago\u00e8 cacav\u00e9li.

She is sometimes able to save some money in her bank account.\r\n\r\nAngelica has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through colleagues of hers who also work with the institution. This is her 1st loan, for the amount of 15,500.00 Meticales. She plans to use this money to buy construction materials (zinc plates, cement, a wheelbarrow and other items) in order to start construction on her house.\r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future she would like to apply for more loans to continue with her home construction project. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

His family lives in a small house in the outer ger (nomadic tent) districts of the city. \r\n\r\nWhen Batjargal first began his carpentry business in 1995, he used to rent a workplace to make furniture with 300,000 MNT of working capital.

He makes furniture at his own workplace, which is next to his small house, and he sells them at Narantuul, the largest outdoor market in Mongolia. For the last 16 years, Batjargal has been supporting his family as well as improving their living conditions with his business profits.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Philippine Pesos (PHP) worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and then selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a 24,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nTeresita hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The community of Kopudo village collects their drinking water from Kamigori borehole because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Kopudo\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. In Kopudo, 30 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Rose has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are 3 other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: namely Bernard, Rose and Margret.\n\nKopudo village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Rose believes that the dispenser system will  help them to treat their water leading to eradication of  water borne diseases. \n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Rose\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1803574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To allow her community to treat water to make it safe to drink using chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":978089,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello, lenders.

As a child he was an excellent student, but upon finishing his studies he was unable to find any work due to the severe economic problems in his country.  Instead, Kodirjon decided to invest his small savings to start his own business whereby he sells rice at the market.  Over time he has expanded his business to the point that the business is now the sole source of income for his family, which consists of his wife and three children.  He explains that there is high demand for his rice because of its excellent quality, size, and flavor.  As a result, Kodirjon is applying for a loan in the amount of $800 in order to buy more goods for resale purposes.  In turn, he expects to generate more income, which will enable him to improve his family's standard of living. <p>\r\n \r\nInformation about Tajikistan:\r\nTajikistan is well known for the following: (1) its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; (2) the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and (3) its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi, to name a few.  The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.  On the other end of the spectrum, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and thus only 7% of the land is arable; accordingly, this confluence of factors has resulted in high levels of unemployment and has forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries (primarily Russia).  Even though the people of Tajikistan are working hard to improve the country's agriculture and manufacturing sectors, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON International's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She lives with her husband, who is an art professor and they have 2 children who go to school.\r\nTwo years ago, she patiently began to breed chicken. With her method, they can gain a nice weight, which allows her to sell them at a fair price.\r\nThey are ready every 45 days, and she sells them to regular buyers in her area. She also sells fast food at night, (hot dogs and fries and chicken nuggets) and even though she started only 2 months ago, the business is very successful.\r\nThe hardest part of her business is not to have adequate facilities for her animals, as the breeding process occurs in the open air at her house. Her dream for the future is to open her own restaurant of bakery.\r\n\r\nThis is her 8th loan with MFP and what she likes about her group is that everybody is very responsible with their payments. Carla needs to hire a contractor to build a shed for her chicken. She will use the money she's requesting at this time to buy construction materials, as well as chicks and breeding food.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jimena Lopez, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":446147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Build a chicken shed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-10T19:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":222.1},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":223.15},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":232.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":247.37},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":252.22},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":264.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":272.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":285.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.74},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.1},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.28},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.49},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.74,"local_amount":222.1,"processed_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":223.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734907},{"amount":78.1,"local_amount":223.15,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":224.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124231},{"amount":81.33,"local_amount":232.38,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":233.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959971},{"amount":86.58,"local_amount":247.37,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":248.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992817},{"amount":88.28,"local_amount":252.22,"processed_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":253.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717605},{"amount":92.71,"local_amount":264.88,"processed_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":266.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751280},{"amount":95.49,"local_amount":272.84,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":274.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933814},{"amount":99.77,"local_amount":285.06,"processed_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":286.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672711}],"funded_date":"2009-12-11T16:26:52Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jimena Lopez","image":249667}},{"id":165366,"name":"Alcira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alcira tiene 42 a\u00f1os, vive junto a su esposo Teobaldo, de 46 a\u00f1os, y con sus 3 hijos: Henry de 15, Anal\u00ed de 13 y Maick de 5 a\u00f1os.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need. <p>\r\n\r\nTo learn more about IMON International's work, please visit:

Correa lives in Ciudad del Este with his wife Antolina and his two children. <p>\r\nMany years ago, Santiago started working in a bookstore called Cassol, where he gained experience in the field. Tired of being an employee, he decided to open his own bookstore in the shopping center of Ciudad del Este. Santiago sells articles used in writing such as paper, pens, quills, inkstands, pencils, and blank books. It is worth mentioning that the store is located in a strategic place, because Ciudad del Este is a commercial city. Usually Paraguayans go to Ciudad del Este only to buy things; from electronic devices to clothes. <p>\r\n\r\nBesides the bookstore, Santiago owns a grocery store.

The residents of Santa Cruz have the good fortune of waking up each day and experiencing the beauty of the lake at first sight.  This town is divided between the indigenous residents, who live their lives in a very traditional way, and a group of expatriates who are currently investing a great deal in the tourism industry.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe women of Santa Cruz used to live in absolute poverty and without much hope of getting ahead, until a few years ago when \u201cGringa Lil\u201d began to organize women together to request loans from microfinance institutions.  Thanks to the efforts of this industry the town began to grow.  This is how the Friendship Bridge began operations in Santa Cruz. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nAll of the women work with textiles.  Half of the group work as weavers of huipiles (typical blouses) and rebosos (scarves), while the other half work as embroiderers.  They embroider the huipiles or beautiful colorful blouses.  They reinvest their profits in the purchase of threads to weave or embroider their fabrics.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Elenas de la Cruz sell their products in the market of their town.  They also sell in neighboring towns.  The interesting thing is that from Santa Cruz to other potential markets like Jaibalito and Tzununa, one can only reach them by boat.  The ladies load their baskets with merchandise and then proceed to carry the baskets on their heads to the boats which carry them to neighboring towns.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis group of women would like to continue investing in their businesses, because they want their businesses to grow in order to continue helping their families.  They dream that their children will be able to continue going to school all the way to graduation.  You can help them reach their dreams.

Los pobladores de Santa Cruz tienen la fortuna de poder levantarse todos los d\u00edas y experimentar la belleza del lago a primera vista. Este pueblo est\u00e1 dividido entre los pobladores ind\u00edgenas, los cuales viven sus vidas de una manera muy tradicionales y un grupo de expatriados que actualmente est\u00e1n invirtiendo mucho en la industria del turismo. \r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres de Santa Cruz viv\u00edan en la pobreza absoluta y sin mucha esperanza de salir adelante, hasta que hace unos cuantos a\u00f1os la \u201cgringa Lil\u201d empez\u00f3 a juntar a mujeres para que solicitaran pr\u00e9stamos a las instituciones de microfinanzas. Gracias a este esfuerzo esta industria empez\u00f3 a crecer en este bello pueblo. As\u00ed fue como The Friendship Bridge empez\u00f3 operaciones en Santa Cruz. \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las mujeres trabajan en el \u00e1rea textil. La mitad del grupo trabaja como tejedoras de huipiles (blusas t\u00edpicas) y rebosos (pa\u00f1uelos), mientras que la otra mitad trabaja como bordadoras. Ellas bordan los huipiles o bellas blusas de colores. Ellas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en la compra de hilos para tejer o bordar sus tejidos. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Elenas de la Cruz venden sus productos en el mercado de su pueblo. Ellas, tambi\u00e9n venden sus productos en los pueblos aleda\u00f1os. Lo interesante es que de Santa Cruz a los otros mercados potenciales como Jaibalito y Tzununa solo se puede llegar por lancha. Las se\u00f1oras arman sus canastos con mercader\u00eda y proceden a cargar los canastos en sus cabezas hasta las lanchas las cuales la llevan hasta los mercados de los pueblos aleda\u00f1os. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de se\u00f1oras quieren seguir invirtiendo en sus negocios porque ellas quieren que sus negocios puedan seguir creciendo para seguir ayudando a sus familias.

There is electricity, but no piped water at her home. The family gets three meals a day.

The need to support her son made her start selling animals.  Usually she goes to sell them twice a week in the city of Chiclayo.  She also sometimes sells to businesspeople who frequent the area.  She hopes to expand her business.  She tells us that some neighbors have offered to sell her animals, and she wants to buy them, but she doesn't have enough capital to do this.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

of Ngh\u1ec7 An. In 2003 she contracted a loan of 200 USD. She used this money to buy a calf. After 4 months, she sold the calf for 250 USD. The profit from selling the calf was a big motivation factor for her to continue. She contracted another loan after that to start businesses of pig raising  and liquor making. The liquor making business brings in 2.5 USD daily. With this revenue, Mrs \u0110\u1ea1t repaid the loan and the daily expenses. The waste from her liquor making is used to feed her pigs, this helps cut the cost of pig food. Running both businesses in parallel is quite convenient, it helps reduce considerably the time it takes raising the pigs. Mrs \u0110\u1ea1t is requesting a loan of 325 USD. With this loan she would buy 8 breeding pigs and a peep of egg laying chickens. Selling the eggs would bring in enough revenue to pay her weekly expenses. For the pigs she hopes to sell them in the new year, this would bring in 500 USD. \r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nN\u0103m nay 44 tu\u1ed5i, ch\u1ecb \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb \u0110\u1ea1t s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 5 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con t\u1ea1i Nghi L\u1ed9c, Ngh\u1ec7 An.

Despite having two businesses, her daily income is not enough to make her business grow. \r\n\r\n<p><p>\r\nHence, Tessia is requesting a loan amounting to PHP7, 000.00 for additional capital. She would like to purchase products for her manicurist and beautician business, such as hot oils for her customer\u2019s hair and hair relaxing chemicals.  With the loan she will be able to increase the services offered to her customers and increase business, helping her provide for her children\u2019s
