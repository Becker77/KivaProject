He is a worker in the estate \"El Naranjal\" where he works Monday through Friday from 8 AM to 5 PM. However, Hugo likes agricultural activities very much so on the weekends he works on his own land since his salary is not enough. That is why he and his wife work pruning his citrus trees and fumigating several times in order to harvest healthy products, which  is sent to Lima in the summer time. During the summer months of January through March, fruits such as oranges and mandarin oranges are in high demand. Because of the fruits' good prices, Hugo collects a good amount of money which allows him to purchase furniture for his home and clothing for his children. That is why his future plans are to increase his plot of land.<p>\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP as he has shown to be responsible with his payments.

O. is 30 years old, and is a very responsible and hardworking man. He has been engaged in the business of fishing for over 16 years.  Carlos had to learn this business at a very young age, given that he had to support his 3 children and his wife, which he considers to be most important.  Every day Carlos gets up very early, since he must rig up his nets so that he can catch a lot of fish.  He has recently experienced problems with insufficient working capital.  He is currently requesting a loan for working capital that will be used to repair the motor of his boat, and to purchase new nets and certain tools that he uses in his business.

For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

He is 46 years old. Armando is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Armando owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing electronic repairs in the local community. Armando has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Armando joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Armando has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from GDMPC. Armando is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Armando from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 260 talas or US $108 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lili joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Lili's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score for Lili T.:*               1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n *SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She makes all sorts of clothes there.  She started out working as a hardware store employee while going to school majoring in business administration.  She started working making clothes because one of her girlfriends knew this occupation and Marisela liked it.  She started out buying fabric and accessories to make purses that she sold among her classmates and coworkers.  \r\n\r\nNoting the profitability of the business she dedicated herself to it exclusively and stopped being an employee.  She used her severance pay to buy a plain sewing machine and also an overlock machine taking advantage of the fact that her mother, who also knows this occupation, was willing to help her out.  Her main lines of work are women\u2019s dresses, uniforms and party clothes.  She pays cash for raw materials.

She spent a lot of money for surgery and treatment, which led to a decrease in her working capital. In spite of these complications, she is moving forward and applying for a loan. Using this loan, she plans to increase her current capital in order to purchase carrots to sell wholesale. It will allow her to reach the business level that she had before the accident.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Janylkan wants to buy a truck to deliver her products in a cheaper and easier way.

Edward, age 60, has been running an agriculture enterprise for over 20 years, and is still at his best proving to fellow agriculturalists in the area that he can make it.

He has been farming in Nyakirehe, Kihihi, earning 240,000 Ugandan shillings on a monthly basis out of his produce sales. The main drawback is harvesting low quantities and therefore, with this loan, he will purchase agricultural inputs like manure and more coffee seedlings. This will make it possible for him to get more output and to earn more revenue to care for his family of eight children and a wife at home.

Soon his income allowed him to broaden the household by purchasing more and more livestock. Currently, cattle breeding generates 3,000 soms per month.

This is 30-year-old Josephina N. from Mbeya. She is married and has three children between the ages of 1 and 13. She is also responsible for supporting one dependent whose parents cannot care for her. \n\nJosephina has been running a genge business since 1999. \"Genge\" is the Swahili word a type of outside shop or stall. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood with a tin roof where the proprietor sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place where local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\n\nJosephina works at her business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week, and is assisted by two employees. Josephina currently earns about $51 USD each month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $800 USD to purchase more sugar, kerosene, soap and cooking oil in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity of goods in order to get more profit from her business . Josephina thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":288038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more sugar, kerosene, soap and cooking oil in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T03:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine B.

She went to work for a company and became a long-time employee.  Unfortunately, she lost her job when her employer went bankrupt.  Around the same time, she acquired a piece of property in Santa Ana Los Olivos so that she could start over.  While moving into her new home, Victoria worried about how she was going to earn a living.  During a visit to a street market near her new home, she thought of starting a business selling condiments (chili peppers, spices, ground seasonings, etc.).\r\n<p>\r\nHer business started off badly.  She gradually gained a few customers, but being an informal street merchant is a risky proposition.  Having to acquire and guard her merchandise created double work for Victoria.  The municipal police would often come by and throw out her merchandise instead of asking her to remove it.  This created headaches for her because she had to deciD. between making a large purchase of inventory or make the sacrifice to save enough money to acquire her own spice stand.  Fortunately, Victory is happy to have her own business in an area that is well-kept and secure.

She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has many years of experience in this business.    Uila needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nUila joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Uila's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nFalefia, a loan manager at SPBD, asked Uila a couple of questions about her business.  Here are her answers:\r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score of Uila V. provided by SPBD:*               1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is 39 years-old and married with two school-aged children. Teresita owns and operates a  specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as sugar, snack foods, canned goods, candies, shampoo,  soap and toothpaste in the local community. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Teresita joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Teresita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her life was always increasing work, achievements and disappointments, that converted her into an optimistic and successful person. For twenty years, she has sold food in a market stall in the city, where with the help of her mother she also sells manufactured products made from plastic. Both activities permit her to educate her children and bring them a better life, although never beyond the necessities. The thing she likes best about her work is being attentive to her clients so that they return, which she considers a strategy that never fails.

In order to complete her plans, with the money that she is asking for now, she will buy a variety of plastic products in order to increase her sales and continue saving for her future shop. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lois Parshley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":491469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increasing merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-21T17:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luzmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":178.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993260},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":178.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718043},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":178.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751718},{"amount":43.74,"local_amount":116.64,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":124.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672960},{"amount":143.38,"local_amount":382.36,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":408.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154625}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T18:00:33Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lois Parshley","image":null}},{"id":181945,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is a single lady who lives and operates her business in Machakos.

Jovelyn has been engaged in her business for more than eight years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jovelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Jovelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Jovelyn is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Jovelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers, and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Having completed secondary education and with 8 dependents, she entered the food retail business in 2001 with initial capital of 50,000 FRS. Her daily revenue is now 10,000 FRS. She aims to use this loan to boost her business by purchasing boxes of milk, jars of jam (exeter, bull beef and rio), pasta, sugar, biscuits, fruit juice and other staple foods. \r\nShe saves money every day in order to help grow her business and so that she will have a good display of goods for potential customers, despite a rise in prices. Her goal is to have a large shop, and if possible eventually several others in the town, so that she can be a wholesaler in future. Her dream is to improve her children's living conditions so that they can continue their studies, and also to buy a plot of land.

It has five female members who all know each other and are neighbors.  The members are as follows: Guadalupe \u00c1vila M., who will use her loan to buy organic fertilizer to fertilize her 'nopal' (prickly pear) crop; Leticia L. C., who will buy organic fertilizer to fertilize her prickly pear crop and improve her production; Marquelia R. D\u00edaz, who will buy men's and women's perfume, cosmetics and cosmetic kits in order to stock her business; Herminia R. M., who will buy fruit such as custard apples, loquats and avocados, to stock her business, and Guadalupe R. \u00c1vila, who will buy prickly pear stalks and fertilizer in bulk, in order to start her own production.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe \u00c1vila M. is the group's representative.  She is 56 years old and studied up to the fifth year of elementary school.  She is married and has five children: 1 daughter and 4 sons.  Her sons are agricultural workers.  Guadalupe's husband sells firewood.  He goes out to the countryside and gathers firewood to sell.  Guadalupe herself has a plot of land where she grows prickly pears.  She has requested this loan to buy manure for her prickly pear crop so that she can produce more.  She started this business 5 years ago.  Previously, she used to grow corn and beans.  She provided her children with some land and they also grow prickly pear cacti.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe learned her business as a young child.  Her father always used to grow prickly pear cacti and she and her siblings worked with him, weeding, removing the stalks and chopping.  They would cover the chopped prickly pear with soil so that it served as fertilizer and they would remove the fleshy pads.  These days, they hire a rototiller that chops the plants and removes weeds but it is expensive to hire.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe bought the plot of land where she grows her prickly pear crop and her dad left her the house where she is currently living.  Her plot of land is in the countryside.  She either walks there or takes a taxi which leaves her on the edge of the road and she then walks to her plot of land.  Her business is important and special to her because in good seasons, if they pay her well for her produce, she enjoys working on her crop.  She feels proud when she receives good money for it.  Guadalupe's customers are those who arrive first in their trucks to buy her produce.  Those who arrive first and pay the most take the produce.  She cuts her prickly pear to sell every week or two weeks.\r\n\r\nThe challenge that Guadalupe faces in her business is that during periods of cold weather, the cacti do not grow.  Her business is very well known because people eat prickly pear every day with their meals and it also has healing effects.  Guadalupe faces competition from other people who produce prickly pear but everyone is free to sell their product wherever they most like.  Guadalupe re-invests some of the profits that she makes back into her business, investing in buying fertilizer for her next sowing season and she also buys food.  Her children help her in the business.  Her daughter and husband cut the cacti and her husband also carries the boxes of produce.\r\n\r\nTlalnepantla is a very pretty village.  The countryside is very green and covered with prickly pear cacti.  You can also see the nearby volcano.  The climate is cold and temperate.  Guadalupe's business has helped her family financially.  When they don't have any money they go and cut some prickly pear to sell and then have enough to cover their food expenses or anything else they might need at home.  Guadalupe would like to repair her home, laying floor tiles and painting it so that it looks nicer.  Her plans and dreams are to enjoy a better life and to have money so that she can do more things.  She would like to have another bedroom for her daughter's children as her daughter is a single mother and has two children.  The improvements that Guadalupe would like to make for her children's future is to ensure that they have somewhere to live and for them to be content.  She is very happy to be receiving this loan because it will help her a lot with her harvest.  It will help her to produce more and she hopes to pay it back properly so that she can access more loans in the future.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"We thank you for the loan that you are giving us because it will help us a lot.  It will help our businesses and families to grow\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":699848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer for her prickly pear crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TLANEPANTLA MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-26T15:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marquelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herminia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":385,"local_amount":4600,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4645.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850132},{"amount":577.5,"local_amount":6900,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6968.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292406},{"amount":385,"local_amount":4600,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4645.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160664},{"amount":385,"local_amount":4600,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4645.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233541},{"amount":192.5,"local_amount":2300,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2322.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512393}],"funded_date":"2011-01-26T20:06:59Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:11:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":272174,"name":"Stephen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stephen is a 47-year-old married man, with six children living in an owned house in Fort Portal, Uganda.

Her past loans have been used for many things for the house and for the education of her eldest daughter who just graduated with a degree in Hotel and Restaurant Management.\r\n\r\nShe applied for this loan to finish paying off the old tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) from her previous loan and to make a partial payment on a brand new motorcycle. She hopes that in the future she will be able to save enough money to expand her business and build a better house.

She is 48 years old, single with a 15-year-old son who studies in the school of Santa Ana (T\u00e9cnico Daniel Ermida). She lives in her parents' house as she was the oldest daughter of five who stayed with them till their death. She keeps animals such as milking cows, pigs, chickens, guinea pigs, and hens which she sells whenever there is an opportunity.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is an informal vendor at the markets of the town of Cuenca. She sells vegetables, fruits and whatever can be sold from Monday through Saturday from approximately 7 am to 5 pm, depending on sales. After work she takes care of her animals and on week-ends she sells cattle, which she has bought and raised for three-four months, at different markets or from home. At the present she is worried about  the disease attacking the animals (foot and mouth disease) which makes business difficult. Mar\u00eda Rosa has been a partner of \"Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir\" for approximately 3 years, and is requesting a loan of US$440 to buy fertilizers for her land as well as a young bull for a yoke as the sowing season is getting close.

She is married to Marzan, a painter, and is the mother of a child currently enrolled in elementary school. At this time, she is working hard to be able to support her child\u2019s schooling all the way through college. This is the dream of most Filipino parents like Jo-Ane, as she herself is a college graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave their children. Jo-Ane is a licensed nurse.\r\n<p>\r\nJo-Ane maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 13,000 in sales every month. Jo-Ane also incorporates frozen cuts of meat and native meat delicacies to her current business inventory. She offers sweetened hams, pork sausages and cured beef.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 29,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Jo-Ane has been a member of Center for Community Transformation for four years now and regularly attends fellowship meetings.* \r\n<p>\r\nJo-Ane dreams to be able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She hopes to see her child receive his own college diploma.\r\n<p>\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Sometimes he has to sleep in his kiosk, accompanied by his wife and his youngest son while his other children stay at home. \r\n\r\nThe income from selling fish is not much. The average of his daily income is about IDR 50,000. This income is not sufficient for Isai to meet the needs of his family, as he still needs to pay the school fees of his children. Therefore, Isai has tried to find other ways to increase his income by selling grilled fish. In order to do so, Isai needs capital assistance to buy the equipment to grill fish. In addition, he will also need to buy a variety of fish to grill. Isai is requesting a loan of IDR 4,500,000 from TLM. He hopes the application will be approved so he can improve his

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She was  able to gradually expand her retail store and her husband's farm was also able to earn additional income, which they used to build a separate shed for her retail shop. She is now very excited to get another loan  to expand the inventory of her retail shop. With the two growing businesses she hopes that she will be able to set aside enough savings for her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":31127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock for her retail store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"WS","country":"Samoa","town":"Saanapu Tai","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.583333 -172.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":15,"posted_date":"2007-05-30T01:38:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ofu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-13T17:04:39Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-08-14T09:16:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":42510},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-09-14T09:16:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":54376},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-10-14T09:17:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":67143},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-11-14T10:16:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":81234},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-12-14T10:17:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96841},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-01-14T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":115380},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-02-14T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":135031},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-03-14T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":157501},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-04-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182069},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-05-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":209550},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-06-14T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":237579},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2008-07-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":266506}],"funded_date":"2007-05-30T17:04:39Z","paid_date":"2008-07-14T09:02:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":13230,"name":"Ninfa","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Ninfa  R.

He is a farmer in Ahovil\u00e8kom\u00e8 village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and he is a member of the Houedome group GH AYIDOTE MINAWANOU. The inhabitants of this village farm the land after the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river drops. Their lands are rich and highly productive. Their main business activities involve growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these river valley dwellers is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and they spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. At low water they don\u2019t have any money left to pay the workforce that is essential for sowing the land available to them. The local practice of selling off the harvested crops does not provide them with security, moreover, it bankrupts them. This practice involves selling the future harvest at a rock-bottom price to an affluent person to get hold of the money required to carry out the farming. Tired of this practice, they have asked for a loan of 100,000 FCFA ($200) to farm about one hectare of the aforementioned land.\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent,

His primary job is to provide adequate care to his fields.  For the past ten years, he has enjoyed developing his crops of bananas, coffee, citrus fruits, and other products that are native to the area.  Clearing his fields is difficult work, which explains why he does not like removing brush and pulling weeds.  Doing this type of work every day makes his arms sore.  Juan prefers to plant and harvest, as well as utilize the farming techniques that his father taught him.  Later on he hopes to continue growing coffee and bananas since these products are in high demand at the market.  In addition, he wants to build his own house and establish a business selling groceries.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the second time he has received a loan from MFP.  From the start, Juan has worked as an active member of his Communal Bank with the other members.  The loan he requested will be used to buy dozens of coffee plants and several sacks of compost for fertilizing his crops.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":568622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase coffee plants & sacks of compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2045.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195457}],"funded_date":"2010-08-03T19:01:15Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":218934,"name":"Sergio Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sergio Alberto de 64 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene 5 hijos y todos trabajan de manera independiente.
