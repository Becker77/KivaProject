She lives in Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. Through these two businesses, she is gradually making her family economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP 10,000. \r\n\r\nMarites is borrowing PHP 11,000 to fund operations of her business venture. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Marites aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Working six days a week and nine hours a day, he earns about 1,200,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL.

Since she was twelve, she never missed the fairs of her city as this is where she earns her living selling all types of condiments in small bags to the local housewives.  This activity helps her meet her living expenses, since she sells every week, and she enjoys offering her products although it would be more practical to have a stable location from which to sell her merchandise.  But, thanks to God she tells us, sales of condiments are always good because not many people offer them.  In addition, they are inexpensive and selling them at retail is profitable.  Regardless, it is difficult to walk constantly and be exposed to the sun all day.  This is her first loan with MFP.  With the funds she is requesting, she will increase her supply of products.

This is 29 year old Zuwena J. from Mwanza. She is married with two children, between the ages of 3 and 11 years old. Zuwena has been running a Mobile phone accessories business since 2005. It is amazing how many people have mobile phones in Tanzania. This is probably attributable to the fact that it is the only form of phone communication available to most people, because there are few landlines, and followed closely by how relatively cheap mobile phones are here. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, days per week. Zuwena currently earns about 150USD from her business.

She lacks the money to pay for her children\u2019s education.  With the help of her grown children, she hopes to increase the volume of crops that are planted.  When it comes to marketing her products, Basilia is an astute saleswoman because the consumers in Tarma are very knowledgeable.

She enjoys sales because she likes speaking with her customers and offering them her products.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.

Salima is a small entrepreneur from Dushanbe, Tajikistan. She is married with 4 children, who are the reason for her daily fight for a better life. Being the only bread winner in the family she sells women national dresses and trousers in the famous local market called \u201cKorvon\u201d. Salima is a very hard-working woman. She always achieves all her goals and overcomes different challenges with natural optimism. She is requesting a loan of $825 USD to re-stock her inventory. She is hoping to purchase more merchandise at affordable wholesale prices for further retail sale. The only dream of Salima is to ensure her children with a good education and to make them happy. We believe Salima\u2019s integrity and the consistent growth of her venture in the past years can guarantee further stable expansion of her trade and timely loan repayment. The well being of this family is on your hands. \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his wife and three little children (son pictured) in the northern section of the city where the pollution is the worst. He purchased an insulated ger (traditional nomadic tent) blanket in order to help reduce the air pollution. So far, he is really happy with the ger insulation and feels that he is saving money from spending less on fuel and is keeping warmer than before.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank Eco Products Program:\r\nUlaanbaatar is the coldest capital in the world. Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. Sixty percent of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts.

For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

Even though she is financially unable to consistently combat poverty and the challenge to supporting her family, Sampaguita has never seen a life happier than hers since her family supports one another through thick and thin. \r\n\r\nHer husband works hard in the field farming rice as a hired laborer. His small and sporadic income is remitted to Sampaguita, being the one in charge of the family budget. A large portion of it goes for the education of her two children in high school.  \r\n\r\nSampaguita really wants her children to graduate from college and have a better career in the future. She was frustrated when her eldest child stopped schooling after elementary. However, she had no choice then because she didn\u2019t have enough income to support her education. With that, Sampaguita learned a lesson. She realized she has to have her own business and supplement the income of her husband. \r\n\r\nThis realization led her to ASHI in 2002. Since then she has been receiving loans and has able to put up her own small \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store, selling a small volume of various grocery items, foodstuffs, beverages and other commodities. People would tend to buy things they need from her than going to market and spending carfare. Therefore, Samapguita\u2019s store has acquired a lot of customers from around their village. \r\n\r\nProceeds from this business have somehow made life easy and enjoyable for her family, especially her children. Because she sees the potential of improving their standard of living once her business has grown, as well as its profit, Sampaguita is applying for a much larger  loan amount from ASHI. Her husband supports her decision for this because he sees his wife enjoying her career running her own business.

form a committee in their neighbourhood. They are very happy with the opportunity to organize themselves and progress in a communal manner.\r\nThey are requesting a loan which they will invest in the purchase of items that will be sold in their respective commercial activities.

She helps support her family by operating a direct selling business as a Natasha Dealer.  She lives in Madasigon, Barangay Balidbid, Santa Fe, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $163. \r\n\r\nMarinel is now borrowing 15,000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 3rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 7,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Marinel aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

After the death of his mother, Turatbek moved into his parents\u2019 house in order to take care of his father. Since his family had been engaged in cattle breeding and land cultivating, he decided to continue this activity.  He worked hard, but his earnings did not cover all the expenses for his growing children.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Turatbek decided to start his business selling foodstuffs.  This has become an additional source of income for his family.  He sold part of his cattle business and rented a small shop.  To maintain that shop, he obtained his first loan from Bai Tushum.

27-year-old man. He lives in the city of Pucallpa with his wife whom he loves, and he is grateful for all her support. He is a very kind, hardworking, and enthusiastic person who has a great desire to improve himself. Unfortunately, because of a lack of financial resources and the need to work, Reyder was unable to study to become a police officer, but he would have liked to have done so very much. In his spare time, he likes to cook a rich Tacacho to enjoy with his family. \r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, with a lot of resolve and dedication, Reyder works as a security agent for a company in his city. He works every day from the early hours of the morning and can work for approximately 8 hours. He feels comfortable doing his job and he believes that it is going well due to his responsibility and good performance. \r\n\r\nReyder is very grateful for the Kiva lenders, since thanks to the provided assistance, he will be able to buy lumber, tubing, and other construction materials which will greatly help him to construct a small bathroom in his home. This way, he and his family will be able to have a basic hygienic bathroom, improving their health and hygiene. Therefore, Reyder will continue working and making an effort to get ahead and to achieve his greatest dream of having his own commercial business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1278595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy construction materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyder","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":49.98},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":52.11},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":51.74},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":53.9},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":57.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":58.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":62.47},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":64.15},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":66.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":68.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.62},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.21},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeremy Orloski","image":null}},{"id":1362,"name":"Lourdes Yanette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"My name is Lourdes Yannette.

She sells cheese and potatoes, which she distributes to stores to sell.  She collects the money after her products are sold.  She has been doing this for 6 years and this pays for a large part of her household expenses.  Maria doesn't consider her job to be complicated, rather it is very peaceful.  She takes her products to the stores every 15 days.  What she likes best about her job is making delicious cheeses and this is profitable because she is the only person who supplies the stores in her region with these products.

He lives with his partner and three children in a house that he built out of wood. Since he was young, Aldo's father has been confident in his son's farming work, given that he demonstrates responsibility in all of his tasks. Now that he is the head of his own family, Aldo works eagerly on each of his crops. He works even harder as a day laborer, where he earns 15 soles per day, which he uses to cover household expenses while he waits for his fields to bear fruit. In this way Aldo's harvests produce very good earnings. \r\n\r\nThroughout these years Aldo has accumulated experience in the proper management of each crop, and as a result he is happy with his work. Thanks to his efforts he'd like to incrementally increase his lands, with the desire to plant more so that when his children grow up he can provide for them. He'd like his children to attend University. \r\n\r\nIn previous loan cycles Aldo's wife was the title holder in the community bank, but because Aldo is very active his colleagues have asked him to be the title holder in this cycle. As such, he'll attend monthly meetings with the group. The money will be invested in nitrate fertilizer to fertilize his coffee plans and have a good harvest.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":337969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-19T15:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2028.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992340}],"funded_date":"2009-06-19T19:54:51Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Bishop","image":107465}},{"id":120170,"name":"Awusi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Awusi is 48 years old.

For more than a year and a half she has run a store where she sells basic products such as sugar, oil, salt, eggs, soft drinks and candy. She also sells tortillas. She is very dynamic and hard-working and because of this she is well-known in her neighbourhood. This is helpful, since her customers know where to find her. She is trying to expand her business, and when her customers request new items she tries to get them to satisfy her customers. For example, she also sells gifts for different occasions as they are requested. She has demonstrated herself to be a very responsible woman, as she has been very punctual with her payments during her time with FAPE. She says she is very happy because she has many plans that she wants to achieve, so she is requesting this loan to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nMaria Eduarda Garcia, another group member, sells tortillas, eggs, sausages, spicy pork sausages, tomatoes and other products that her customers request. She has five children and tells us how she is working hard to expand her business in order to, along with her husband, offer her children an education; they all go to school. She has always been an enterprising and responsible woman, as she always says that she has to make a good name for herself because it is an example for her children.\r\n\r\nBeronica T. is the third group member.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.\r\n\r\nThese loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans to give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":584627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives in Prk. Mahogany, Brgy Magsaysay, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard at her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $95. Teresita is now borrowing 19,000 PHP so that she can purchase more inventory to sell in her general store and at the same time to fully pay the balance on her motorcycle with sidecar that shuttles passengers in their area for a fee. This will be her 7th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 16,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Teresita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Tayawan, Bayawan, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a  piggery and a sugar cane farming businesses. Her husband Rosalito C., who is 38 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 5 to 17 years old. \r\n\r\nMaribeth joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maribeth has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children. Maribeth C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating one business venture: buying and selling religious articles.  Her husband Leopoldo P., who is 55 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 19 to 29 years old with 3 of their children having their own family while the youngest one is currently going to school. \r\n\r\nVioleta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Violeta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future and cover their family's needs. \r\n\r\nVioleta P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married to Eufemio, her business partner, and mother to her children. She, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nFelicitas operates a variety store. In the Philippines a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php1,000 in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nFelicitas hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":866110,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T00:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":16667,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":16915.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764624},{"amount":400,"local_amount":16666,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":16914.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571745},{"amount":320,"local_amount":13334,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":13533.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529295},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3382.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738515}],"funded_date":"2011-09-15T20:18:27Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Natalie Eslick","image":1085366}},{"id":338208,"name":"Yolanda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yolanda is 58 years old and lives in Fatima, Liloy, Zamboanga del Norte.

She has had this business for ten years.  Before, she had a place where she took care of customers.  But, as she is now pregnant, she cannot work as much as before.  The pregnancy has given her a bit of depression, and she has to rest.  Therefore, she has decided to close her place for a while and work from house to house for a while.  This way she will save on the rent of her local, but she will still keep her customer base.\r\n\r\nJenny has asked for a $550 loan, which she will use to pay her daughter\u2019s school and pay the rent for her house (she rents from her mother).  Her ex husband should pay for their daughter\u2019s education.  But, he is a little behind in paying support, so it falls to Jenny to pay it. \r\n\r\nJenny\u2019s future goal is to buy a small piece of land where she can build her own house.\r\n\r\nShe has been getting loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir for one year.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started with a small amount of money, 5000 som (KGS) and now her business yields a profit of 5000 som every two months. In order to further expand her herd Jydyzkan has turned to \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) so that she can purchase more cattle.

This group is located in a sugar-cane producing region with a warm climate, as this community has developed in the foothills\r\n\r\nBety is one of the  members of this group.  She is 49 years old, and has a business degree.  She is the single mother of 3 children, but now only one of them is dependent upon her - the youngest, 13, who is named Jose Carlos and is in middle school.  \r\n\r\nBety says that she has always had to work in order to provide for her children and give them an education.  She started out selling items for the home (dishes, pots,  glasses, plates and containers) to her friends and neighbors in the community, but as the years went by her children grew and their expenses increased and she had to find a way to increase her income.  So, as she was a very good cook, she decided to start selling Mexican snacks and fast food from her home, and at times she also delivers them to people's homes.  She said \"I've already been selling household items for 6 years and selling food for 3, and thanks to God I have my customers, and so gradually we are seeking a way to get ahead.\"  Bety needs this loan to invest in the purchase of chilies, tomatoes, onions, meat, cream, cheese, rice, beans, and a variety of fruits and vegetables to make her food, and also to buy some household products.  She hopes that with this investment her business will continue to make progress, since she plans in the future to establish a small restaurant. \r\n\r\nThe members of this group are grateful to the Fundacion for the support that they are getting in the form of these loans for their businesses so that their quality of life can improve.

It enjoyed great fame in the years around 1900 due to its mineral wealth, which made it worthy of its name.<br \/><br \/>A mountainous tourist destination with noticeable English and French influences whose three main streets shine like a European villa. A carnival is celebrated during Holy Week, amidst the \"Fiestas de El Oro.\" This party is made up of a parade that runs through the main streets of town, displaying floats and costumes, horseback riding, horse races, and other popular spectacles captivate the town. <br \/><br \/>In the town center the locals of El Oro offer crafts of all kinds, including ceramic, baked clay, woven wool cloths, handmade gold items, local liquors like \"Chiva\", and colonial-era furniture, amongst others. The town is also well-known for a carriage that functions now as a restaurant.<br \/><br \/>Reme states: \"That wagon was just a train car that was left there but now functions as a restaurant. People know it very well; the best that is offered are the delicious coffees.\"<br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Remedios, or as she is affectionately know, Reme, is a hard-working woman.  Always upbeat, she has always had a great entrepreneurial spirit. She is very dedicated to her home.  She is 48 years old and has been married to her husband for 27 years.  Together they have formed a family with three children, one of whom is still studying in high school.<br \/><br \/>Reme works making school uniforms and has done so for the last 25 years.  \"At first I was employed by someone that also worked making school uniforms.  That is how I learned. Then I taught my husband and now he knows more than me. We started with just one simple machine and we only made small dresses for girls,\" Reme recalls. Bit by bit her sewing shop grew thanks to the loans of another financing agency. After a long time working with that lender she learned about VFMexico and Kiva and decided to change. She is now requesting a loan to buy fabric, thread, elastic bands, and socks.  She will also use her loan to repair and maintain her sewing machines.  <br \/><br \/>She works making uniforms but usually only for orders that the town schools submit, as well as neighboring communities.  Besides her special clients, she has an employee that helps her with the fulfillment of all these orders.  She buys her materials in Mexico City as often as she needs, usually every 15 days or monthly. <br \/><br \/>It seems she does not face any roadblocks; her only goal is to grow her business in order to continue paying her bills.  Although her children may not finish school and it is her greatest wish that they can do so, now she has a family business where they can all work with no problem. <br \/><br \/>The members of the group are Natividad Maria de Jes\u00fas, who sells underwear, Ruperto who sells groceries, Guadalupe who invests in carpentry, Leticia in clothes and Jonathan in screen printing. <br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken in Reme's business.

She receives more than a hundred tala (US$30) a day for running this business.  She is confident about doing everything that will improve her business.  She will use her loan to buy things that she needs (e.g. more products to sell and equipment she needs for her business).

She initially began by informally running her business out of a room of her house, and later moved to the market and began to show her merchandise in a small hut made of wood with a black plastic roof.  With the inclement sun in the city of Leon (one of the hottest cities in Nicaragua,) she began to invest in the purchase of the small bulk packages of clothing.  Thanks to God (she said herself,) the sales went well enough at first.  She had little competition, an inexpensive product, a good location, etc.  <p>The competition increased later on, however, which made things more difficult despite her efforts and sacrifice.  Mrs. A. managed to make gradual improvements to her small sales stand, changing the plastic roofing for Zinc to protect her merchandise from the rain.  In order to offer better service for her customers, she expanded her space for sales and with some loans she made provisions for her business, little by little.  There are still many aspects to improve, however, if we review her business history, the improvement is obvious.  Mrs. Karla has 2 children, both are school-aged and studying.  Her husband works as an electrician, but it is not a stable job which is why Mrs. Karla's business is the primary source of income for her family.\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Laura Kirkvold, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEsta se\u00f1ora posee un modesto puesto de venta de ropa usada americana (conocida en Nicaragua como pacas) desde hace poco m\u00e1s de 12 a\u00f1os, el cual inici\u00f3 con aproximadamente US$ 105 d\u00f3lares y la compra de una peque\u00f1a paca (paquete de ropa usada), de manera informal en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n, luego se traslada al mercado y empieza a exhibir su mercader\u00eda en una peque\u00f1a caseta hecha de madera y con el techo construido con pl\u00e1stico negro, con el inclemente sol de la ciudad de Le\u00f3n (una de las ciudades m\u00e1s calientes de Nicaragua) en ese momento invert\u00eda en la compra de dos peque\u00f1os paquetes, gracias a Dios (expresa ella misma) la venta le fue bastante bien al principio, poca competencia, un producto barato, buena ubicaci\u00f3n, etc. <p>\r\nSin embargo, luego que la competencia aument\u00f3 las cosas se hicieron m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles, a pesar de esto producto del esfuerzo y sacrificio por sobrevivir, la se\u00f1ora A. logr\u00f3 ir haciendo mejoras paulatinas a su peque\u00f1o puesto de ventas, cambi\u00f3 el techo de pl\u00e1stico por zinc, sobre todo para proteger la mercader\u00eda de la lluvia y ofrecer un mejor servicio, ampli\u00f3 el espacio de venta y con varios cr\u00e9ditos fue surtiendo poco a poco su negocio.

She specializes in women\u2019s skirts.  Each week she travels to Kampala and, one by one, she chooses skirts to sell in her shop.  She can buy a skirt at about 2,000 USH and she can resell it at about 3,500 USH.  Usually she sells her skirts at the local market where she pays 500 USH rent per day.  Annet has been in this business for about 10 years now.  She works alone at her location, but her husband has a different stall at the market.  The work that she and her husband do, supports their four children. Since their children range from ages 17 to 5, they are all currently in school.  This means there is a heavy burden for the parents to carry. Annet says that although she could still be in the skirt-selling business without loans, the loans allow her to reduce her expenses. When she uses loans she is able to buy more skirts when she goes to Kampala.  This gives her more selection and reduces transport costs. In this loan cycle, Annet is requesting a loan of 300,000 to purchase a large stock of skirts.

The stability of her business allows her to make a considerable contribution to the family income. This is her third loan with Kiva partner IMON International.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Life around the city can be difficult, with little access to reliable electricity and running water. It is also crowded and polluted, with insufficient sanitation. Despite any difficulties she may face, Benita runs a successful shop from her home selling clothes. She plans to use this loan, her very first from Esperanza International, to purchase both new and used blouses, shirts, and pants for women and men. She will then sell the clothes to her friends and neighbors at a small markup.\r\n\r\nBenita is very grateful for her newfound access to financial services such as loans and savings, as well as health services for her family. She hopes to continue expanding her business, and she hopes to own her own shop one day. Benita has four children, from twelve to eighteen years old, and she also hopes to send them all to university with the extra profits from her business.

P. lives in the Los Almendros neighborhood in the town of Soledad, which is located south of Barranquilla.  She has a store called \u201cDonde Patty\u201d where she sells foods, meats, soft drinks, sweets, and other miscellaneous general goods.  She is married and has 4 children who range in age from 8 to 26.  Even though this is Patricia\u2019s first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, she already knows that it is both important and useful to invest the loan in her business; Patricia's husband has a very good credit history, and she now wants to start building her own credit history.  She is going to use this loan of 2,300,000 Colombian pesos to purchase two tables and chairs, and to stock her business with beverages and foods such as rice and sugar in large quantities.\r\n\r\nPatricia comes from Piedecuesta, a town in the department of Santander in the country\u2019s interior.  This is panela country (an area that produces panela, which is basically a loaf of unrefined sugar), where, as Patricia says, you can meet people who are very hardworking and innovative who \u201cput our shoulders toward the sun.\u201d\r\n\r\nPatricia worked in restaurants until her husband proposed to her\u2014she then left her job and the two of them borrowed some money so that they could set up a store in Piedecuesta.  Her husband also worked as a telephone network and Internet maintenance technician, though that was not going so well since he only occasionally got contracts.  In 2001 an important company hired Patricia\u2019s husband, and he suggested that they move to Barranquilla; they thus sold their store in Santander and purchased a house in Soledad, which is where their new store is located.  Patricia\u2019s most important challenge is making some adjustments to her business so that she can expand it and be able to offer services to families who shop at her store.  Overcoming this challenge will allow her to fulfill her dream of paying for her house through her own hard work, which will in turn help her to live a stable life and have good health.\r\n<br

She is married and has one school-aged child.  To make a living, Fuaifatu owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector growing crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting taamu for sale.  Fuaifatu has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 800 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fuaifatu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Fuaifatu has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1000 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  Fuaifatu is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Fuaifatu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to the borrower's house.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":928640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Some years ago, she and her husband worked in everything involved with sales and repair of cars, but 11 months ago they decided to rent a locale independently. This small space has been giving fruits, since their hard work and the quality of their service has increased their clientele day by day. By the side of her husband, Sonia works as a team; her husband works on auto repair and she works on selling spare parts. In this way they manage to have a solid income that enhances the quality of life of their little ones. She is very happy and wishes to some day be able to own her own house, since right now they live in the same shop where they offer their services so they can cut on costs and consolidate their business. Part of the project they have started includes buying more merchandise to allow them greater sales, and so she is requesting a loan of US $ 375.

Furthermore, she always keeps her store well-stocked with a variety of products. She usually works on her own, but her children occasionally help her. Her day starts at 5 am and lasts until 9 pm.

Ni\u00f1o, Tukuran Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 50 years old and married with one adult child. To make a living, Evangeline operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as milk, coffee, sardines, soft drinks, shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Evangeline has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Evangeline joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Evangeline is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP to invest in expanding her business. This will be her first loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC: GDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

Obo, Dalaguete, Cebu.  She earns her living by operating one business venture: buying and selling vegetables. Her husband Maximiano R., who is 49 years old, works as a motorcycle driver (\"habal-habal\") to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are 10 to 23 years old.  \r\n\r\nRestituta  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Restituta  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use as additional business capital so that she can continue to save up for the future of her children.  \r\n\r\nRestituta  R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Rochelle D. C. knows this truth and grabs opportunity as it comes her way. Rochelle, 32, is a single mother of one child who is in elementary school. After finishing high school, Rochelle strived more to sustain their daily needs and to prepare financially for the future of her young child. The family lives in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nRochelle runs a sari-sari (variety) store, where she sells items that are needed daily by her neighbors. Products on her shelves range from bars of soap  to candy and energy drinks to rice.  She also manages a food stall where she sells foodstuffs to neighbors. After 18 years in business, Rochelle knows how to pay her dues. She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in CCT and, most important, with her customers. She earns an average of 10,000 Philippines pesos (Php) per month.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php11,000 loan. She intends to use this money to replenish the inventory of her store for the Christmas season and to purchase raw meat and other ingredients needed for her food vending business.  Rochelle plans to take this opportunity to drive her businesses toward more profitability.  \r\n\r\nRochelle's life is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He is an electrician and used to work at the local power plant.  Unfortunately, his salary was not sufficient to cover his family's expenses, and Khabibulla decided to start his own business of reselling seeds.
