All of them are studying. \r\n\r\nTo meet the daily needs of the growing family, the couple work hand in hand through all means just to earn a living. Both are engaged in making & selling doormats and at the same time her husband maintains their small vegetable plantation. Margie wishes to increase their income so that she can start earning for her children\u2019s future. She applies for a loan of Php 24,000 to fund their plan to expand their vegetable (Kangkong) plantation. It\u2019s been three years since the couple got into this business and they have realized that profit is good because vegetables are in demand with Filipinos.  They want to purchase raw materials such as bamboo poles, straw and construct 5 rafts that they will use to gather said vegetable. They are expecting P 10,000 additional monthly profit from this business.  \r\n\r\nThe couple's dream is to be able to establish a good business and increase their profit so that they can renovate their house, provide for their daily needs and send their children to a nice school. Margie also wishes to help people in their community by hiring them during harvest time on their plantation and in production of doormats. \r\n\r\nShe wishes that people from ASHI and KIVA partners will help them achieve this plan. The couple also wishes to convey their sincere gratitude to both institutions for providing capital to poor families without collateral and encouraging people like them to bring out their skills and potentials so as to be able to rise from poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":589977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"raw

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: buying and selling coconuts and brooms. Her husband Harry, who is 30 years old, works as a merchandiser to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is five years old. Jonah joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jonah has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 1,500 after paying all loans and less expense, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital to continue to save up for future house repairs and business expansion. Jonah is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He works with a wide variety of patients, such as people suffering from muscle-skeletal diseases like Parkinson\u2019s and muscular dystrophy, as well as people recovering from injuries sustained in severe accidents. He also helps people suffering from occupationally-induced pain and general wear and tear. In addition to using massage therapy to alleviate patients\u2019 pain, David gets to the root of the problem by teaching them therapeutic exercises that help cure the underlying issues causing the pain. For example, he helps patients correct their gait and posture to avoid further joint or ligament damage, and works with them on increasing muscle strength around areas of injury or irritation.\r\n\r\nDavid says that even as a small child, he had the ability to ease pain. He describes it as having a natural \u201ctherapeutic touch\u201d that people\u2019s bodies respond to. Growing up, he would massage relatives complaining of pain as well as injured pets. Before deciding to start his own business in 1996, David had attained his license and worked with a chiropractor for four years. David says that his decision to start his own business came from him wanting to challenge himself personally and find his own path.  \r\n\r\nDavid is using this loan to buy tables and chairs for his business, as well as to increase his marketing efforts. Until now, he has advertised through fliers and networking. He collaborates with another massage therapist in leading seminars that educate people about the benefits of natural healing. He also visits many businesses in the greater-El Paso area to let people know of his services.  \r\n\r\n\u201cAt some point, all of us will need some kind of hands-on work,\u201d David explains. Though David likes marketing his business on a personal level, he recognizes its limitations and feels the need to move into media with a larger impact. \u201cEvery day I reach out to individuals,\u201d David explains, \u201cbut with the internet I want to reach out to more groups.\u201d He is currently in the process of building a website and is also developing educational CDs

Married and mother of five (5) children, she has owned a shoe selling business for the last 5 years. On top of this business, she also does some subsistance farming. The farming is becoming more and more difficult, so she has decided to devote her time entirely to the shoe selling business, which is much more profitable. She wants to diversify her range of products by adding handbags and belts. Despite the fact she doesn\u2019t have a lot of education, she has mastered the concepts of management. She has already paid back her first loan without any incident. Today, to strenghten her business, she is asking for another loan, of $650. She will use the money as business capital to buy and sell shoes, handbags and belts. This will allow her to satisfy the demands of her clients and increase her income, allowing her to improve the standard of living of her family.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Susan Bell, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMadame N.

After getting married, she continued with her sewing business, but due to lack of money the income from her sewing business was not regular. In 2000 she joined the fund after discussing with her husband in order to borrow money to purchase fabrics. With the loan, she was able to  buy a lot of fabrics, and combined with her experience, her business expanded bringing in more customers. In addition to rice farming, her husband also does carpentry\/construction work, and makes average of 120 USD per month, which makes their family income more stable.

She's the mother of 3 dependent children, whom she would like to support until they're professionals in their own right. She and her husband, Amilcar, who is a carpenter, work very hard to make sure their children prosper. Casilda's wish is to better her business environment by enlarging the store, setting it up, and subsequently, refurbishing some parts of the rooms she rents.

She also finds time to raise pigs. Alice lives in Nkwen where she sells her clothing. She will use her loan to purchase clothing to resell at the market and to buy piglets to raise. \r\n \r\nThis is Alice\u2019s sixth loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2002. Her clothing business has been running since at least then and she knows her customer base well. She plans on changing locations with this new loan and understands what it takes to sell her clothes in a different market. \r\n\r\nHer past loans have gone into her clothing business. The profits from those loans have helped her buy textbooks for her children\u2019s education, as well as to pay for the farm\u2019s rent. This particular loan will help her to rent a new farm and buy fertilizer for it, as well as continue to fund her children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nAlice has not had it easy living in poverty. Both she and, at times, her children have had to go without enough clothing.  She has also had to experience the death of her brother and sister. Alice stands strong, however, with her clothing business. She prefers to use GHAPE because the loan conditions work well for her. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":285707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 125 tala or US $52 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nele  joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Nele 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Nele  S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He is 41 years old. Jimmy is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJimmy is married and has 2 school-aged children. He owns and operates a motorcycle transport business. The main source of income for the business comes from operating a tricycle transport service. Jimmy has been involved in his business for over 9 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Jimmy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jimmy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to repair an existing vehicle for better service. Jimmy is requesting a new loan, his eighth, for 11,000 PHP, which will be used to help purchase a new motorcycle unit. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Gafur grows different kinds of vegetables and raises cattle. He is 55 years old and has 5 children. Before this, he worked as a driver. Gafur was not happy with his previous job because he received little compensation for his work. So he went back to his village and decided to manage his small farm. In the year 1997 Gafur started managing his farming and cattle raising business. He uses his harvest to buy the things his family needs and to help send his children to school. Gafur is asking for a loan of $2000 USD. He will use the loan to buy seeds, fertilizer and cattle.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is separated. Every day she works hard to come out ahead. For the past 3 years, this enterprising woman has had a convenience store installed in her home from where she sells food items, soft drinks, and beer. She is very happy with her work because it is at a comfortable pace and she is able to maintain her home at the same time. It is a constant source of income that grants her the ability to give her kids a good quality of life. She has several regular clients who purchase drinks from her, especially because they live in a remote community of very warm climate. She has a steady source of income, especially during the weekends. This is how Onorina spends her days, caring for her kids and managing her store. And because she is very enterprising she has planned to improve and expand the store in the future. She endeavors to keep up the progress.

They all work hard to support their families. The following paragraphs detail the different businesses activities of each member:\r\n\r\nGumercina Gonz\u00e1les Su\u00e1rez owns a mill for grinding maize. The maize flour is used to make tortillas, rosquillas (ring-shaped pastries), and nacatamales (steamed meat and vegetable-filled tamales wrapped in maize or banana leaf). She has many loyal customers because of the good customer service she provides. With the profit earned from her business, Gumercina helps her husband pay for household expenses. The couple have a beautiful daughter together. This loan will be used to purchase spare parts to maintain the mill.\r\n\r\nMaria Victorina B. is a small retailer, selling cosmetics, new and used clothing, and silver jewelry. She sells most of her products on Saturdays and Sundays, when she collects money from customers who have purchased items on credit. Maria takes advantage of the weekends to make additional sales. With her business income she pays for household expenses. Maria is a single mother and has to work very hard to take care of her family. This loan will be used to purchase merchandise so that she can stock a better selection and meet the demands of her customers.\r\n\r\nElvin Oswaldo A. L. buys and sells staple grains. He buys during the harvest when the price is low and later retails the grain at a higher price. With his business profit he pays for household expenses. His wife works in a cigarette factory, which allows her to earn enough money to improve the family's living conditions. The loan will be used to buy grains because the local price is currently very low and this will give Elvin a better profit margin.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":734746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase spare parts for mill, clothing, cosmetics, silver jewelry, beans, maize, and rice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2011-04-07T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gumercinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Victorina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvin Oswaldo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211295767},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216575676},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221745388},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-20T08:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227718386},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232876629},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:19:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238693316},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244649316},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-20T09:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251598442}],"funded_date":"2011-04-10T19:55:53Z","paid_date":"2012-01-20T09:07:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":287569,"name":"Arzygul's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arzygul S., 25, is the leader of this group and resides in Nookat.

one who values dreams like gold, every effort is necessary. Josephine J., 45, exerts the best effort she can give to attain her dreams for her business and for her family. Josephine reached second year in college and is now married to Johnimar, a goldsmith. Together they live in Dasmarinas, Cavite.\r\n\r\nJosephine helps Johnimar in marketing the gold jewelry he makes. Their shop, which has been operating for 11 years now, is located on a nearby barangay in Cavite. Josephine hires four employees to help with the making of gold accessories and other items. Also, she sells products ranging from clothes to small house appliances directly to customers she knows in her community. Another source of income for their family is selling electronic loads for mobile phones. With these small-scale businesses, Josephine is able to earn around PHP 12,500 on average monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her goldsmith shop, Josephine is requesting a 38,000 PHP loan. In keeping with her learning from the lessons CCT gives on entrepreneurship, Josephine will use this loan to pay for materials necessary in making gold jewelry. Josephine sees this as a big help to her capital, which will eventually impact her business income greatly.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there are a lot of challenges every micro entrepreneur faces every day, but Josephine chooses to focus on her golden dreams. It is her desire for her business to become famous in their place and eventually gain more branches in other towns. \r\n\r\nFor her family, she prays to have their own dream house in time. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":753771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to

is a group loan to be shared by the nine women of the Djouromfouk-Houssel group, led by Ms. Aima S..  \r\n\r\nThis group sells things like cashew wine (very popular in this region), palm oil, and dried fish. They buy big quantities of these products in Ziguinchor cities and resell them here in M\u2019Lomp and surrounding villages at a mark-up.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe group had a previous tontine, or a type of social security system where the various group members contribute a fixed amount of money to a pooled account in case of emergency. This same group decided to take a SEM loan to support their various business endeavors. The skills learned in a tontine can be very useful in a group loan situation, as both rely heavily on group decision-making, group governance and management of money. With almost no social systems to look out for the elderly, this type of group cohesion is extremely beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it comes time to spend the profits in the pooled account, the group will have a group meeting. Money from their past business activities has been spent on such things as: buying seeds for the garden, buying material to tend to the garden, building a well, and cost associated with illness. \r\n\r\nThis is the group's second Kiva loan.   To learn more, see Djouroumfouk-Houssel's previous Kiva business page at  http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=707.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

She travels to the Dominican Republic capital of Santo Domingo to purchase the shoes, shirts, blouses and skirts she sells in her area.  A new highway finished recently has given Wanda the ability to travel to Santo Domingo in just two and a half hours, whereas before, the trip took over five hours.

A new university campus is opening in Saman\u00e1, and Wanda is going to start taking classes in marketing next month.

She lives with her husband and children in their own house. All her life she has been tied to the activities of the countryside. She works with her husband every day beginning in the early morning hours, when she takes their animals to graze in the meadows. At the same time, she raises olluco (a tuberous vegetable), potatoes, beans, and barley; her children help her with this activity. She states that over the years they have overcome difficulties such as frost. Once she has harvested her crops, she takes them to sell directly in the market in her town. In this way she generates the income that she needs. At this time she wants to improve her harvest and increase the number of animals that she has in her stable. This is her seventh loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she has financial support, since she has always demonstrated that she is responsible with her payments. Furthermore, it makes her happy to be part of her community bank, because all its members are responsible and very united people. She is thankful to the people who will be granters of the loan she is applying for, which will be very useful in the progress of her business. With the loan that she is applying for, she will invest in the purchase of seeds and bags of fertilizer to plant potatoes, olluco, and alfalfa, since this last crop is indispensable for feeding her animals.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":598129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy seeds and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-10T02:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saturdina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549409}],"funded_date":"2010-09-10T03:30:02Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":234308,"name":"Ernestine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ernestine is 40 years old.

At first, start-up capital was a major impediment, as Jasper sought to obtain a footing in this lucrative area of business. His drive, discipline, diligence, and desire were strong enough, but the father of one says the savings from his first business - charcoal sales - were minimal. This, to all intents and purposes, rendered it hard for his efforts to take root. The tide turned, however, when a close friend lent him financial assistance for his endeavors, which allowed his food trade sales business to succeed. He now sells his food items in food markets around Bushenyi.\r\n \r\nJasper is a stickler for hard work and he evaluates his strengths and weaknesses on an ongoing basis. He takes pride in the fact that he gets along with people of all different personalities and persuasions. Jasper also ekes out a modest additional income from his small fish sales business.\r\n\r\nHis biggest challenge in the few years he has been in operation is the rising costs of doing business. Rental costs for food stalls in the markets are high. Because most food prices have gone up, recent demand has been plummeting. This has adversely affected Jasper's business. However, Jasper sees a silver lining in all this and chooses to remain upbeat. \r\n\r\nWeekly, Jasper says his business's gross sales revenue totals up to 120,000 Ugandan shillings.\r\n\r\nJasper says this Kiva loan will allow him to purchase more food items to offer for sale, such as maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, yams, Irish potatoes, pineapples, cabbage, and

He is a rice farmer in Baba, Ecuador where he was born and raised. He has had two children, both of whom are grown up and independent. He lives on his farm with his wife and together they make ends meet through rice production. He hopes he can invest the loan by acquiring fertilizers that will help his crops grow better. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":25992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T15:58:49Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esteban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T18:02:50Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1075,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2007-06-16T17:01:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-24T10:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23693},{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T21:40:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-24T10:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33127},{"amount":823,"local_amount":823,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:25:12Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-24T10:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":823,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99069},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-02-23T17:27:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-24T10:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140968}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T18:02:50Z","paid_date":"2008-02-23T17:27:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12232,"name":"Sohor Lorena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>My name is Sohor C. and I sell used clothes.

To this date the store has been able to respond to those needs.\r\n\r\nSo far they have done very well. In almost three years of business, sales have increased; people seek them more because they know they have what they need at an affordable price, and that makes them the favorites in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHe needs a loan for $3000 that he will pay in 6 two-week installments so he can buy a display case to show office supplies, since that is what they need and students seek a lot.

Bulanon, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She is 56 years-old and married to Romeo who is a 59 year-old fisherman. They have ten children whose ages range from 14 to 36 years-old. The older ones have their own jobs and help their parents support the family, while the younger ones still attend school. Purita works hard to help her husband earn additional income to support their family of 12. She dreams that all of her children will finish their studies and have a good job.\r\n<p>\r\nJust like other wives who help their husbands support their family, Purita looked for ways to add on to their capital. In 1998, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could have access to capital so that they could buy additional fishing gear and equipment. Later, she and her husband realized that instead of selling the catch to a local vendor wholesale, they could earn more if Purita sold their catch to the community on a retail basis. This decision turned out to be a good idea as it also enabled them to develop good relationships with their regular customers. Now she earns a minimum of Php 6,000 per month from her business activities.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn her last loan she borrowed Php 19,500 as additional working capital for her fishing business.  After repaying that loan she now wants to borrow the same amount of PhP 19,500 for her 10th cycle loan to be used to purchase a new fishing boat.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

achieving success. Sometimes a staggering success awaits us just some steps ahead and we just have to move a stone which prevents us from seeing the path. Nabat S. is the leader of this group. She is fifty years old. Nabat\u2019s husband works as a security guard. As for Nabat, she offers sewing and tailoring services for local people. Besides this, she has mothered six children: five daughters and a son. Her elder daughters are married and live with their own families. The little daughter is a college student. As for her son, he has gone to Russia in search of work.\r\n\r\nWhether it is being a security guard or a seamstress, these occupations are not among well paid activities. However, years of tireless labor have allowed Nabat to buy a house and a car. Nabat\u2019s sister, who actually taught Nabat sewing, could not imagine that this favor of hers would have provided for Nabat her entire life. Nabat\u2019s monthly income is just $115. Nabat has applied for this loan and hopes to buy fabric for making bed linens and towels as she has secured some large orders. \r\n\r\nNabat\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nParizat C., 45, is a widow. She is engaged in trading in cattle. Parizat has four children. Three of her children work in Russia. Her little son is a school student. Parizat hopes to obtain this loan and buy sheep.\r\n\r\nGulzat K., 37, is a cattle breeder\u2019s wife. They have two children. Both Gulzat and her husband are engaged in breeding cattle. And Gulzat also sells milk. Their monthly income is around $180. Gulzat is in need of a loan. She hopes to buy construction materials for construction. \r\n\r\nKandalat S., 43, has four children. Her husband has gone to work in Russia. Kandalat keeps sheep and her monthly income is just a little over ten dollars. Kandalat hopes to obtain this loan and build a new fence, which would allow her to keep more sheep.\r\n \r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She works cultivating various tubers (potatoes, ocra, olluco, mashua), barley and wheat, and also has a food-sale business. Her husband works providing a public transport service and receives 1200 soles each monthly from a mining retirement settlement. With this money they cover the household costs and save the rest of their earnings to cover their childrens' higher education. As their activities are reasonably profitable, they live comfortably. In the future Lida and Gregorio plan to continue planting potatoes and wheat, which are the most sought-after products in the zone. They also want to improve the fittings of their food shop. This is the second time Lida has had a loan from MFP and as always she feels secure knowing that the members of her communal bank will work responsibly to repay their loans. Lida plans to invest this loan in the purchase of fertiliser for her crops and to acquire tyres for her husband's car, to hopefully offer a better service to travellers. \r\n\r\n<br

Pe\u00f1a is a 45-year old married woman who supports her family by operating two businesses:  selling charcoal and fire wood and operating a passenger tricycle. She lives in Purok 5 B., Masaling, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nSince 1999, she has been a member of Kiva partner NWTF-Project Dungganon and she has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average income of PHP 15,000. \r\n\r\nJudith is borrowing PHP 25,000 so that she can expand her charcoal and firewood business.  This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Judith aspires to elevate her family's living condition and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nJudith is shown in the picture with her tricycle which shuttles passengers around town and which she also uses to transport firewood and charcoal.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This is how she values things, small or great, and opportunities that come her way. She is married to Vergelio and is blessed with 2 children who are currently in high school. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines. Having finished only high school, Pacita is determined to pursue her desire of having her own business to have a good life and a bright future for her children. \r\n\r\nShe has operated her own buy-and-sell business of golf balls for 20 years now. She basically purchases these balls in bulk and repacks them into 150-200 PHP per pack and sells them to golfers. Her store is strategically located outside the Philippine Navy Golf Course in Taguig City, Metro Manila.  It is quite accessible to all golf players. She also offers candies and cold drinks (mineral water and soft drinks). Monthly, she earns an estimated net income of around 10,000 PHP.\r\n\r\nTo help continue operation of her business, Pacita is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this amount to purchase additional golf balls and candies to restock her inventory. She believes through the proper use of this loan, she will increase her earnings.\r\n\r\nPacita dreams of having her house renovated soon and be able to send her child all the way through college.

and her husband Walter have two children. Through a lot of effort and sacrifice in their work, they have built up their business of manufacturing and sale of caps and hats. This has allowed them to offer financial stability to their family, and more importantly an education to their children. They decided to work on this business 5 years ago, when Walter was unemployed after the business for which he worked  went bankrupt. This event motivated both of them to start their own business in their humble home, manufacturing accessories to then offer them for sale while walking along a busy street in their town, Juliaca. They both have many projects and hopes and they are willing to work hard every day to make their plans reality. Celia's wish, for now, is to have more capital to invest in materials with the goal of creating their products with better finishes and being able to distribute them in large quantities. To make this wish come true, she is asking for a loan of $175.

He lives in a household of 12 members  in Shewa. He is a very hard worker man, but he can't support his family so he would like to expand his business. He has therefore requested an individual loan of 30,000 Afghanis (USD$625) with a term of 27 months to complete his stock and buy some seeds and other items for his land.

They have three children; two of them have already graduated high school but put off college for a while due to financial constraints. Her youngest is still studying in high school. \r\nHelen is hoping to borrow PHP 9,000 to use in maintaining and growing her general store. Her two older children help her manage the business where they sell different grocery items, as well as fruits and vegetables. She is hoping to save enough within the next year for her children to be able to seek a college education. She believes that with the help of Kiva Lenders, and her patience towards managing her business, she will become successful and someday overcome the hardships of her life.

They all live together in their own home and strive to get ahead in life.  For the last 5 years she has sold grocery items from a store that she set up in her home.  Maria begins her work every morning accompanied by her youngest daughter, who helps out when she has the time.  She also works as a seamstress.  She set up a sewing machine in the store from where she sews garments at a reasonable price for whomever needs them.  As if this weren't enough, this hard-working woman occasionally takes in laundry for people who need this service.  Her desire to get ahead is never lacking.  She proves this because she never tires of working even though she has three adult children; she always wants to have a better quality of life.  For the future, she would like to enlarge her store and stock it with a greater variety and quality of products.  This is her 8th loan with MFP and she is committed to make her repayments punctually for, as she states, she is an honest woman.  Besides, she is very pleased with the work she does with her communal bank since together they all move forward responsibly with each loan.  The funds requested now will be used to buy stock items for her store so that she can start her expansion and improvement project.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":453951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy stock inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T20:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734990},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124326},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960068},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992912},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717698},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751378}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T21:14:43Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":168213,"name":"Foini","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Foini S. is 35 and married with 4 children (ages 9 - 15 years).  She owns a business venture of poultry.  Foini has 6 years of experience in this business.  Foini needs a loan of WST $750 to improve her business by purchasing chickens food and a fence to protect the chicken.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 310 tala or US $129 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Foini joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Foini's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Foini S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.89 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.99 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

The eight women members of this group live in Shiroles, Lim\u00f3n, located in the hot and humid Caribbean region of Costa Rica. This will be the group\u2019s first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. \r\n\r\nThe members are engaged in various productive activities. For example, some members are involved in animal rearing. These women will use this loan to invest in the purchase of livestock such as piglets or chicks as well as nutrients to feed them. The rearing and selling of livestock necessitates the construction of a house for the animals. As a result, this loan will also be used to make general investments in the construction of pens for animals. The women who are involved in pig rearing will need at least three months before they can butcher and, in turn, sell their pork products. \r\n\r\nOther group members are involved in clothing and catalogue sales. These women plan to use this loan to purchase clothing, cosmetics, kitchen items and various other products, which they will sell to members of their community.  Clothing items to be purchased include pants, blouses and children\u00b4s clothing. \r\n\r\nSome of the women are engaged in the harvest of plantains. For these members, this loan will be used to invest in the purchase of small plantain plants which will be planted for harvest. Due to the abundant amount of wildlife in Caribbean Costa Rica, in order to ensure the quality of plantains, it is necessary to protect them. For this reason, this loan will also be used to purchase protective bags that will be placed over plantains throughout their journey to maturity. \r\n\r\nIngrid M. A. is a 29-year-old mother who lives with her husband, daughter and nephew. Ingrid has a business selling perfumes: she collects orders in the Shiroles community and travels every 15 days to the closest big city (Lim\u00f3n) to make purchases.  This loan will be used by Ingrid to purchase perfumes that she will sell in her community. \r\n\r\nIngrid\u2019s main goals are to dedicate as much time as possible to selling perfumes and to provide financial support to her family. She hopes this loan will help her to increase her working capital and put her in a position to purchase more products for sale.

The women of the Benkadi 8 group place all their trust in the successful progress of this winter campaign, with help from Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":558513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Seedlings and fertiliser, small farming equipment and labor costs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Nangola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matou                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mah                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata Kassoum ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yassa                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assitan                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hariatou                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":430000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":430000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":430000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:50Z","rounded_local_amount":439957.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917801}],"funded_date":"2010-07-06T16:24:55Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":213855,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gloria tiene 40 a\u00f1os, es separada y vive con sus hijos en su casa propia.

She lives in her own house together with her husband and two children.  \r\n<p>\r\nYsabel works selling cosmetics from very well-known brands.  After submitting her list of requests, she distributes the products requested by her customers within three days.  This is how she has been working in the business for 22 years and she is passionate about it.  Over time, she has risen and is now sales manager.  What she likes most about her work are the campaigns presented because they mean a higher quantity of requests, making them very useful.  However, it is difficult when her customers do not pay on time.  In the future, she will continue to sell cosmetics to try and get more customers, since her end goal is to have a store to sell clothing.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Ysabel\u2019s 18th loan with MFP.  She will continue to be on time with her payments since the loan is very useful.  With the loan requested, she will purchase a display case to show her products and prevent them from being damaged.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":606985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a display case to show her beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T20:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ysabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":149.14},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":155.86},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":161.82},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":170.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":176.7},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":186.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.93},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.68},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.81},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.26},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":114.38,"local_amount":305,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":319.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449978},{"amount":60.68,"local_amount":161.82,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":169.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588677},{"amount":63.81,"local_amount":170.16,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":178.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725179},{"amount":66.26,"local_amount":176.7,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":185.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463271},{"amount":69.87,"local_amount":186.32,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":195.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886676}],"funded_date":"2010-10-10T15:32:33Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen O'Connell","image":578556}},{"id":238441,"name":"Chheng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chheng C. is a single mother who lives in Phnom Penh City.

Vaisiddin is married. His family lives in Kumsangir, Southern Tajikistan. Vaisiddin sells household items in his shop. Small ventures like Nuriddin\u2019s has become the only source of income for families in remote parts of Tajikistan. \r\n\r\nVaisiddin has been in the trade for 5 years. His business is characterized by stability and positive performance. The inventory he sells is always in demand as people need dishwasher, laundry soap, shampoos, perfumes, and other household items. \r\n\r\nVaisiddin wants to see his business growing in the future, which is why he is requesting a loan of $3000 USD to increase his turnover capital. He is hoping to boost further development of his business with this additional assistance. \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He plans to use the money from the loan to purchase fertilizer and seeds to be able to plant wheat on his land. When the wheat will be ready he plans to sell most of it on the market at an affordable price, while keeping the rest for his own family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population are still living in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He also earns supplementary income from owning a tailoring shop in his town. Overall, he says that lately the main challenge to his business is low market prices for his produce, which makes life difficult with the high input costs he faces.\r\n\r\nAlphonce has a successful history with Juhudi Kilimo, previously completing two loans of Kes 20,000 and Kes 40,000. He has now requested this loan of Kes 80,000 to expand his poultry farming operations and to purchase a dairy animal. He says that the extra income from this loan will help his family meet their basic needs without much struggle, and allow the children to get the best education.\r\n\r\nAlphonce has plans for expansion in the next five to ten years, and he recognizes the gains he has made since having access to capital in recent years.

abaca weaving  business. She lives in Masaba, Masaba, Danao City, Cebu . She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her abaca weaving  business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6800. \r\n\r\nCristina is now borrowing PHP 17000 so that she  could  purchase more weaving supplies. This will be her 5th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Cristina aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

In spite of the fact that he does not live with him, he loves him and provides him with a good quality of life.  For this reason, more than 15 years ago, he bought ten hectares of farm land where he grows coffee and bananas in large quantities.  What he most enjoys about farming is being in the fields, growing and caring for his crops which will soon bear fruit.  He tells us that during harvest time he buys and sells coffee as a middleman for a production company.  This makes him some extra money which he adds to the money that he makes for selling his own products.  However, the business activity which Elvis spends most of his time on is his business offering Internet services, a public telephone service (where people make telephone calls) and booths where people can watch movies.  This business is doing very well since there are no other businesses like it in his area.  He is the only one who works in this field.
