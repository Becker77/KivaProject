Barbara Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Santa Barbara Village Bank consists of 20 members, most of whom are women. The group is part of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari Project, an effort to proviD. microloans to people who live far from FINCA\u2019s Ayacucho office by sending loan officers out to the villages in which the clients themselves live. Fourteen group members live in the village of Santa Barbara, while six live in the neighboring villages of Huaynacondo and \u00d1eque. <p>\r\n\r\nThe group members are involved in a variety of businesses, but the most common economic activity is raising guinea pigs, or \u201ccuyes,\u201d a Peruvian delicacy. Some clients have just a few dozen guinea pigs, while others have many more. Gloria Susana, for example, has almost 500 guinea pigs, breeding, raising, and selling them to stores, restaurants and individuals to prepare. <p>\r\n\r\nGuinea pigs are very delicate, temperature-sensitive animals, so caring for them is quite labor-intensive. Many clients go out themselves at 4 or 5 p.m. each day to cut fresh alfalfa to feed them. Some other group members raise different animals, large and small, such as chickens, cows, and sheep, which they then fatten up and sell at livestock fairs. <p>\r\n\r\nOther group members sell dry goods and grains; many travel between Santa Barbara and the city of Ayacucho (which is about an hour away by car) to buy, sell or traD. their wares. <p>\r\n\r\nMost of the members plan to use their loans to buy more merchandise to sell, more young animals to raise, or more materials to make their products. Ambrosio, for example, buys seasonal local produce which he loads into a rented truck and brings to the city of Lima to sell. Right now, it is prickly pear season, so he will use his share of the loan to buy boxes of prickly pears. Leonardo is a basket-weaver, so he will use his loan to buy more reeds to make his baskets. Leonarda has a small store and also raises guinea pigs; she will use her loan portion to buy rice, sugar and soda to sell. <p>\r\n\r\nThe group is pictured along with their loan officer, Hector (far

Martines is 54 years old, and is a widow. Do\u00f1a Martina has 5 children. Her oldest son, 38, is self-employed. Her other son, of 34, is also self-employed. Her daughter, also 34, is in her fourth year of secondary school modules. Her son of 30, is not in his studies, and her youngest son of 28 doesn\u2019t work. Maria\u2019s intentions are to continue on with her business to support her family, given that it is difficult to maintain her current economic status because she has to support her mother and her children. Her wishes are to continue struggling to better their quality of life by transforming her house and giving her children an adequate place to live. Her dreams are to administrate a tortilla business, where she would be able to have an assistant with the production of tortillas, as her age does not allow her to spend a great deal of time on her feet. \r\nThe economic activity that Maria participates in is the production and elaboration of tortillas, and the sale of beans. The location of her business is in the annexed region, Austria. She has had her business for 4 years, starting it because she needed a means of generating income to support her family. She started with the sale of tortillas, with the initial amount of 50 kg of corn, with which she saw the results of her sacrifices. Later, she decided to establish another business in the sale of beans, which she sold for a period of time, until the price of beans as a product escalated. Later, she returned to the sale of beans because it generates the appropriate capital to buy necessary supplies like beans, corn, and wood, because investing in raw materials is necessary so that she may offer her products to her clients.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matt Capetola, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":252925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"capital for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-11T06:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Lorena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":578.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399972},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":578.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091970},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":578.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985354},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":578.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445970},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":578.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956611},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:21Z","rounded_local_amount":578.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174039}],"funded_date":"2009-01-11T08:12:01Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Capetola","image":null}},{"id":87078,"name":"Fe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ginger is known to be a great help to humankind.

(ASHI) - a partner micro-finance institution of KIVA - in the Philippines in 2006. The couple agreed on this decision to join the program. Her previous loans were utilized by financing a retail store. Today the store is their primary source of income aside from the income of her husband from his work. \r\n\r\nShe is glad that she was able to help her husband with their financial needs without leaving her household chores, and was able to finance a new project from her earnings, which is doormat weaving. Now she is applying for a loan of 13,500 PHP to use as additional capital for buying grocery products to sell, such as canned goods, sacks of rice and sugar, cases of soft drinks, liquors, cigarettes, bath and detergent soaps, toothpaste, shampoo and assorted noodles. \r\n\r\nShe is hopeful that with this new capital she can start saving in preparation for her children's future schooling and for renovation of their house. She is also planning to establish a new grocery store to increase her profit. She hopes that ASHI and KIVA will support her all the way in achieving her goals in life.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout IMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services.

She was married for over 20 years, but her husband abandoned her.  She now lives alone.  Her two children got a loan to be able to buy soldering equipment and be able to work.  Delfina lives in the Maica Sud community in Cochabamba.  She has three cows.  She uses their milk to make cheese and sell it at different markets in the city of Cochabamba and to people who sell \u201cCharque\u201d (a traditional dish eaten with cheese in Cochabamba).  Delfina has been making cheese for over 32 years.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy food for her livestock (corn husks).  Due to drought problems, the cost has increased a great deal.  She does not have enough to buy all of the food that the cows need.  This way they will not have trouble producing the same quantity of milk that they now produce.

She is an experienced businesswoman who has sold cloth and flowerpots for more than ten years.  She is in her fifties but very energetic.  She buys her goods in Dakar and sells them  in St Louis.  She is asking for a loan of 150,000 francs to build up her inventory.\r\n\r\nMs Di\u00e8ne has benefited from an agreement between U-IMCEC and the PDEF (The Children and Family Development Program) of Seydina Issa Laye. The purpose of PDEF is to reduce poverty in the community and primarily to protect children from disadvantaged families. This agreement has provided their parents with loans on more flexible terms than are available from conventional sources. Since the agreement went into effect in December, 2008, 120 parents have had loans varying from 50,000 to 150,000 francs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Michael Briggs, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has made a living for a number of years selling soft drinks, refreshments, snacks and other products outside a hospital in Chep\u00e9n. This provides her with income to help her husband provide for the family. Her business enjoys success, and its main customers are passersby and people coming to visit sick relatives.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling ready-to-wear clothing and shoe products from NATASHA and AVON in the local community. Maricel has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Maricel joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maricel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. Maricel is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell such as t-shirts and blouses. This loan will be Maricel's second loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Mrs. Matogoma is in high demand for the quality of her services.\r\n\r\nWanting to better serve a steadily increasing clientele, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso a few months ago. This is her first individual loan, which she will use to buy spare parts for her three sewing machines. She will also buy fabrics to sew and sell.

In particular, the family has 5 milk cows. They sell milk and other dairy products at the local market. Also, they have 500 nut trees. Harvested nuts are sold to the wholesalers, seasonally. Josef also runs a bee-keeping business, which consists of 20 beehives. Total average monthly income of the family is 390 Laris (GEL-Georgian Lari).\r\n\r\nJosef has requested credit for purchasing an additional 3-4 bee-hives and bee-colonies.

As a result of these investments, the family will get more honey and increased harvest of nuts in the relevant seasons. These increases will positively influence the income of the family.

The members of the group decided to name it that because the area where they live is at the top of a hill and from there you can see a beautiful wooded landscape where the frost does not harm the trees. The group has existed before but the clients were in arrears and had many problems. Today all of them are new members to the group, except for Carlos S. who\u2019s been in the group since the first loan. \r\n\r\nJuan has been the representative of the group. He\u2019s been married for 39 years, and he\u2019s been married to Lorenza for 27 years. Together they have had four children, Eduardo who is 12 and in secondary school, Anayeli who is 9 and in primary school, Wendy who is 7 and in the second year of secondary school, and Juan who is the youngest at 5 years old and in preschool. \r\n\r\nJuan raises sheep and later sells them with they are grown. He has been in this business for 28 years. Now he doesn\u2019t have any problem since he cares for them very well and he takes them to the veterinarian if they are sick. Now he has asked for a loan to buy two sheep he had at home but later sold, and now he will start again. Juan\u2019s hope is that the animals he raises and breeds will be able to increase his stock and income. The others in the group will also buy sheep. Almost no one buys food since they take advantage of the pastures they have in the community in order to save on food. Each day they go to the pasture. Only Carlos will buy chickens, also for breeding and later resale. \r\n\r\n\"We are very thankful for the new opportunity that they offer us and we are confident that as a group we will not lose face.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":884009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy two sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-10-05T02:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonifacia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonifacio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:23:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3570.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618916},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3570.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573160},{"amount":393.75,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5356.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784871},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1785.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193445}],"funded_date":"2011-10-09T23:45:13Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jodi Nelan","image":426481}},{"id":346106,"name":"Pay In Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT), a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone is very pleased to present to you members of the \u201cPay In\u201d group.

Ibrogim is a very courageous man that is characterized as someone who can manage tough jobs like raising cattle and agriculture. He's the father of four adult children and has the responsibility of supporting his family and providing them with everything that they need. In spite of his difficult economic situation and after much time, he has been able to get ahead in his business through the purchase of cattle to breed them on his property. His greatest goal nowadays is to improve his economic situation and provide a better way of life for his family. It's for this reason that Ibrogim comes to IMON International for loans for the purchase of animals so that he may breed them.     \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She seeks to improve her economic conditions by harnessing her skills in the design and construction of pi\u00f1atas (papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 containers containing candies and other goodies) and other party materials and through the sale of school supplies. The loan consultant who has been working with Ericka over the past few months describes her as a person with good principles who is seeking to improve her living conditions.\r\n\r\nEricka\u2019s products are used when celebrating events such as marriages, birthdays and communions. Ericka believes that selling school supplies represents an opportunity for her to earn a higher level of income because she lives close to a school and, at the moment, no one else is offering such products for sale. \r\n\r\nEricka has been working over the past ten years in the production and sale of party materials; she started her business with an initial investment of 20,000 colons (approximately 35 USD). She is applying for a loan because she would like to start selling products from her home, as a kind of bazaar. In addition to the party materials she already produces, she has the idea of selling school supplies. This loan will be used to make investments in school supplies and materials necessary to the creation of party materials such as pi\u00f1atas and handmade invitations.\r\n\r\nEricka makes party materials and pi\u00f1atas on a per order basis which allows her to customize her products to the needs of her clients. Some of her clients request pi\u00f1atas in the shape of famous superheroes while others request pi\u00f1atas resembling famous princesses. Ericka spends, on average, twenty-five hours a week producing and selling her products. Her flexible work schedule allows her to take care of her children and perform domestic duties and allocate the rest of her day to her business.\r\n\r\nEricka\u2019s main obstacle is financial. This loan will provide much needed working capital to get her business off the ground. Additionally, she faces competition in her neighborhood for certain products that she offers. Her goal is to expand her business, secure more clients and earn enough money to finance the studies of her children. In the future she would like to own a store separate from her home where she could sell a variety of products.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":499578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase materials necessary for the creation of party products and to buy school supplies to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"San Jos\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-03-04T17:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ericka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":14808.32},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15055.13},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15306.05},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15561.15},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15820.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":16084.18},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":16352.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":16624.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":16901.86},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":17183.56},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":17469.95},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":17761.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":18057.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":18358.08},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":18655.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.6},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.08},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.57},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.06},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.07},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.58},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.12},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.65},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.19},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.31},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":28.14,"local_amount":14808.32,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":15577.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949205},{"amount":30.17,"local_amount":15880.14,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":16704.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136678106},{"amount":30.68,"local_amount":16144.81,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":16983.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712579},{"amount":23.11,"local_amount":12160.9,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":12792.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172258674},{"amount":362.9,"local_amount":191005.83,"processed_date":"2012-12-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":200926.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322995748}],"funded_date":"2010-03-04T22:42:56Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:56:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":186288,"name":"Kely Yohanna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Kely A. vive en el barrio Los \u00c1ngeles en el occidente de Barranquilla, con sus dos hijos de 7 y 3 a\u00f1os de edad y su esposo que trabaja en la arquidi\u00f3cesis de esta misma ciudad.

Kely is 27-years old and makes a living selling costume jewelry.  She has been an entrepreneur since she was a girl, selling first to her school friends when she was a teenager.  At times, the family lived on her sales but she was ultimately able to buy the small lot where they now live and they have gradually developed it.  She has a glass case for the business where she can display her products but her best customers are her husband's co-workers and the nurses and aides at a rehabilitation center where she takes her daughter for treatment.  This is the first time that Kely has applied to the Fundacion for a loan.  Her brother, who has links with the bank, recommended that she apply.  She will use the $1,500,000 loan to stock her business.

He wants to give his children a better education. \r\n\r\nThe fields with Juan\u2019s crops have always been a necessary activity in his life in order to survive.  Since he was very small his parents always taught him how to work on the farm.  That is why he decided to continue with this familial work.\r\n\r\nNow he has his own land where he has planted potatoes, peas, and \u201collucos\u201d (a root vegetable).

He knows that the family\u2019s peace of mind is dependent upon this activity.\r\n\r\nHe has been doing this activity for 40 years.  He thinks that the most difficult part in taking care of the crops is the abrupt changes in weather.  This greatly affects his productivity.  Later, he wishes to keep working hard and improve his crops.\r\n\r\nThis is Juan\u2019s fourth loan with MFP.  He knows that the money from the loan will be very beneficial in developing this activity.  He is a very responsible member of his communal bank.

She is married and has 3 children between the ages of 24 and 18. In 2008, she established a business raising cows. Working 7 days a week and 5 hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid 5 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buy a young dairy cow. In the future, Sumitra plans to uplift the economic conditions of her family. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

He is a single and hard-working man who lives with his mother in his own home in the community of Sanchirio (in the central Peruvian jungle).  This young, dynamic man has been farming for 8 years.  His main crops are coffee and bananas.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Reyner has cared for his land.  He has managed to achieve many things, including buying his own plot of land which meant he was able to invest more capital in his crops.  However, what he most likes doing is selling his crops because he then sees the results of all his hard work in front of him.  Most of the traders in the city's wholesale market know Reyner and they comment that he is a good farmer and they recognize the quality of his coffee beans.  In the future, he would like to continue improving the quality of his crops.\r\n\r\nThis is Reyner's first loan with MFP and he is grateful for the trust which has been placed in him.  He assures us that with the support of his community bank he will achieve his goals.

As her husband works full-time in Zamiin Uud, he is rarely at home. That's why she decided to pursue a small business by herself, instead of solely depending on her husband's salary. In 2005, she rented a small space and ran a small teashop. However, due to high rent, she decided to exit the teashop business. In 2009, she acquired a license to become an official distributor for a Russian company that sells health products extracted from bees' honey. Since she is the only one with the license in her town, she hopes to do well with the business. Since the start a few months earlier, her sales of health products have been doing considerably well. She says that she is working hard to introduce the honey products to locals and needs a personal computer to make marketing materials and purchase products online. She requests a loan to purchase a computer with Internet capabilities, with which she can do her own less costly marketing and order her products online.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank:\r\nFounded in 1998, XacBank is a community development bank and microfinance institution in Mongolia, and is headquartered in Ulaanbaatar.

She's thirty-four years old. In these difficult times, when jobs are scarce and even if one is found, the pay is hardly satisfactory, one of the most profitable jobs available to the average person is to become a salesman on the market. But in order for this to transpire a capital and entrepreneurial skills are required. The most valuable skill is, probably, the ability to take risks. Asiyam didn't wait for any changes or for outside help, but decided to start her own business. She could not afford to sit helplessly; her husband had to leave for Almaty City. Five years ago she approached a company specializing in microcrediting; received a loan, bought goods and started to sell clothes on the market. She could easily pick out the clothes that people would later buy from her, and so her business was successful. Her husband still works in Almaty City. Asiyam has three children: two girls and a boy. Her daughters are twelve and ten and her son is just three years old. Her daughters go to school and help look after their younger brother when they come home, which is considerable help for Asiyam. Her business is very successful even considering the recent decline in trade. She has been able to buy some livestock for her household and raise her families\u2019 quality of life. Right now her monthly income is about fifteen thousand soms ($350), whereas she had started her business with just five thousand soms ($116).

The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling used clothing and shoe products (ukay-ukay). She also buys and sells assorted products such as toys, combs, needles and threads. Sabina has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 Sabina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sabina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Sabina is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional stocks of used clothing. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Sabina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

de 18 a\u00f1os, es un joven empe\u00f1oso. Soltero y con planes claros para el futuro, vive en la casa de sus padres en la comunidad nativa San Pablo de Shaoriato. Desde que ten\u00eda 7 a\u00f1os ayudaba a sus padres en el campo, de esa manera aprendi\u00f3 sobre lo duro y gratificante que puede ser las jornadas.\nA sus 18 a\u00f1os ya cuenta con 2 lotes de terrenos de 20 por 15 metros cada uno. En ellos siembra kion y naranjas. Frutos que traslada hacia la ciudad de Pichanaki para su venta al por mayor inmediata, pues cuenta con compradores fijos. Pero deja una menor producci\u00f3n para expenderla al por menor.\n\u201cEl kilo de ki\u00f3n est\u00e1 a 1.50 soles y su cosecha es cada 7 u 8 meses, depende de los cuidados, abonamiento y limpieza\u201d, explica. Los suelos f\u00e9rtiles de su comunidad son propicios para el crecimiento y desarrollo de grandes y jugosos kiones. Adem\u00e1s los r\u00edos de la zona son cuna de card\u00famenes de peces. Rosendo caza y vende pescados como: \u201cChupadora\u201d \u201cBarb\u00f3n\u201d a los visitantes de su comunidad.  Este joven emprendedor prioriza su evoluci\u00f3n como persona, ampliando sus sembr\u00edos y mejorando la producci\u00f3n. Posteriormente tendr\u00e1 su familia, pero no est\u00e1 en sus planes cercanos. Ser\u00eda la primera vez que Rosendo acceder\u00eda a un cr\u00e9dito de MFP. Se siente contento de pertenecer a su banco comunal. Por esa raz\u00f3n, da su palabra de ser puntual en el pago de las cuotas y responsable con las actividades dentro del grupo. De obtener el pr\u00e9stamo, Rosendo invertir\u00e1 en el pago de operarios que trabajar\u00e1n sus terrenos, en el \u201cporcado\u201d (acumulaci\u00f3n de la tierra alrededor de la planta), y  deshierbo (limpieza de sembr\u00edos).\n\n","en":"Rosendo, 18, is a hard-working young man with clear plans for the future.  He is single, and lives in his parents home in his native village of San Pablo de Shariato.  Since he was 7 he helped his parents in the fields and thus learned how hard and gratifying daily work can be.\r\n\r\nAt 18 he has 2 fields of 20 and 15 meters each.  Here he plants kions (a ginger-like tuber) and oranges, fruits that he transports to Pichanaki to sell wholesale right away to regular buyers but he also keeps a small amount to sell retail.\r\nHe says,  \"The kilo of kion is 1.50 sols and his harvest is every 7 or 8 months, depending on the care, fertilizing and weeding\".  The fertile soil in his community is favorable to the growth and development of big and juicy kions.  Also the rivers in his area are thick with schools of fish.  Rosendo fishes and sells fish called: \"Chupadora\", and \"Baron\", to the people who come to his village.  This young entrepreneur prioritizes his development as a person, increasing his planting and improving his production.  In the future he will have a family but this is not in his plans at the moment.  This will be the first time that Rosendo requests a loan with MFP.  He feels happy to belong to the communal bank.  Thus, he promises to be punctual in making the payments and responsible in the activities of the group.  He will use the loan to pay the people who work his fields, in the \u201cporcado\u201d (forming dirt around the plants) and in weeding (cleaning the crops).\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":919267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He is requesting PHP 5,000.00 as start-up capital for his business. His wife will manage the store. \r\n\r\nRoderick has a job at the Municipal Nursery.  He is thankful that he has additional income for his family and that his wife will be having fun managing their business. In the future, Roderick hopes to expand his sari-sari to a mini grocery store and to have a house of their own for his family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":277259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase supplies for his store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Calamba-Mapang, Rizal Zamboanga Del Norte","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":"2009-02-23T05:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roderick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1006.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27124347},{"amount":45.14,"local_amount":1805.68,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2180.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36019729},{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1006.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52998520},{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T17:30:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1006.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63219989},{"amount":17.31,"local_amount":692.32,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T20:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":835.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73710007}],"funded_date":"2009-02-23T06:00:49Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T20:19:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kay and Fred Tierney","image":92188}},{"id":95334,"name":"Nikolay","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nikolay is married with one son.

He hopes to have more children some day.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":435118,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":1460,"youtubeId":"6aPUGhkXr0M","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur Omar Antonia  from  Nicaragua","thumbnailImageId":435118},"activity":"Motorcycle Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy motorcycle parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2009-11-27T05:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Omar Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":652.53},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":672.11},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":692.27},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":713.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":734.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":756.46},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":779.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.63},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.6},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.72},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.82},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.63,"local_amount":652.53,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":676.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110661411},{"amount":33.6,"local_amount":672.11,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":696.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118057057},{"amount":34.62,"local_amount":692.27,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":717.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123892055},{"amount":35.65,"local_amount":713.04,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":739.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128925718},{"amount":36.72,"local_amount":734.43,"processed_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:02:15Z","rounded_local_amount":761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136653301},{"amount":37.82,"local_amount":756.46,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":784.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144685995},{"amount":38.96,"local_amount":779.16,"processed_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:34:37Z","rounded_local_amount":807.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151869737}],"funded_date":"2009-11-27T15:17:19Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:34:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"N Aviva","image":null}},{"id":161121,"name":"Rosa Cacilda","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Rosa Cacilda D. nasceu na cidade da Matola, Prov\u00edncia de Maputo, tem 52 anos de idade, separada e m\u00e3e de 5 filhos de 29, 27, 24, 21 e 10 anos de idade todos v\u00e3o a escola.

She is 52 years old, divorced and the mother of 5 children. Her children are 29, 27, 24, 21, and 10 years old and they are all in school. She went to school until the 5th grade and didn't continue because her parents could not afford her to. She lives in her own house with her children and six grandchildren.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1975, she left Matola to live in the Patrice Lumumba neighborhood. In 1996, she separated from her husband and settled in Boane where she currently lives with her children. She has her own business in her backyard. She works from 7am to 10pm, depending on the flow of customers. She started this activity in 1985 due to a number of hardships she has faced in her day to day life. She does not have any employees and has an income of around 5.000.00mt per month which goes toward household expenses and savings in Xitique, a traditional rotational savings system. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has never had loans from other banks. She discovered Hluvuku through neighbors who are also members. This will be her fourth loan. She requests 15.000.00mt to buy building materials (cement, stones, sand and iron) to increase the size of her house. The previous loans were for 5.000.00mt, 10.000.00mt and 13.600.00mt and were all used for the same activity. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, she would like to request more loans to finish her construction

She earns her living by operating a rice retailing business. Her husband Jeremias C., age 53, earns a living as a construction worker and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 16 to 25 years old. \r\n\r\nAida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Aida has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 18,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,000 PHP; thus, improving the family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP to buy more rice. She will use the profits to meet basic everyday needs as well as allowance for the kids to go to school and for medicine for her sick mother-in-law. All the while, she is trying her best to continue to save up for the future. Aida C. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

S. is 38 years old, widowed and has 2 children ages 13 and 6 years old, whom he hopes to give good education to the university level. \r\n\r\nRonald is a charcoal dealer in Mombasa. Mombasa is along the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many tourist attraction sites, particularly the Indian ocean white beaches. Ronald has been selling charcoal for the last 2 years to the local people and has managed to give employment to 2 people. He says that this business is profitable, but the major challenge he has is there are so many people in the same kind of business as his in the area, so customers are spoiled for choice.

She is married to Edgar, a security guard, and mother to their three children. The eldest is already in college while the youngest is still in elementary school. She, together with her husband and children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEmily operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmily hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":865538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"    To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business..","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-09-10T14:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3519.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764621},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.03,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2815.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571742},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2815.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529292},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1407.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738512}],"funded_date":"2011-09-11T19:34:29Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":337948,"name":"Marlyn","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marlyn desde Pradomar,cerca a las Payas en el municipio de Puerto Colombia, da las gracias a sus financiadores por apoyar tantos negocios peque\u00f1os en el mundo; ella est\u00e1 prepar\u00e1ndose para su segundo credikiva, porque va a comprar ingredientes para elaborar sus productos como harina de trigo, aceite , az\u00facar, margarina, carnes fr\u00edas, desechables y bandejas, as\u00ed mismo comprar\u00e1 un molino el\u00e9ctrico de ma\u00edz y har\u00e1 algunas reformas locativas al sal\u00f3n de producci\u00f3n.

Four of her older children (2 boys and 2 girls) are working away from home and rarely visit, leaving her to take care of the family and all the housework on her own.  Mrs. T. starts loaning money in 1998 with the starting amount of $50 to invest in her butchery business.  After her four children grew up and left home, without any one to help out, she had to change to fish-farming and raising pigs.  Her husband, Mr. Tran Minh Quy, is a disable war veteran but has helped her a lot in both of these businesses.  On average, for every farrow of pig she sells (usually once in every 3 months) she earns a profit of $150.  Currently, Mrs T. is asking for a loan of $825 to invest in her home projects.  This amount of money will be used to buy breeding fish (for $312), breeding pig (for $200) and foodstuff for them (for $312).\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Anh Hoai Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Tuy\u1ebft, 55 tu\u1ed5i s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng v\u1edbi ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 c\u00f4 con g\u00e1i nu\u00f4i t\u1ea1i x\u00e3 H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o, huy\u1ec7n H\u01b0ng Nguy\u00ean, Ngh\u1ec7 An. 4 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con l\u1edbn g\u1ed3m 2 trai, 2 g\u00e1i \u0111\u1ec1u \u0111i l\u00e0m \u0103n xa \u00edt c\u00f3 d\u1ecbp v\u1ec1 th\u0103m cha m\u1eb9, ch\u1ecb Tuy\u1ebft m\u1ed9t m\u00ecnh ch\u0103m lo h\u1ea7u h\u1ebft c\u00f4ng vi\u1ec7c trong gia \u0111\u00ecnh.

Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"The Claritas Group comes from a beautiful town that is situated in the mountains that surround Atitl\u00e1n Lake. This is a very traditional town. Here, one can find the women walking through the streets wearing their traditional outfits and speaking Quiche, a Mayan language. The people from Santa Clara are friendly people and are respectful T. strangers. \r\n<p>Santa Clara is passing through an important time, especially for the women. For the last few years, the women in the community are being recognized as independent people that can make important economic decisions and be responsible for them. This attitude opens more doors for microfinance.\r\n<p> The members of Claritas are a group of incredible and warm women. They meet three times a week T. carry out their financial transactions with The Friendship Bridge. \r\n<p>The Claritas Group has been recognized by The Friendship Bridge as excellent clients. They continue working with a project for years, always repaying punctually and standing out as leaders within their communal banks. The success of this group is based on the fact that all of the members are very responsible and that they have confidence in each other. The members maintain that the money they earn is not T. be spent, but is T. be invested because only then will they get returns and generate profits. \r\n<p>Many of the clients that work in this communal bank invest their loan inT. bakeries. Santa Clara is known for the delicious bread that it produces. Some of the women make bread in their homes, then they bring the bread T. a neighboring village, San Juan la Laguna, and they sell it there. The interesting thing is that they put the bread inT. baskets that they carry on their heads and will sell it from house T. house! Other women work in the production of beaded belts. Also, there is a member who bought a dressmaking machine with her loans. Finally, there is a woman that breeds animals, such as chickens and pigs, for sale. \r\n<p>This is a special group, and we should accompany them on their journey and support them. With your support, you will be able T. give them the opportunity T. improve their lives. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by A. Shah, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Las Claritas provienen de un bello pueblo que est\u00e1 ubicado en las monta\u00f1as que rodean el m\u00e1gico lago de Atitl\u00e1n. Este pueblo es muy tradicional. En este se puede encontrar a todas las mujeres caminando por las calles vistiendo sus trajes tradicionales y hablando el maya- Quiche. Un aspecT. muy bueno de los Santa Clare\u00f1os es que son gente amigables y respetuosos con los extranjeros. \r\n\r\n<P>Santa Clara est\u00e1 pasando por un momenT. importante, especialmente para las mujeres. Desde hace unos a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s, las mujeres dentro de la comunidad, est\u00e1n siendo reconocidas como personas indepedientes que pueden tomar decisiones econ\u00f3micas importantes y ser responsable de ellas. Para nuestro beneficio esa actitud le abre m\u00e1s puertas al micro- cr\u00e9diT..  \r\n\r\n<P>Las Claritas son un grupo de mujeres incre\u00edbles, en lo personal me qued\u00e9 impresionado cuando entr\u00e9 al cuarT. donde este grupo de se\u00f1oras se reunen tres veces por semana para efectuar sus transacciones financieras con The Friendship Bridge. Desde que llegu\u00e9 al cuarT. ellas fueron muy c\u00e1lidas conmigo, fue una experiencia muy agradable. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Claritas han sido reconocidas por The Friendship Bridge como clientas de excelencia. Ellas llevan trabajando con el proyecT. por a\u00f1os, siempre pagando puntualmente y destac\u00e1ndose como lideres dentro de sus bancos comunales. El \u00e9xiT. de este grupo se base en que todas las clientes son muy responsables y se tienen confianza entre ellas.  Durante la reuni\u00f3n le pregunte a una cliente sobre sus decisiones con respecT. al dinero y ella respondi\u00f3 que \u201cel dinero no se gasta, solo se invierte porque sino no da vuelta y no se genera ganancia\u201d\r\n\r\n<P>Un gran n\u00famero de clientas que trabajan en este banco comunal invierten su cr\u00e9diT. en panader\u00edas. Santa Clara es conocido por el delicioso pan que produce. Algunas de las se\u00f1oras producen el pan en sus casas, luego se lo llevan en un carro a la aldea aleda\u00f1a, San Juan la Laguna, y lo van a vender ah\u00ed. Lo interesante es que ponen el pan en canastos que lo cargan en la cabeza y van a vender de casa en casa! Otras se\u00f1oras trabajan en la elaboraci\u00f3n de fajas de mostacilla. Tambi\u00e9n hay una clienta que con sus pr\u00e9stamos se pudo comprar una m\u00e1quina de confecci\u00f3n. Finalmente, hay una se\u00f1ora que cr\u00eda animales, pollos y cerdos para su venta. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo es especial y creo que debemos acompa\u00f1arlos y apoyarlos, y ustedes con su apoyo van a poder darle la oportunidad de superarse."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":185960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To
