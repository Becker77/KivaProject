","en":"Mr. Mamadou D. is a 29-year-old merchant. He lives in Sangalkam, a locality in the Bambilor area. He has been a member of the Bambilor branch of U-IMCEC since January 2010, and is married without children.\r\n\r\nSince 2002 he operates a store where he sells various types of merchandise. He learned this activity from his family and was an apprentice for a long time before opening his own store. What attracts him most in this activity are the financial returns thanks to which he can satisfy his personal needs.\r\n\r\nMr. D. is requesting a loan for 400,000 francs so that he can open a second store not far from the first. The credit loans enable him to increase his earnings and cover his family\u2019s food and healthcare needs.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva

The members of this bank meet every 15 days, and the majority of them live in the neighborhood where they meet. Vilma has had a dressmaking business for 5 years, and she enjoys this work very much.  She also sells Avon products to her customers from her home.  She is married and has 4 married children.  She is a grandmother, and her husband works as a driver. Vilma has been taking loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n for 7 years, and it is going very well. With this new loan she will be able to invest in her businesses.  She always divides her loans by purchasing Avon products as well as fabric, thread, fasteners, buttons and lace.  She sells her beauty products without leaving the house; when her orders arrive she calls her customers and they come to get the products, so she can dedicate her time to sewing.  When she has to deliver her garments, her daughter-in-laws help her with the household tasks, which is a great help, and this way she can deliver her garments to her customers on time.  She tells us that the best month for her business is December.  She buys her products with cash, and she allows her customers credit in 2 or 3 payments.  She has never gotten behind in her payments to the fundaci\u00f3n, where she is considered to be a very responsible person who is dedicated to her work.  Her dream is to be able to make some repairs to her house which are needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlenda has been a member of the communal bank \"Francisco Pacheco\" for 3 years, and she is doing very well with the loans that she has received.  She is married and has 2 children.  She maintains a very stable and happy home.  Her activity is the sale of Yanbal beauty products; she has been doing this work for 5 years.  She also maintains a business with her husband selling household utensils, which they have had for 7 years.  Glenda, along with her husband, has made progress with her businesses.  When they started to sell household utensils it was not going well because they did not know how to manage their sales; many of the customers were unreliable and never paid them, but they were not defeated.  They continued on, learning, and after a while it started to go better.  At this moment they have an established business that is well-stocked with household appliances such as: TVs, refrigerators, and other items.  They deliver all of these appliances door to door, and extend credit at payments that go from 1 to 10 dollars a week.  Her husband is in charge of making the collections, and their business has expanded to various cantons in the province such as Tosagua, 24 De Mayo, Jipijapa, and others.  They have had approximately 5,000 customers over the 7 years that they have run this business.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan that she is requesting from the Fundaci\u00f3n, Glenda will use part of the loan to buy beauty products such as makeup and perfumes, and with the other part she will buy cooking utensils and appliances.  Glenda's main wish is to finish her education and buy herself a house, since at the moment they are renting.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4550,"image":{"id":551339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics, fabrics, buttons, fasteners, pots, blenders, large frying pans, etc.   ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4550,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Agueda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Glenda Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariuxi Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yilda De Las Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilia Amanda Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mariana Del Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alexa Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lita Idalida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4532,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":566.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":566.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":566.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":566.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":566.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":566.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":566.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":566.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":568.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":568.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":568.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":568.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":568.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":568.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":568.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":568.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1706.25,"local_amount":1699.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632919},{"amount":1706.25,"local_amount":1699.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846953},{"amount":1137.5,"local_amount":1133,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113414}],"funded_date":"2010-07-15T09:55:18Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":210996,"name":"Dorotia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorotia O. is from the village of Lagonglong, Misamis Oriental.

is 57 years old, married, and has 3 children. He lives in Ruai town, in the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya. Leonard started his hardware shop in 2003 when he retired. He had previously worked as a salesman with three of the top food and other manufacturing companies in Kenya, namely East African Industries, Warner Company, and Proctar and Allan. \r\nWhile in employment, Leonard was saving money with one of the Sacco Societies in Kenya called Jitegemee Saving and Credit. After retiring, he pulled together his resources and started a hardware shop with a capital of Ksh 200,000 (US$2,860). His wife who works with Kenya Polytechnic, a technical institute in Kenya, lent him a part of this capital. Leonard started out by renting a small stall by the roadside of the main Ruai \u2013 Kangundo road. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Works demolished his shop along with other structures located near the road. This significantly affected his business, but he did not lose hope. Within three months, Leonard was able to rent another shop that has been operating ever since.  \r\nIn the recent past, Leonard has been having difficulties in fulfilling his customers\u2019 demands that are increasing day by day because of his fair pricing of goods. By making purchases from his shop, his customers save a lot of time, since, otherwise, they would have to go all the way to Nairobi in order to purchase the same goods. Leornard is therefore asking for a loan of US$350 which he will use to purchase more stock for his hardware shop, including items like jikos (traditional cooking stoves), plastic basins, sufurias (cooking pots), spades, etc. These are items that are in very high demand; therefore, their acquisition will make a big difference for the community that Leonard is supplying. The loan will also help improve the condition for Leonard's children, his aging mother and mother in law who depend on him. He plans to employ two helpers from the community to assist in day-to-day running of the shop. The repayment period for his loan will be 8 -14 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":47006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of stock for a hardware shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ruai, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-07-05T23:44:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-07-20T03:27:47Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2007-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2007-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2007-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2007-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-09-20T09:18:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":56742},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-10-20T09:21:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":69891},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-11-20T10:23:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":84124},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-12-20T10:25:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99933},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2008-01-20T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118728},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138892},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2008-03-20T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":161937},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-04-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":187089}],"funded_date":"2007-07-06T03:27:47Z","paid_date":"2008-04-20T09:08:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":11,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":17598,"name":"Allani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Allani N. is 36 years old dynamic woman.

Durante toda su vida se ha dedicado al trabajo de la agricultura y ganader\u00eda siendo una dama muy esforzada que a diario lucha por mantener su hogar y suplir todas las necesidades.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nEl municipio de Achuapa es una localidad muy alejada de la ciudad y se caracteriza por ser una zona rural que no posee energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica. Ante este problema, la se\u00f1ora Georgina hace uso de candiles por la noche pero al ver que esta problem\u00e1tica puede erradicarse, solicita un panel solar para su hogar. Una vez instalado el panel su obligaci\u00f3n como persona responsable es pagar esta deuda y es por esta raz\u00f3n que acude a Ceprodel solicitando pr\u00e9stamo para cubrir la deuda y mejorar la condici\u00f3n de su hogar de habitaci\u00f3n. Por medio del panel solar tiene derecho a dos l\u00e1mparas de 50 Watts y un peque\u00f1o televisor. Su anhelo es ir invirtiendo en las necesidades de su hogar para darle lo mejor a sus hijos.\r\n<\/div>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":132656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He has several calves which he feeds and resells. After that he buys young calves and after feeding them for 40-45 days resells again on the same markets. He has a cow house where he keeps them and has been in this business for four years.<p>\r\nAnimal husbandry is one of the main types of business in the rural areas. The season of buying and selling of calves is here and Djurabek wants to buy another calve. It will help him increase commodity turnover and receive additional income. He does not have enough money and decided to apply for a loan.

She is a 41 year old saleswoman and resident of the Laureles Norte neighborhood in the city of Managua.  Six months ago she began selling used clothing starting with the distribution of liquidation supplies she received from abroad.  Her main goal is to support the advanced studies of her 15 year old daughter.  She also would like to purchase a vehicle to distribute her merchandise in order to expand her business to the northern part of the country which will help her gain better financial stability for her family.  To reach these goals she is requesting a loan to be repaid within nine months to puchase 5 packages of clothing to make available to her customary clients and the general public.

She also sells rice by the kilogram in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately $200 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Erma joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nErma is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 3rd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Christine of Balikyewunya Gayaza women's group in Kampala can relate to the aforementioned statement, given that for the last twenty years she has successfully been presiding over her secondhand clothing sales business in Kampala. She has been able to live within her means from this business for all these years. In a way, being a widow also pushed her to work extra hard, knowing she had to raise school fees for her kids. \r\n\r\nPreviously she was more into banana sales. It was a business that did not generate much in terms of profits, but she still managed to survive. Now, however, she wants to rejuvenate her current business with the purchase of more bales of used clothing to resell. In a week she makes about $27, a relatively low figure considering the responsibilities she has.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4600,"image":{"id":597224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"The purchase of more bales of clothes for resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-09-18T12:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4600,"lender_count":149,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fausta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bosco","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohammad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Allen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":10300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":643750},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":643750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":537.64,"local_amount":1203850,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1209693.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297354},{"amount":1870.03,"local_amount":4187247,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4207573.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467633},{"amount":920.95,"local_amount":2062128,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2072138.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605721},{"amount":1250.27,"local_amount":2799524,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2813113.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744785},{"amount":21.11,"local_amount":47251,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":47480.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191483461}],"funded_date":"2010-09-18T18:32:02Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:07:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":235594,"name":"Shahnaz Syed Riaz's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shahnaz lives in the city of Lahore, the second largest city of Pakistan which is known for its history and culture.

They have two children who are 2 and 3 years old. \r\n\r\nMa.Glenda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma.Glenda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,700, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, with which she intends to buy items for the general store to sell to her customers so that she can continue to save up for her children's education. \r\n\r\nMa.Glenda S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n About NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Her dream is to be able to one day have a large business where she makes chipas, so that she can become a distributor and be able to give work to other people. \r\n\r\nHilaria requests a loan to buy starch, lard, eggs, salt and other ingredients to be able to make the chipas that she sells. \r\n\r\nEveryone in the group is very thankful to Kiva and to Fundaci\u00f3n for the opportunity they have received. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":987566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy starch, lard, eggs, salt and other ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Carapegua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.8 -57.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2012-01-23T21:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blasida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Severiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simona ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":5072124,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":845354},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":845354},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":845354},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":845354},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":845354},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":845354}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":845354,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:25:01Z","rounded_local_amount":847000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257191341},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":845354,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":847000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263327617},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":845354,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":847000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270041628},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":845354,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":847000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276653714},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":845354,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":847000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283143272},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":845354,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":847000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286877554}],"funded_date":"2012-01-24T12:56:25Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:13:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tricia Kell","image":809712}},{"id":760743,"name":"Roselyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ryan is seventeen years old, female and is the fourth of four children in the family.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Flora is very proud to have responsible and hard-working children who have finished their studies and become successful in their chosen career.  She believes that having them reach their goals in life is the fruit of her sacrifices. <P>\r\n\r\nFlora is engaged in a welding and repair shop business.  Through her income from her shop, she was also able to put up a sari-sari store (community-based store).  She is doing her best to improve her businesses and as much as possible without depending too much on her children because she believes they will also have their own families in the future and it is good for them to start saving money.

Mrs. Maricruz has two children; her daughter works in her neighbourhood selling bread, and her son lives in another city. On Mondays, the Manantiales group sells fruit at a fair, where group members also sell lunch, dinner and second-hand children's clothing. Everyone in the group lives near the fairground. The group has established a base of regular customers, but they know that marketplace competition is stiff. In order to succeed, they need more merchandise, a bigger, better work area, and the necessary credit to make these improvements. They hope to increase their income and improve their families' quality of life. This will be the Manantiales group's third loan; they have always demonstrated determination, honesty, and unity-- all the qualities essential to group solidarity. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She would also like to buy tables, chairs, plates, glasses, and cups to establish her business and make her customers more comfortable. \r\n\r\nPersonally, she feels more independent and responsible with her monthly payments and she knows how to make her own decisions. \r\n\r\nDiana Maria would like to express her gratitude to Manuela Ramos for allowing her to grow as a woman and entrepreneur. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Brittany Thatcher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":288877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase rice, sugar, oils, napkins, tables, chairs, plates, glasses, and cups","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn - San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-03-20T15:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":145.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111836},{"amount":45.94,"local_amount":133.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":146.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36007029},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":145.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590703},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.32,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:25:33Z","rounded_local_amount":145.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52984965},{"amount":45.95,"local_amount":133.68,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":146.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205328},{"amount":45.73,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:48:04Z","rounded_local_amount":145.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73634603}],"funded_date":"2009-03-20T17:03:02Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T18:48:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Thatcher","image":null}},{"id":99575,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is 39 years old and married with no child.

She mostly sells fried peanuts and chips. Helen is happily married to Eduardo T.. The couple is thankful because they are blessed with two children. There is Edwin, who is 24 years old and a college graduate. He now works as an Overseas Foreign Worker (OFW). They also have Joel, who is 20 years old. He is currently in his second year in college and is studying Hotel and Restaurant Management. \r\n<p>\r\nAside from snack vending, Helen sells frozen foods and makes native cakes to help generate more profit to meet her children\u2019s needs. In the future, she hopes to have a permanent vending stall, which would make selling easier and generate more customers. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, Helen does not have enough capital to expand her business. She is therefore requesting a loan amounting to PHP8,000.00 to further achieve her business goals. With the loan she will purchase additional items to sell. She prays to God to give her strength in order to become a successful entrepreneur and to provide a better living for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":318134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

M., pictured second from the right and dressed in white, is the group coordinator for her 5-member group called \"Trabajadores Unidos\", which means \"United Workers\". She is the single mother of three children: a daughter of 22, and two boys ages 18, and 10. They reside in Paraiso Escondido, a small town in the sector of Punta de Villa Mella, in Santo Domingo Norte. Her daughter began studying law last year, her oldest son is a sophomore in high school, and her youngest son is a talented baseball player.\r\n\r\nHer home, along with her previous business, a general store in her home, was swept away when a river flooded near her house last year, taking four other houses with it. As a result, her two oldest children had to stop going school to meet their basic needs. She is starting over now by opening up a similar store from her home, selling general care products and basic medicines.\r\n\r\nGregoria plans to invest in such products as hair-smoothing cream, deodorants, shampoos, medicines, and sandals, which she buys in bulk and says are the products in highest demand. The home she is living in now, Gregoria says, is located in a very strategic business location relative to her town. At the end of this loan, she hopes her store will be firmly reestablished, providing her once more with a steady source of income. With this steady income, she hopes to start saving for her daughter's education, and to be able to pay for her sons' schooling and for the baseball coaching and cleats for her youngest son. She also plans to continue working on finishing her current home, as she has placed 800 out of 1,300 cinder blocks for it so far. Since her business is run from her home, having it completed would allow her business to expand.\r\n\r\nSome of her long-term goals are to be able to pay for her daughter's law school education, and also to be able to continue to encourage and support her youngest son, as they hope he makes it to the big leagues.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":347306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She tells us that now she lives with her parents and two of her brothers.  Ever since she left school she started to work, but since her community is small there are not a lot of job opportunities so she decided to start her own business selling pork meat.  She makes her sales on Wednesdays, but the day before she offers her meat to her friends and neighbors in the community.  The next day, after seasoning the pork, she delivers her orders. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that selling pork is a difficult and arduous business because days before she has to go out to the other towns to buy the pig that she will prepare, and at times it is very difficult to find a pig and she has to go very far from Playa V..  But she is a very tenacious woman, since she has to support her family and also her youngest brother, who has a hurt leg.\r\n\r\nAmada needs this loan to invest in the purchase of pigs, feed and plastic bags to make her sales.

brewed hibiscus flowers, organic blue agave nectar, natural extracts and spices. \r\n\r\nHusband and wife team Esailama and Tyrone were first introduced by Abdoulaye \u201cPapa\u201d Camara, a native from Senegal and one of the founders of the Sengalese National Dance Company. Esailama explains that their mom and pop company is a perfect marriage of her business administration background and her husband\u2019s entrepreneurial skill (he has had a successful line of oils, incense, and shampoos as an herbalist for over a decade). Camara introduced Esailama, a dancer, and Tyrone, a drummer, and was a mainstay in their lives and the New Orleans cultural community for many years. Camara was stranded for many days after Katrina and died from complications caused by cancer not long after being evacuated and returning to his native Senegal. The couple sees their company as part of a cultural and vocational heritage he bequeathed to them. Six years after Katrina, some of Tyrone\u2019s family are still displaced. Esailama explains that the company melds together family traditions and culture, and their product includes spices that have been passed down in the family for many generations.  \r\n\r\n\u201cBissap\u201d is a West African word for \u201chibiscus.\u201d In many cultures globally, the hibiscus is valued for its medicinal properties. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, the Bissap Breeze product can be used as a tea, in cooking, or as a cocktail mix. The company launched its first product sales of Bissap Breeze at the French Market during Jazz Fest weekend earlier this year, and the company has rapidly expanded. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of each bottle are used to support the performing arts and ensure that the cultural legacy of dance and music live on in New Orleans.  \r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan will be used to purchase organic agave, the most expensive ingredient in the product, as well as for marketing expenses and working capital.  \u201cWe\u2019re not just out to make a product,\u201d says Esailama, \u201cbut to us this is about creating something that is life-giving.\"

When she began, she sold sweets that she made herself, as well as towels. Later, she secured a place to sell in the area near the Market of Grenada.

She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Djidjoho of Hetin Sota, situated near the hot springs of Dangbo. She also sells rice. <P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land. <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Sidonie H. has requested a loan of 120,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":237937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-12T21:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sidonie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821568},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357837},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046887},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938505},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396170},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":32250.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904048},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:02Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126056}],"funded_date":"2008-12-12T22:54:50Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83207,"name":"Fouvale","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fouvale F., 25, is married with 1 child.

She lives with her only daughter, 17, who is studying for a technical career.   She set up a small store in her house where she sells basic foods (eggs, noodles, rice, milk, and bread, etc.) and drinks.  She has been doing this for a period of nine months.  She works in the store all day every day.  What she likes about the business is that through the business she gets to connect with a lot of people, and she wins many customers due to her good attention.  Also, she feels useful.  Being the only store in the region, it is very profitable.  She has also been selling beauty products for the past six months.  \r\n\r\nIn the future Adela would like to build a place for a mini market, which would help her neighbors with their daily purchases.  Her region is very far from the market.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  What she likes most about working with her communal bank is that all of the members support each other.

She is not married because her fianc\u00e9 became sick and died before their wedding, leaving her pregnant with their baby. Even though she must support her five-year-old daughter alone, she is determined to provide a good future for her child. \r\n<p>\r\nLeft alone to fend for her baby girl, Gena decided to establish her own business with the help of start-up capital from her mother so that she could support her young daughter and herself. As she moved on with her life, the pain of losing her child's father lessened, especially as she busied herself with building her general store and raising her daughter.\r\n<p>\r\nAs her business slowly grew, Gena saw new opportunities for expansion. In 2006 she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could add to her capital and expand her business. The loans she received from NWTF-Project Dungganon enabled her to diversify into food vending, including selling frozen food in her general store. The business now earns an average monthly income of 10,000 PHP, which she uses for household expenses and in savings for her daughter's future. The rest she plows back into the business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn her eighth loan cycle she borrowed 19,500 PHP to add to her revolving working capital. She was able to pay back the weekly installments on time and in full within the loan term. Now Gena is requesting a loan of 21,000 PHP for her ninth cycle. With it she intends to increase her inventory a little more so that she can build her savings for the future security of her small family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through its alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a dollar a day to achieving realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live lives that they can finally call honorable ones. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":395704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 40 years old. Evangeline is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Evangeline operates a family member's service-based business providing manicure and pedicure services in the local community. Evangeline has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Evangeline joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Evangeline is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This will be the first loan taken out by Evangeline from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":472797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

For five years, he has been engaged in the making and sale of chicha (a traditional drink of Peru).  He tells us that he learned how to make this drink from his parents since he helped them with this business when he was young.  Now, he is preparing his own chicha and selling it to his own customers.  He uses the income that he gets from this business for his personal expenses and to support his family.\r\n<p>\r\nChicha is a traditional drink of the entire country.  It is made from a variety of corn and a great deal is consumed by people who live in rural areas since it gives them energy needed to continue working.\r\n<p>\r\nJos\u00e9 wants to expand his business by purchasing raw materials used to make his product, especially firewood and charcoal (chicha is prepared in kitchens using firewood and charcoal) since, due to the spring rainy season, charcoal and firewood have become scarce.  This is why he is applying for the first time for a loan of 1000 new soles from Edpyme Alternativa.  He wants to use the loan to reach his objective.  Jos\u00e9 is a very hard working and optimistic young man.  His greatest wishes are to continue growing as a businessman and to support his parents when they need him.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":500120,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"The purchase of raw materials for making chicha","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La Union -

This school was founded in 2006 by Joko C.R. V., to cater for under-privileged youths in the community. Currently, the school is staffed with twenty-three teachers and has an enrollment of 545 pupils.   \r\n\r\nThese hard-working and dedicated teachers have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org to seek a loan of SLL 7,400,000. With the help of this loan, these teachers can embark on some meaningful project that their mere salaries alone can not do. Some of them will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to buy house-building materials; some buy a piece of land or pay school fees for their children, while others will invest the loan in business. \r\n\r\nJoko C.R. V. is the leader of this group of teachers. Born in a village called Rotifunk, Joko is today residing in Waterloo together with his wife and five children. His wife is a businesswoman and three of his children are attending primary and secondary schools. Mr. V., who has served in the teaching profession for thirty years, would like to use his share of this loan to buy house-building materials in order to complete his house-building project. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":629502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy house-building materials ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Waterloo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2010-11-02T15:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joko C.

The official name of this borrowing group is Prescilla E..\r\n\r\nPrescilla is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Prescilla owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Prescilla has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Prescilla joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Prescilla has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Prescilla is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Prescilla from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

He separated with his wife a number of years ago and his five children are already grown up and working. This enterprising man makes a living in construction. Since he was a young man he learned from watching his relatives who worked in the trade. Currently he has a construction company, and although he lacks a few permits he manages with three other workers. He oversees them since he is the master builder. He really enjoys his work and says it is heartwarming to see the big jobs completed with good results. It's for this reason he has various clients who recommend him, and he doesn't lack for work since he is always starting or completing construction. For the future, he plans on purchasing a pickup truck so that his workers can move around without problems. This is his fifth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he promises to make his payments on time since he doesn't want to be in bad standing with the people who made this support possible and so that he can continue working in search of progress. Abraham plans to invest the loan in the purchase of a cement mixing machine since it is an instrument he is missing in order to finish his jobs more quickly, and he calculates that he will earn better profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":700776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a cement mixing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-27T04:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abraham ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":199.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":219.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":220.95},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":228.68},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":234.16},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":244.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":251.49},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":260.6},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":271.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":278.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":291.32},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":298.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.03},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.62},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.02},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.85},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.85},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.79},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.22},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.55},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.24},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.81},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.15,"local_amount":221.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":224.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887259},{"amount":81.16,"local_amount":221.35,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":224.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327620},{"amount":86.06,"local_amount":234.72,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":238.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196155},{"amount":95.3,"local_amount":259.91,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":264.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269832},{"amount":94.92,"local_amount":258.86,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":263.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549853},{"amount":166.85,"local_amount":455.05,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":462.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665792},{"amount":175.99,"local_amount":479.96,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":487.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244620966},{"amount":318.57,"local_amount":868.82,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":882.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257244998}],"funded_date":"2011-01-27T14:07:07Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":272527,"name":"Oem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oem S., age 21, is a mother blessed with a small child.

She has two years of experience in this business.    \r\n\r\nFiapito needs a loan of 1500 WST to purchase additional fabrics and supplies.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 350 WST or about $146 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Fiapito joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Fiapito's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Today, she keeps bulls in her household, and sales of meat products allows the family to earn about 9,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further expand her business, Kanymbu requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase additional heads of livestock for fattening up and resale.

In the long term she would like to be able to sell other products to gain more income and customers and to remain in good health to be able to provide an education for her daughter.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Donald Allen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":216828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Repair of roof and sewer drain","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-11-06T02:50:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza  Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-20T10:19:17Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":608.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893420},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":608.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816497},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":608.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351202},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":608.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038524},{"amount":30.55,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:44:06Z","rounded_local_amount":608.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928825},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":608.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383751},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":608.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890235},{"amount":30.57,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":608.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111561},{"amount":30.52,"local_amount":555.52,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":608.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73532999}],"funded_date":"2008-11-06T10:19:17Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T09:44:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Donald Allen","image":null}},{"id":75031,"name":"Mpoki N.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Tanzania!

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":227682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more crops in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-20T20:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mpoki N.

Her greatest expense at the end of the month is mainly school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nShe also sells grasshoppers, during their season, at the market. She works seven days a week and she pays rent for the place she works. Pauline normally receives about 10 people a day, both men and women. She sells her products on a retail basis, and has been in this business for over 10 years.\r\n\r\nPauline complains of the very expensive transportation from the villages where she purchases her goods. And the grasshoppers only come seasonally, which is twice a year. She has worked with MCDT for six years now and she chose to work with MCDT because of the school fees loan they give to their clients. She will use this loan to increase her stock and she also hopes to educate her grandchildren until they graduate from university.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":277933,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

Each person has invested the loans they have received throughout the years in their businesses, though with different objectives. Rosa B., for example, is the mother of two children who are 10 and 3 years old. Four years ago, she started a food cart business with money her husband gave her. She started this business because of economic hardship; the money her husband earned was not enough for household needs. \nAt the beginning, Rosa would take out on credit the supplies she needed, and at the end of the day, she would pay the store back with what she earned selling \"cachangas\" (large flat bread), coffee, and fried chicken. Rosa's efforts, her nice manner, and her desire to succeed led to more customers.\nWith the loans she received, she has bought plates, cups, silverware, benches, and a tent. This business has helped Rosa a lot, since it has allowed her to buy shoes, clothes and school supplies for her little ones, and to pay for basic household needs. \nShe needs the new loan because she wants to buy a kitchen table and to repair the tent, which has deteriorated after much use.\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":417264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Repairing\/supplying business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:57Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3850,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Elvira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria Nicolasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Romulo Jorge ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessenia Mariela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina Elifia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fortunata Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Elvira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario Consuelo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":962.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":962.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":962.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":962.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":962.5,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2800.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780219},{"amount":962.5,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2800.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669092},{"amount":962.5,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2800.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064551},{"amount":962.5,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2800.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899611}],"funded_date":"2009-11-29T23:42:29Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Violeta Rubiani","image":null}},{"id":153017,"name":"Tessie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tessie O. is from the municipality of Manticao in Misamis Oriental province on the island of Mindanao.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need. To learn more about IMON International's work, please visit: www.imon.tj\r\n\r\nLoan has been repaid successfully \r\n\r\nTillaeva Mehriniso is thankful to Kiva and all the lenders. With the loan she increased the number of her medicine in her drug store that helped her to make her drug store more famous. Mehriniso said, with the profit, she repaired the family house and improved her family living. She is looking forward for more loans from Kiva to further expand her business. Mehriniso thanks once again everyone who supported her as exactly your timely assistance allowed her developing her business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":592616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"Expanding the business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Dushanbe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.56 68.773889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2010-08-30T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dodaroy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":738.32},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":755.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":773.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":791.21},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":809.68},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":828.57},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":847.9},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":867.69},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":887.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.41},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.36},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.4},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.55},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.55},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.09},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":165.15,"local_amount":719.74,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":723.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172276457},{"amount":170.04,"local_amount":741.05,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T10:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":744.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177695975},{"amount":184.98,"local_amount":806.24,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:54:03Z","rounded_local_amount":810.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182857155},{"amount":170.32,"local_amount":742.3,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-20T09:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":746.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189271796},{"amount":185.58,"local_amount":808.81,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":813.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191448057},{"amount":201.55,"local_amount":878.35,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-17T08:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":883,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196136697},{"amount":388.89,"local_amount":1694.85,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1703.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201310856},{"amount":208.49,"local_amount":908.66,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:52:46Z","rounded_local_amount":913.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206666240}],"funded_date":"2010-08-30T19:15:35Z","paid_date":"2011-05-19T07:52:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Allen","image":1340661}}]}
