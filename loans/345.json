It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The most common livelihood of people in their Barangay is agriculture. Some are into rice planting businesses while others have livestock raising businesses.\r\n\r\nWith Vanjie\u2019s previous loan requested through ASHI, she has been able to start raising cattle and supporting her rice planting business. These are raised just in her wide backyard where the land is covered with green grass and surrounded with rice plants. Once her cattle have been given a period of time to grow, they will be sold and the profit will be as much as double the capital (the same as the rice).\r\n\r\nHowever, incomes in these kinds of businesses are seasonal, as well as the income of her husband, who is a farmer also. That is why Luzviminda thought of the need to have more savings so that she can provide her family with their daily needs. \r\n\r\nThrough ASHI and its partnership with Kiva, Luzviminda would like to request a much larger loan amount to grow her business and to be able to have more profits as well as savings. For her business to be the greatest provider of money for her family, she needs to invest more capital in it.  She hoped that her savings would someday be enough to support the education of her three children, whose ages range from 10 to 19 years old.\r\n\r\nHer eldest child, who no longer goes to school, is working as a cook in one of the fast food restaurants in town.

Minerva needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Minerva joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Minerva's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Minerva Teriki P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Kakamega is the region in Kenya known for production of sugar cane and it is well-known as the sugar-belt region. She sells vegetables, e.g. kale, onions, green vegetables and others, to the local people. She has been doing this business for seven years now and has one employee. \r\n\r\nShe says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is that there are so many other people in the area doing the same kind of business as hers, so customers are not loyal as they are spoiled for choice. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of 30,000 Kenyan shillings to buy more vegetables to expand her business and meet customer demand. She hopes to grow her business to a wholesale one and, in the future, diversify into clothes sales.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be $300WST or US$125 per week) to make improvements to her house.\n\nTalaileva joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Talaileva's 5th loan with SPBD.\n\n\n\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score\". For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

So she wants to help her husband in bringing in extra income by starting a small pig farm in her home.  Despite only using simple pig pen, she could farm several fattening pigs to be later slaughtered.  From this small business profit, Ni Wayan Suatri realized significant benefit to her family's finances.  Each fattening pig, farmed for 6 months, she could earn $66 profit, and it could help pay her child's tuition and save the rest for her old days.  DINARI loans was used to buy more pigs and quality feeds so her product can satisfy customer and increase her profit.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer <\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nDalam usia yang tidak bisa dibilang muda lagi yaitu 42 tahun tidak membuat Ni Wayan Suatri menjadi malas dalam bekerja. Itu bukan saja karena tuntutan hidup, tetapi juga karena rasa tanggung jawabnya atas masa depan seorang anaknya yang masih harus ditanggungnya terutama dalam hal pendidikannya yang baru menginjak tahun pertama Sekolah menengah atas. Ni Wayan Suatri melihat bahwa penghasilan suaminya yang hanya seorang petani dengan penghasilan yang pas-pasan sudah tidak bisa lagi mencukupi keperluan keluarganya, sehingga timbul niatnya untuk membantu suaminya dalam memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya yaitu dengan memelihara ternak babi di rumahnya. Walaupun kandangnya sederhana tapi itu dirasanya sudah cukup untuk bisa memelihara beberapa ekor babi khususnya babi penggemukan.\r\nDari usaha yang digelutinya ini Ni Wayan Suatri merasakan manfaat yang luar biasa terhadap kesejahteraan keluarganya, karena selain memiliki kesibukan setiap harinya, usahanya ini juga bisa memberikan keuntungan walaupun jumlahnya tidak begitu besar. Dari satu ekor babi penggemukan yang dipelihara selama enam bulan bisa menghasilkan keuntungan sekitar  Rp 600.000,- dan itu bisa dipergunakannya untuk membiayai sekolah anaknya dan sebagian kecil disimpannya untuk tabungan di hari tuanya kelak. Pinjaman  yang diperolehnya dari DINARI dipergunakannya untuk menambah jumlah babi penggemukan dan juga pengadaan pakan yang berkualitas supaya hasilnya bisa memuaskan dan meningkatkan keuntungannya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":123584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

Many clients appreciate how responsibly he takes his work:  both in the treatment of their suits and other clothing and the promptness of service.  After eight years in business, he now wants to refurbish his establishment.  For this reason, he approached WAGES to obtain a loan that would allow him to purchase a door with a window, to build a storage area, and acquire an additional clothes dryer and assorted other needed accessories.

Despite the hardships and difficulties of their life, they have strong faith and determination to improve their standard of living through patience and hard work.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a way of earning income, her husband works as a caretaker in Jacintas Hotel and Resort while Jonelyn has a business buying and selling vegetables in their village. She buys vegetables from farmers and sells them at Solano Public Market and also house to house in their village. Her monthly income is 4,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) which they use for their daily needs and for the schooling of their children.

L. is 48 and married with 5 children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Tumama has 3 years of experience in this business.  Tumama needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tumama joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tumama's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tumama L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She lives in the Autopista sector of the Turi parish, which means 'brother' in Quechua. This place is located on a steep hill, where one can enjoy a spectacular view of the city in the afternoon and at night and appreciate the natural beauty of the mountain range that surrounds it. \r\n\r\nOur member is 56 years old and is married with 8 children (31, 30, 29, 27, 24, 22 and 16 years old). 5 of her children are married and live independently. The children who are 27 and 24 are single and worked in a shoe factory and help with the household costs, and her youngest daughter studies in a college in the region. Blanca's husband is a carpenter and she works raising and selling guinea pigs and chickens in her community, giving additional income to cover the necessities of their home, and also for consumption in their home. Thanks to the sacrifices of their mutual work they have been able to have their own home.  \r\n\r\nBlanca has been working with loans from Fundaci\u00f3n for 2 loan cycles, thanks to the invitation from her mother-in-law to become part of this group of empresarial woman, in search of improving her family and personal situation. With the new loan she will purchase guinea pigs to breed and feed to increase her breeding place. Her dream is that sales go well.

","en":"Aizada is 30 years old and married. She and her husband are raising three children, the youngest of whom is four years old. After having graduated from  college with a degree in philology, Aizada started working in the Zhan-Bulak village school, where she still works as an English teacher. In 2003, in the search of an additional source of income for her family, Aizada started raising farm animals. She had 15,000 KGS as her starting capital. At present her farm brings in about 15,000 KGS monthly from sale of milk products. Currently she has four dairy cows, 20 sheep, eight goats and four horses. In order to increase her cattle herd, Aizada turned to  \"Bai Tushum &Partners\" for a loan of 45,000 KGS to buy two young bulls. Aizada plans to use the resulting revenues to purchase additional animals, which will allow her to expand her farm.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To purchase timber in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T02:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema N.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Since he was very young, Daler learned a great deal about sambusa preparation from his mother and that's why he decided to dedicate himself to this work.\r\n\r\nDaler has big plans and dreams to grow his business. His goal is to have his own place where he can offer more comforts to his customers. And he'd like to buy a refrigerator so he can begin to offer cold drinks as well.\r\n\r\nWith this purpose in mind, Daler wants to take a loan of 1,500 USD to purchase the necessary ingredients for preparing sambusa and also to improve his business conditions. He is very motivated to grow his business and increase his income. With his efforts and your important contribution, Daler can reach his goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Occidental. She earns her living through her photography business.\r\n\r\nRosemarie\u2019s husband, Jemmy, who is 44 years old, helps in running the business by going to different schools and by catering different occasions where video or photography is needed.  They have four children between the ages of 6  and 17 years old. The children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nRosemarie joined the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in the photography business. Now she earns an average monthly income of $203 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP was used to fund operations for her photography business, which had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now in her 14th loan cycle, Rosemarie is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use for their photography business.  She is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":484406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Additional

He is 53 years old. Alejandro is married and has 6 adult-aged children. To make a living, Alejandro owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling different kinds of fruits in the local community. Alejandro has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Alejandro joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alejandro has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Alejandro is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Alejandro from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Under this a fire is lit, in one corner of the courtyard outside the house, for at least two or three days.  The fish must be tended to throughout the process.  The smoked fish is then sold door to door and in the markets in Konodimini and Konobougou for cash and on credit, generally to women.\r\n\r\nMadame Azara Sogor\u00e9 hopes to earn with this loan an average monthly profit of 30,000 FCFA to be used to meet the daily needs of her household, as well as to reinvest in her business.

This is the place where the famous paja toquilla [or \"Panama\"] hats come from. \r\n\r\nThis is a group of people who decided to come together, three loan cycles ago, and form this communal bank. It is very helpful for them, since with the loans they have been able to improve their standard of living and finance their businesses more effectively. Most of the members of this bank work creating handicrafts, above all paja toquilla products. Some are also involved in trade in general. \r\n\r\nIn this place, we meet Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas, who is 33 years old. She is married, and from this relationship she has two daughters, aged 11 and 7, who are in elementary school. Her husband is an artisan. For her this is the fourth loan cycle in the communal bank. She likes it because of the help the institution gives its members. \r\n\r\nShe is an artisan and works making and selling paja toquilla hats. She works every day, and she reports that it is a profession she loves, since her creations are not only part of a continuing tradition that is many years old, but also are admired in many parts of Ecuador and the rest of the world. She learned this profession from her parents, and they learned it from her grandparents. She has worked in this area for some 20 years, and she does it together with her husband, who also weaves hats. Once the hats are semi-finished, they are sold to businesspeople who arrive in the Pampas area to buy from the artisans and take the products to other cities. \r\n \r\nThis loan is to buy paja toquilla to make the hats.\r\n\r\nHer dream is that her children will have a good future.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.  This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.  Where a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":111832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of clothing in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-01-09T02:44:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thereza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-23T03:17:03Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-02-23T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":54188,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140924},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-03-23T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":54188,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164587},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":54188,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189685},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":54188,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217748},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":54188,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246727},{"amount":45,"local_amount":49090.91,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":53010,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":275276}],"funded_date":"2008-01-09T03:17:03Z","paid_date":"2008-07-23T09:16:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":34660,"name":"Aan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aan D., 29, is married to Roni and has 2 children.

Most people probably see their business as a mean to achieve something, but Margalena also sees her business as a passion. Over 20 years ago, she started a beauty salon in her own house and in the front of her house she has a small frituria - which means that she fries a variety of foods for sale.  About 4 years ago she also started to buy and sell clothes and natural products like medicine and drinks. Sometimes she is so busy with everything she is involved in that her husband and friends help her out. \"I simply love to do business,\" she says.<P>\r\n\r\nSan Marcos is a poor neighborhood, but the participants in the group think their economy has improved lately and that loans from Esperanza are one important reason for this improvement. It is no wonder that they have chosen Margalena as their coordinator. She is energetic and the one that has the most experience running a business.<P>\r\n\r\nWith her upcoming loan, Margalena wants to expand her businesses, in particular she wants to sell more clothes. By being responsible with her loan, her businesses, family, group, and neighborhood will have more opportunity to

In the past few years, they lived in Mountain Province, Philippines. But now, they came to settle for good in Barangay Del Pilar, where there are more livelihood opportunities. They were blessed with five children, namely; Enrique, 21 years old, a college graduate and an account officer in a banking corporation; Winnielyn, a domestic helper abroad who, at her young age of 19, also helps her husband with their family; Phoebe, 8 years old, now entering the second grade in the primary level; and the youngest, Valerie, 2 years old. The family is a God-fearing one. Magdalena envisions bringing her family closer to God for she believes in this Bible passage: \u201cTrust in the Lord and He will direct your path.\u201d\r\n\r\nMadalena manages a store in their current village retailing gasoline, lubricants (for automobiles), and \u201cbagoong\u201d (a type of kitchen spice) for almost 11 years. Her weekly income from the business has an average of PHP1,000, which is not enough to support the education of her children since they don\u2019t have other sources of income. She would like to receive a loan amounting to PHP5,000 to add to her business revolving capital. She plans to also purchase  some bottled drinks and snacks to increase her weekly income to meet all her family\u2019s necessities. Magdalena is hoping and praying that some day their living situation will become progressive by working hard and motivating her family members to work together in combating life\u2019s difficulties.

Sebucao, San Enrique, Negros Occidental, Ananita is not only working for the present needs of her family by helping supplement the income of her husband, she is also making plans for her old age.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, Ananita started a general store which provides a steady income for her family. In addition, she also started raising pigs in her backyard and she used the profits from the pig raising to capitalize on a third business venture - direct selling of a networking product. From these three business activities, she earns an average amount of PHP 6,000 per month, which is enough to cover the college expenses of her only child, and the balance she plowed back into her business. She manages her cash flow well and was able to pay off her last loan of PHP 12,000 without missing a payment.\r\n\r\nNow, for her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ananita is borrowing another PHP 12,000 so that she can continue expanding the operations of her three business activities. She is very thankful that she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon because it has made a big difference in her family's quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

She also takes care of additional family members. She resides in and owns a three-roomed house where she lives with six people. The family has access to electricity and piped water and gets three meals a day. Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding the family and school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nKasifa works in a semi-urban area which is in the outskirts of Kampala. She incurs transport costs to and from her work in Nakawa market. She has a stall selling yellow bananas and buys from her place of work from suppliers who get them from the villages. She doesn\u2019t pay rent for her business but pays daily market dues of 800 UGX per day worked.\r\n\r\nKasifa works seven days a week. She receives an average of ten customers a day and sells to all categories of people both in retail and wholesale. Her major business challenges are defaulters and the rainy season which hinders her from reaching her customers.\r\n\r\nKasifa has been in this business for twenty years and with MCDT for nine years and is servicing her thirtieth loan, working with the same group members. Kasifa joined MCDT because it was near her home and it was working with poor women. She wants to use this loan to buy more bunches and clusters of yellow bananas.\r\n\r\nKasifa is aspiring to seeing her business grow bigger and to start selling wholesale only and also to getting permanent business premises.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":437046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The rest live by themselves and work in the city. When she was very young she learned the farming techniques necessary for a productive harvest. It is for this reason that she currently plants peas, potatoes, corn and other vegetables. She says that she likes this work a lot because she works with her son and together they keep watch of the crops every day starting at sun rise. She says that the reward of her constant labor is to watch during harvest time since she gets good quality fresh products which she sells at regular prices to the wholesalers who come from the city. The part she doesn't like is the many times is when they don't treat her crops adequately and the crops are infected with plagues of insects. She sadly remembers one time when she lost almost all of her products for this reason. As she is a very enterprising woman who always thinks about the future, she already has a plan to plant in larger quantities to increase her earnings. This is the third time she has gotten a loan with MFP and she is very thankful to all the people who maD. this loan possible and allowed her to continue progressing. Also, she feels very satisfied with the work of her communal group because all the members are very organized and responsible. Zenovia plans on investing the loan she is requesting in buying pea and potato seeds. Also for this season she hopes to contract workers to produce in larger quantities and, in this way, she hopes to progress. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Fanning, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":586243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy pea and potato seeds and contract workers to help with planting","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-19T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenovia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":839.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463120}],"funded_date":"2010-08-20T00:20:19Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Fanning","image":null}},{"id":228078,"name":"Aly","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Aly S. est mari\u00e9 \u00e0 une femme et est  p\u00e8re de 6 enfants (3gar\u00e7ons et 3 filles).

She has lived in the house of her in in-laws for 25 years.  The house is in one of the liveliest and friendliest neighborhoods of the city where traditional street music frames the everyday life of the inhabitants.  It was there, 7 years ago, that Mireya decided to set up her business selling the kinds of products that her neighbors wanted.  Before that, she helped her sister run a similar business buying products from catalogs and reselling them.  When Mireya struck out on her own, she knew her market and how to run a business.  She sold products that she bought from catalogs and was eventually put in charge of a sales team.  She was a successful leader and received prizes for her management of the team.  She sold cosmetics, decorative products and even small appliances, as well as clothing and footwear.  The earnings from the business have provided her with an independent income.  Mireya normally sells on credit and she can't always stretch her income to cover new orders, so she's applying to Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo for a loan, her third, so that has the working capital she needs to support the business.

She also likes the meetings, where she relaxes and learns from the educational topics.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":883257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy sweets and a motorcycle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2011-10-16T16:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lady Mirian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":370.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":387.73},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":405.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":425.04},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":445.01},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":465.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.02},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.46},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.21},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.26},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.02,"local_amount":370.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":373.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238659674},{"amount":143.46,"local_amount":387.73,"processed_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":390.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244613783},{"amount":150.21,"local_amount":405.96,"processed_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":409.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250828974},{"amount":157.26,"local_amount":425.04,"processed_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-29T08:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":428.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257239066},{"amount":164.66,"local_amount":445.01,"processed_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-24T07:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":448.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263378539},{"amount":172.39,"local_amount":465.93,"processed_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":469.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270092264}],"funded_date":"2011-10-28T16:15:01Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:20:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":351049,"name":"An","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"An is 38 years old and has 3 children who are attending school.

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":123692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-02-02T19:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rehema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-16T21:12:58Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":53682,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159453},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":53682,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":184275},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":53682,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211878},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":53682,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":240047},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-07-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":53682,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":268958},{"amount":45,"local_amount":49090.91,"processed_date":"2008-08-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":52515,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":298074}],"funded_date":"2008-02-02T21:12:58Z","paid_date":"2008-08-16T09:16:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":38772,"name":"Kireka B3 B Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The group leader of this small group is Sarah N..

She started he business in 2002, selling second-hand clothing. In time and with improving circumstances, she was able to transform her business into a shop and terrace.  Given her ambitions to expand her business and fulfill the projects she has for her home, Mado decided to gain steady financial support through loans from Hope since 2008. \n\nThe next loan she is requesting will enable her to purchase various items, such as jams, sacks of rice, sugar, milt and other items to strengthen the stock of merchandise in her shop. Her hard work, as well as her great management are the \"trump card\" for her business - the reason it prospers. \n\nMado is married and the mother of 6 children whose ages range from 3 to 15.

Several years ago, Kerezbu left for Russia as a migrant worker. Hard work and determination helped her save her earnings and upon returning home, she started her own business. She is a mother to and has raised four children.  Her eldest daughter is married and lives separately. Her elder son is still working in Russia. Her middle son does odd jobs at the local market and her little daughter, 26, helps her in the business. Some people believe that the active part of your life ends once your children become grown\u2013ups, and you can quietly meet an old age and have rest. That\u2019s not the case with Kerezbu. Moreover, having received Kerezbu\u2019s upbringing, her children know that there is no free cheese in this world. Kerezbu has preferred to be active and not depend on them. Instead, she is a great example of a strong independent woman. Kerezbu\u2019s business is trade in women\u2019s underwear, night gowns, pajamas and T\u2013shirts. From her earnings, she invested around $715 to purchase goods. Now her current monthly income is $120. Her Russian experience is helping her to survive and be competitive. Kerezbu needs a loan to purchase goods for fall and winter seasons and increase her range of goods. Her immediate plans are to save money to buy a car for her middle son and marry her little daughter. \r\n<p>\r\nKerezbu\u2019s partners: Aida, Asel and Uulkan. Aida, 36, has three children. She plans to start her own business of running a shop. She hopes to obtain a loan as she wants to purchase foodstuffs, drinks, cereals and sugar.\r\n<p>\r\nAsel, 26, has one child. Together with her husband, she sells socks at a local market. They need a loan to buy a milk cow for breeding and for milk. \r\n<p>\r\nUulkan, 22, is married. She sells various kinds of jackets. Her husband and his brother help her transport the goods. Uulkan has applied for this loan because she needs to purchase new goods and increase the assortment. \r\n<p>\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<p>\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

He is married and lives with his wife and two children. The older is five and the younger six months. His instructional level is primary school. He is a salaried employee of a construction company based in Kigali. He is a workman in that company. Since where he lives is a bit rural, he grows sorghum, beans, and manioc, used to feed the family, and as for his wife, she oversees the farming.\r\n\r\nJean Paul has had more than 10 loans from ACB and with these loans, he has bought a house. The prior loans have allowed him to become economically independent. Today, he is taking out a loan of 320,000 Rwandan Francs to repair his house, kitchen, and toilet by buying sand, cement, two interior doors for his house and kitchen, then to build a roof and pavement, in order to maintain the value of his house and to make it strong, so that he can comfortably continue his work, as he puts it. His ambition is to reimburse his loan in a timely manner so that the Bank will accord him a big loan to use to buy a cow who will produce offspring to raise, and milk and manure. \r\n\r\nIn the future he hopes to improve living conditions for his family (put his children in school and feed them and his wife well). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

B.  is a 37 year old gentleman who lives with his wife and four children on a reserve inhabited by one of the largest indigenous groups in Costa Rica known as the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Guaym%C3%AD\" target=\"_blank\" >Guaym\u00ed<\/a>. The reserve is located in San Vito de Coto Brus, an area known for its elevation and being located an hour away from La Amistad International Park. The main business activities are agriculture and handicrafts. Tourism has increased within the last few years.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Antonio is known as one of the most active and most hospitable members of this community.  One of his wishes is to see tourism continue to grow in his community.  For this reason, he built a house and bought some horses that he could rent to visitors at a good price.  At the moment, the house does not have any beds or furniture.  He needs a loan of 200,000 CRC to buy mattresses, chairs, and linens to equip his rental house so that he can make it available to tourists.  Antonio says his business has many benefits and will contribute to the growth of tourism in his community, as well as generate more income for him and his family.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Antonio is a member of Ku Kwata Communal Credit Enterprise, one of the 100 member organizations that make up EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his first loan and he is very pleased with this opportunity.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":586298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tourism","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"Purchase equipment for his rental cottage","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Puntarenas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":127,"posted_date":"2010-08-20T09:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":64.48,"local_amount":32239.9,"processed_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":32524.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172246263},{"amount":68.85,"local_amount":34426.76,"processed_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":34730.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177391303},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":133333.34,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":134509.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529623}],"funded_date":"2010-08-20T19:05:14Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":228094,"name":"Zaituna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zaituna N. is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kasubi in the Kampala region of Uganda.

With the help of the loan from BRAC, Zaituna hopes to generate greater profits and buy food and home materials for her family. In the future, she hopes to own her own cosmetics shop.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nThese loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age, improve their prospects for the future and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":593815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

He says as a young man he began working with his uncle manufacturing bricks.  In addition, he never had the opportunity to study and earn a college degree.\r\n<p>\r\nAs time passed, Alcides later became the owner of a factory where bricks are made from clay and baked in an oven.  The money he used to buy the factory enabled him to continue working with his uncle on a daily basis.

The nature of his business requires additional working capital but he just requested Php 5,000 for a start. Such an amount is big enough to add up to his revolving capital. He works hard and strives to improve his business in order to achieve his goals in life.

This is 30-year-old Ester M. from Tukuyu. She is married with three children between the ages of 6 and 11. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because her parents cannot take care of her. \r\n\r\nEster has been running a business selling crops since 1997. Her business is to purchase maize, beans, rice and wheat from villages and sell them in town at higher price. She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Ester currently earns about 300USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more maize, rice, wheat and beans in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of her business. Ester thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":255775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She lives in the house of an uncle who has supported her since she arrived in Juliaca from her native Arapa (Department of Puno). What she would like most is to forge a good future. Still young, she has started a business that is giving good results. She has a restaurant that is very popular for meals in her neighborhood. The seasonings that she puts on her food and the friendly service that she offers are her principal means of attracting customers. What she likes best is to cook and hear the compliments that she receives from her customers. She has worked in this for one year, and the most difficult for her is to have to alone serve everyone that comes to the restaurant. In the near future, she hopes to expand her business and improve her income so that she can get ahead. This is the first loan that Yovana has taken with the MFP.

Al has been engaged in his business for 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Al joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Al has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Al is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Al from PMPC.
