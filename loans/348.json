He was born in Magburaka town, Tonkolili District, in northern Sierra Leone. Abdul is married to a businesswoman and the two have four children. Three of his children are in primary school and one is in secondary school. Abdul runs a video center (a cinema with several 19\u201d televisions) where he shows movies and European soccer matches.   People of all ages come to watch Premier League, FA Cup, Carling Cup and European Championship Cup matches.  Once in a while, he\u2019ll also televise the German, Spanish and Italian league games.  He has never received a loan from SMT before, but is now applying for one to help him strengthen his business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Abdul will make a great improvement to his operation. Currently, he is using two satellite dishes, but this is not enough. These dishes cannot show all of the above-mentioned matches. Abdul will therefore add some of his own savings to the money from the loan to buy a new satellite dish that can show all of the above-mentioned matches. He will travel to Freetown, about 240 miles round trip, to buy it. \r\n\r\nNot having the third dish has been Abdul\u2019s greatest challenge in his business. Many customers deserted him because of his inability to show all of the matches. But with this loan, and the dish that he\u2019ll be able to buy, he is optimistic that he will be able to regain all of his lost customers and even find some new ones. Many of the youths in town prefer his video center to others because of its convenient location in the center of town. In addition to having a good location, he is young and many youth like patronizing with him because of their similarities. Also, as chairman of the Motorbike Rider\u2019s Association, he is very popular among the many motorbike riders.\r\n\r\nWhen business improves for Abdul, he will be able to take good care of his family, pay school fees, and provide them with more food and clothing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":238976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Entertainment","sector":"Entertainment","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"buying a third satellite dish for his video center","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Magburaka, Tonkolili","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":243243,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885067},{"amount":144,"local_amount":426666.66,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":432431.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128909},{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":222222.22,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":225225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025698},{"amount":186,"local_amount":551111.12,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":558558.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008502},{"amount":39.01,"local_amount":115555.54,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":117116.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230844},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222222.22,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":225225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662616},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222222.24,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":225225.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102851}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T17:20:06Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:15:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":83655,"name":"B\u00e9atrice","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"A.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mrs. C\u1eady has participated in the TYM Fund since 2005. Before she joined the Fund, her family depended upon fishing for their income.  Since joining the Fund, she has used her loans to invest in a business selling bamboo.  This business is now doing rather well and earns the family an income of 3,000,000 VND (172 USD)  per month.  In the next round of lending, she hopes to borrow 20,000,000 VND (1150 USD) to buy more bamboo, which they can sell to residents of the local community.  This will enable Mrs. C\u1eady and her family to increase their income.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

But being a very optimistic person, she considered it as a chance to start a new life. \r\n\r\nWith the sum of 10,000 Kyrgyz soms (KGS), Uulbu began her business of selling linen and belts. She worked hard and managed to buy a flat for her small family. In order to enlarge the assortment of goods, in 2008, Uulbu obtained her first loan of 80,000 KGS from Bai Tushum and Partners. This loan was used as intended and repaid without any delays. \r\n\r\nHer activity started to bring permanent profit and the number of customers increased. This fact lead Uulbu to take her second loan from Bai Tushum and Partners, which was also used to enlarge her business.\r\n\r\nBut in June 2010, when violent clashes caused by a deposed political regime broke out in the city of Osh, Uulbu lost her business, which was robbed and looted. But Uulbu, being an optimistic and hardworking person, didn\u2019t give up and decided to resume her lost business and continue activities. \r\n\r\nFor this very reason, Uulbu is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her business.

As he did not have the funds he needed to be able to continue with his university education, he started a business selling CDs, cassettes, and DVDs.

She sells clothing items in one of the busiest markets in Ivano-Frankivsk. She owns three vending facilities and has three hired employees who work for her. The inventory she sells is of very high quality. Even though her prices are a little higher than average, Mariya has gained many loyal customers who keep coming back to buy clothes from her.  \r\n<p>\r\nMariya has been in business for 10 years. The twenty-four loans she has received and promptly repaid with Nadiya Ukraine have promoted consistent increase in her sales and profits. Currently, she has around $8,000 of working capital. Her net profit is about $2,000 every month. \r\n<p>\r\nMariya has requested a loan for $1,200 to help open her fourth vending kiosk and expand her trade as a result. Her daughter just had her first baby and Mariya is enjoying her responsibilities as a grandma.

At the same time, the salary is not enough to cover all of the family expenses. In 2005 Gulchar borrowed $500 to add to her own savings of $250 and purchased another milk cow. Since January 2006, prices have doubled and Gulchar applied for a loan of $600 from Normicro to purchase two calves for meat production and expanded her business.

from Dar es Salaam! This is 27 year-old Marim S.. She is married with one 4 year old child. In 2000 Marim established a livestock business. Marim has already received and successfully repaid two loans from SELFINA, and now requires a loan of $875 in order to purchase additional cows and chickens. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nRaising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. Who or what are \u2018kuku\u2019, you may ask. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. \r\n\r\nFirstly, they require little start-up capital, you can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow.\r\n\r\n<b>About SELFINA<\/b><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania, where customs and traditions normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets. Because they lack tangible collateral assets, women are considered not creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low income. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through <i><b>Micro Leasing<\/b><\/i> as a practical way to achieve economic and social emancipation of women. SELFINA buys equipment and leases it to women. When a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from her, extending her a loan, and then leases the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called \"sale and leaseback\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":110521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Her life partner works for himself. Her goal for her business is to always stay active so that the number of customers won\u2019t drop off, since they are crucial to her business. Her hope is that her children will be able to run this business so that in the future they will have some income. Her dreams are to have another business with a variety of products to offer to her customers, and also to live long enough to see this happen.\r\n\r\nFrancisca has a video game business. It is located in her house, at the following address: to the north of the Guadalupe church, 75 varas [unit of distance measurment] to the west. Francisca has had this business for 2 years. This is how she became involved in it--it came about because of the need to deal with the economic situation and because of her dwindling ability to buy basic food items. It was Francisca\u2019s children who thought of the idea. They have Playstations, Mario cars, and other video games. Most of their neighbors have children, so Francisca decided to to buy more video game equipment to start her business in her house. As time has gone by, she has become more well-known. The loan is for working capital to improve the servcies she offers and also to improve the equipment she has so that she can offer the best quality in games. These are expensive and she has to travel to Managua to purchase them.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

He lives in his own house, and what he most desires is to be able to afford higher education for his two beloved sons. \r\n\r\nHis life hasn\u2019t been easy: ever since he was very young, he has always tried to work hard and provide for his family the comforts that he never had. He currently works as a bricklayer, and he is much sought after by his neighbours since he has been doing very good work for more than ten years. Enrique enjoys building walls and putting roofs on houses, and he feels that his work contributes to the development of the neighbourhood. For this reason he is planning to start a new venture--laying hardwood flooring, an activity that will help him to earn more money.\r\n\r\nIn his view the most difficult part of his current job is carrying the heavy wooden planks, and his body is now not as strong as it used to be. Enrique is very pleased to have the opportunity to get a loan with Kiva partner, MFP, and he is certain that the will be able to make all his repayments on time. He is a much-admired member of the community bank as he is very responsible and respectful. With the S\/.1000 loan he will buy a floor-polishing machine so that he can begin work on this new activity. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":327466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy a polishing machine for hardwood floors","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-04T00:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":116.9,"local_amount":334,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:40Z","rounded_local_amount":353.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990663},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:07Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211774},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641300},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080738},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":174.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996879}],"funded_date":"2009-06-04T05:57:57Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":116439,"name":"Rosa Argentina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa argentina Mart\u00ednez S. tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad.

","en":"Rafaela de los \u00c1ngeles is 41 years old.  Her work is clothing sales.  It has been more than 5 years since she began this ambulatory business.  She began to sell because she was as ingle mother and she had to support her two children.  Because of this she decided to take the initiative to begin selling a variety of clothing.

She lives in her own house with her two children: 12 year-old Karen and 6 year-old Cristian, who are the motivation for all of her efforts.  For Mery, the business of selling clothes has been an activity which has allowed her to obtain the necessary income to maintain her family.  Specifically, she sells polos, which she buys from an important market in her city to bring them to sell at her work, since she also works cleaning a hospital.  What she likes the most about her work is conversing with her customers.  She has been doing this for two years and she considers the most difficult thing is to have to bring the garments to her work, as the bundles weigh a lot.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  fish vending and pig fattening. Her husband, Francisco, who is 60 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 22 and 27 years old. \r\n\r\nJuliana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Juliana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $187, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use for additional capital for the fish vending business so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Juliana is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 28 years old. Geraldine is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Geraldine C.'s Group.\r\n\r\nGeraldine is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Geraldine owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Geraldine has been engaged in her business for more than six years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Geraldine joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Geraldine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Geraldine is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Geraldine from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her experiences in her own life - being an adopted child and unrecognized by most of her family members because her parents were poor - pushed her to soar high and be brave in surmounting the challenges she encounters for her own family. Roberto, Diana's husband understood his wife's emotional struggle because they share a common experience. Both of them belonged to a very poor family and have almost fallen or drifted from the real world because of too much insecurity. However, when they both met and got married they found their strength in each other. Diana felt quite secure having her loving and understanding husband beside her. \r\n\r\nWhen Diana had two children, she gained more strength to fight the battles she is facing - financial, and emotional battles. When they started having their own family, she and her husband had no stable job nor source of income. Life then was so hard for both of them, especially for Diana. When ASHI came to their village Diana's clear vision of tomorrow started to flourish. She saw the bright future for her children waiting ahead of her when she received a loan from ASHI. Since then, Diana and her husband have been venturing into several kinds of business, searching for their success. However, life seemed to be cruel for them, she said, yet giving up was far from her thoughts.\r\n\r\nEventually, Diana found her happiness in life. She was elected as member representative to the Board by ASHI members in Antique, Philippines. Her eldest son graduated from college and was a scholar of a state university. Her second child is in high school and is very active in church. For these things she achieved, Diana was so thankful for the loan she obtained from ASHI because she had the opportunity to enhance the agricultural skills she learned from her husband as well as her commercial skills from being a commerce student when she was in college.\r\n\r\nNow, Diana and her husband are farming three hectares (7.5 acres) of rice field. Rice production (planting of rice) is one of their businesses as well as tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) for hire. Diana has her own tricycle and her rice production business generates employment in their community during planting season. She hires laborers to work with them in the field.\r\n\r\nAside from her rice production business and tricycle for hire, Diana plans to venture in the buying and selling of rice and also a motorcycle-for-hire business. This loan will be used for these things.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":348570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She is 21 years old. Karen is married. To make a living, Karen owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for her business comes from selling seafood products, including fish and shrimp, in the local community. Karen has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 10,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Karen joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Karen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Karen is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Karen from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":508887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Since the death of her husband (with whom she had no children) in 2002, she has been living alone in the family of her brother. There, she has set up a little shop selling foodstuffs. She also raises poultry with some thirty hens intended for sale or for her own consumption. The profit from these two activities is divided into four parts: one part goes as her share of costs to her brother's family, two parts go to add to her working capital, and the last part into her savings account with IMCEC. \r\n\r\nWith her profit, she has managed to build her own house that she is intending to rent out after she has made the finishing touches. It is for that reason that she is requesting a loan of 100,000 francs to add to her working capital and thus grow her income.

She was born in Corozal, and she is married and the mother of 5 children, ranging in age from 13 to 19. She lives in Juan Mina, one of the two divisions of the rural area surrounding the Colombian city of Barranquilla, 5 km southwest of the urban center along the Algod\u00f3n highway. It is here that she has operated her business for the past 14 years. Her principal activity is selling locally raised chickens. She also has a restaurant located on the main road. Her work is typical in this area, since there are a number of poulty farms. In her restaurant, her specialty is the delicious and well-known \"sancocho de gallina\" [chicken stew]. She has two freezers to conserve her products, and she has the necessary furniture and equipment for her restaurant. She cooks with wood, which according to her gives better flavor to the food. Her chicken business increases during the Christmas season, and for this reason Isabel needs additional capital to increase her purchases of the product and fulfill the great demand during this season. For this reason, she came to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation to request a Kiva loan, her first financing with this organization. She will invest it in locally bred chickens, buying them in greater quantity than usual, so she can take advantage of the large number of orders her customers have placed with her.

His very poor parents can\u2019t take care of a large family. He was obliged to stop his studies early at primary school level. Thanks to an uncle who took him as an apprentice tailor, he became a skilful worker and quickly gained experience, and obtained his diploma of tailor embroiderer after four (04) years of apprenticeship. His socio-economical situation did not allow him to quickly be on his own. It took him a long time to get married; today he has three (03) children and has five (05) apprentices in his charge. His life is getting better since he received his first credit of $ 300 which he smoothly paid back. His second credit of $ 550 brought him success and his workshop receives prospects everyday. With his dynamism, perseverance, rigor in the management of his workshop and his well done work, Mr M. is more and more needed, but he doesn\u2019t succeed in satisfying his customers in due time because of the lack of sewing machines. These festive period in which there are increasing demands, constitute a nightmare for him.\r\n\r\nThis credit of $ 850 will help him buy a more performing embroidery machine so that he can be quicker in his activities and mainly improve the quality of his services. The realization of this project will considerably improve his income and his economical and financial potential which will make a change in his social and family environment.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur M.

Il doit son salut \u00e0 un oncle qui le recueille comme apprenti tailleur. Tr\u00e8s assidu dans ce m\u00e9tier, il gagna rapidement en exp\u00e9rience et obtint son dipl\u00f4me de tailleur brodeur apr\u00e8s quatre (04) ans d\u2019apprentissage. Sa situation socio \u00e9conomique ne lui permettant pas de se prendre rapidement en charge, il mis du temps pour se marier et a aujourd\u2019hui trois (03 enfants et a \u00e0 sa charge cinq (05) apprentis. Sa situation tend \u00e0 s\u2019am\u00e9liorer depuis que Monsieur M. a re\u00e7u son premier cr\u00e9dit de $300 qu\u2019il avait d\u2019ailleurs bien rembours\u00e9. Son second cr\u00e9dit de $550 l\u2019a totalement relanc\u00e9 et son atelier tr\u00e8s fr\u00e9quent\u00e9. Avec son dynamisme, sa pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance, sa rigueur dans la gestion de son atelier et son travail bien fait, Monsieur M. est de plus en plus sollicit\u00e9, mais il n\u2019arrive pas \u00e0 satisfaire sa client\u00e8le \u00e0 temps \u00e0 cause de l\u2019insuffisance des machines.

Desde ni\u00f1o apoyaba en las labores agr\u00edcolas a sus padres, pero cuando form\u00f3 su propia familia empez\u00f3 a sembrar de manera independiente papas, arvejas y ma\u00edz. Para atender sus cultivos con mucha paciencia se levanta a las 4 de la ma\u00f1ana, que es cuando aprovecha en regar o fumigar, para que a las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana s\u00f3lo se dedique a remover y quitar las yerbas de sus cultivos. Cuando sus cosechas est\u00e1n listas las env\u00eda directamente al mercado m\u00e1s importante y grande de la ciudad de Tarma, donde generalmente logra vender sus productos a un buen precio. Por ello, Manuel se siente muy contento con su actividad, ya que trabaja en armon\u00eda con su esposa y todos sus hijos; por eso, para las cosechas no necesita buscar operarios, prefiere pagarles a sus hijos, de ese modo los motiva a que tambi\u00e9n siembren, pues reconoce que gracias a la agricultura los educ\u00f3 y les brindo una econom\u00eda s\u00f3lida.

El dinero que viene solicitando es para la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos y 24 kilos de  ma\u00edz para su pr\u00f3xima siembra. ","en":"Manuel is 54 years old and lives with his wife in their own home.  They have 6 children and also a 7 year old grandson.  Manuel is known to be a man of good character and an industrious worker.  He has been farming since he was a boy by helping his parents on their property, but when he started a family, he began planting his own crops of potatoes, peas and corn.  Tending to his crops requires much patience.  He wakes up at 4am to begin watering or fumigating.  By 8am, he has moved on to removing weeds.  When his crops have been harvested, he sends them directly to the largest market in the city of Tarma where producers go to get the best price.  Manuel is very pleased with his work and with that of his wife and children.  He does not have to hire workers to harvest crops because he would rather pay his children to do it.  He hopes this will motivate them to start their own farms.  Manuel acknowledges that agriculture has helped educate his children and provided for his family financially.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.   He was able to join because he was invited by a neighbor, so he is very grateful.  He is committed to following the group rules and making his payments on time.  The money he is requesting will be used to buy chemical fertilizers and 24 kilos of corn for the next planting.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":369057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizers and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-15T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":514.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734230}],"funded_date":"2009-08-15T18:28:30Z","paid_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":132889,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma C. is 37 years old CEVI client from Talibon Bohol.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":388503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase bulk crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-15T18:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:39Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023052},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:56Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868293},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757489},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146583},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:28Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984728},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015401}],"funded_date":"2009-09-16T00:36:30Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emina Tudakovic","image":825486}},{"id":141112,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene S. is from the village of Bato.

While both members of the group receive an individual loan, they are both responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if they are delinquent or default. The official name of this borrowing group is V\u1ecdng Nguy\u1ec7t 3 - Nh\u00f3m 03 (3).\r\n<br>T. is married and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, T. owns and operates a tailoring business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing general alteration and tailoring services to local community members. T. has been engaged in this business for over 15 years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,256,000 VND from SEDA. This loan was used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. She is now requesting a new loan of 5,152,000 VND, which will also be used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. The loan will be her third from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About the other borrower in the group<\/b><br>\r\n1.

SPBD's loans are Siupolu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Siupolu C. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD

Saloevich A. has been selling clothes on the market for 17 years. He is married and has 3 children. His wife is not employed and the clothes business is the primary source of income for the Asrarov family. At first he was purchasing clothes in credit from the wholesalers and selling them at the market. However, due to the competition on the market Mr. A. was forced to find an alternative lending source... In the beginning of 2005 he found out about the credit program \"Microintrest\". Mr. A. received a loan and with that money was able to purchase goods from wholesalers without credit, which resulted in lower prices. After receiving more loans he was able to import the goods himself, bypassing the wholesaler altogether. Currently Misharif A. regularly travels to Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) himself to import the clothes he will sell at the market. He also sells clothes in credit to the small merchants from kishlaks (mountain villages) which is profitable for both parties. A part of the income he uses to support his family, but majority he has dedicated to expanding his business.\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva

They named their group the Mathew Group. They are local entrepreneurs in the town of Makeni. This is the sixth time they\u2019ve received a Kiva loan through SMT. Previously, each one in the group received a loan of 1,000,000 LE. That loan created meaningful impact in the lives of these people. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees. They\u2019re also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans. Today, they are requesting a loan of 3,000,000 LE to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n<P>\r\nIsatu S. (left) is the leader of the group. She is thirty-five years of age. She was born in Makeni, north of Sierra Leone. She is married with three children. Two of her children are in secondary school and one is in primary school. Her husband is a businessman who sells second-hand clothes. Isatu sells both soft and hard drinks in Makeni City.\r\n<P>\r\nWith this new loan, Isatu will expand on her business. She will be able to buy at least twelve crates of soft drinks, seven crates of beer, three crates of Battery energy drink and three crates of power shakes.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Don Mart\u00edn se dedica a la agricultura y toda su familia le ayuda un poco a la hora de la siembra y la recolecta de los cultivos. \nLa comunidad en la cual vive Mart\u00edn se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de unos dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la agricultura y a las lecher\u00edas. El Sauce tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano, sin embargo varias veces al a\u00f1o, el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que caen en la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. Cuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en el Atl\u00e1ntico de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona.\nCon Mart\u00edn tiene un peque\u00f1o terreno de 1.2 hect\u00e1reas en el cual siembra diferentes cultivos como ma\u00edz, frijoles, pl\u00e1tano y caf\u00e9. \u00c9l tiene 27 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a la agricultura.

Con esto espera lograr una buena cosecha que pueda vender y ayudar a salir adelante a su familia. La cosecha la espera vender en la misma finca. \nDon Mart\u00edn es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la microfinanciera EDESA. Gracias a su vinculaci\u00f3n con esta organizaci\u00f3n ha obtenido ya 6 microcr\u00e9ditos y todos los ha cancelado satisfactoriamente.

Actualmente don Mart\u00edn necesita un pr\u00e9stamo por quinientos mil colones para comprar las semillas y el fertilizante.\n","en":"Mart\u00edn V. A. is 42.  He lives with his wife and 3 children:  Gustavo, Jason, and Estiven.  Don Mart\u00edn makes a living through agriculture, and his whole family helps him a little during planting and harvesting seasons.  The area where Mart\u00edn lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba.  It's a small rural community with 2,000 people.  They are dedicated to agriculture and dairy operations.  El Sauce has an irregular landscape, and much of the land is mantained as tropical forests.  The community has very picturesque landscapes which combine the tropical forest with lovely lakes, coffee plantations, and dairy farms.  El Sauce is approximately an hour and a half from Turrialba by bus, the closest city.  Several times a year, the road becomes impassable because of the rains that fall in the area.  This is without a doubt one of the biggest challenges for the community.  When there isn't any work, the people choose to look for jobs in Turrialba or on banana farms located in the Atlantic region of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nCurrently the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so the neighbors are looking to invest in projects in their area.  Mart\u00edn has 1.2 hectares, on which he plants different crops like corn, beans, plantains, and coffee.  He has been dedicated to agriculture for 27 years.  During this time, he has had seasons that have gone very well and others when he has had to battle problems such as bad prices or natual phenomenons that damage his crops.  He obtained his land through a small loan.  Previously he had to rent land to sow his crops.\r\n\r\nDon Mart\u00edn is a client of the Association of Producers in El Sauce, a local organization that is a member of the microfinance institution EDESA.  Thanks to his connections with this organization, he has already obtained six microcredits, and all of them have been paid back satisfactorily.  The amounts of the loans have increased from 100,000 colones (180 USD) to 250,000 (450 USD) colones.  Currently don Mart\u00edn needs a loan of 500,000 (900 USD) colones to purchase seeds and fertilizer.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva

Miray, Baliangao. She is 29 years old, married, with 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Anecita owns and operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Anecita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Anecita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anecita has successfully repaid a previous loan  from PMPC. Anecita is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase a fishing boat. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Anecita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He lives together with his two sons, with whom he has assumed the role of father and mother owing to his separation from his wife.  His dream to educate his children led him to put together his own locksmith's shop, in which he has worked for more than 10 years.  He began the shop with the support of some friends, who helped him to get his first customers.  He now has two shops and a good number of customers who frequently solicit his services.  This profession enables him to continue improving his economic income, and it is for this reason that one of his goals is to install his locksmith's shops in commercial zones, where the shops' locations would generate increased earnings.  However, in order to achieve this goal, he must keep a watchful eye on his two locations; to help him try to do this, he relies on the assistance of his sons and father to keep the shops running smoothly.  To be able to expand, he must improve the quality of the labor at his shops. To do this, he requires various tools that he has been waiting to modernize, since the ones he has are all worn out and need replacing.  This is his first loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA, for which he promises to be responsible with his payments and toward the institution.  The 2500 soles that he is requesting will permit him to buy the tools and materials required for him to complete the remaining jobs he has yet to complete for his customers.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":378462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Compra de materiales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-27T18:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":171.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":177.68},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":181.36},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":190.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":194.79},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":201.85},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":214.06},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":216.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":226.99},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":232.1},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":241.94},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.23},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.62},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.26},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":850,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2516,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081256}],"funded_date":"2009-08-28T21:16:20Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":137017,"name":"Marcelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"42-year-old Marcelina J. is a married woman who mothers eight children.

Maylen has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. She is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP, which will be used to make improvements to her house. This loan will be her ninth from PMPC.

She lives in a rented home with her two children.  Fiorella is 20, and Gerson is 13.  What she wants most of all is to give them a good life.\r\n\r\nShe makes her living as a street vendor selling clothes.  Every day she goes to public and private institutions looking for customers who want to buy something that she is selling.  She brings the clothes from the city of Lima.  That is why the clothes she sells are very new and striking.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is advising her customers about what clothes are in style.  She has been doing this for 20 years.  The most difficult part is having to walk all day looking for customers.  Later she hopes to have enough money to have a store where she can sell more calmly.\r\n\r\nThis is Deizi\u2019s third loan with MFP.  She is prepared to work very hard to make her payments on time.  She is much loved in her communal bank.  She always adds a lot of joy to the meetings.  She will use the 1,000 PEN that she is asking for to buy more clothes in the city of Lima so that her customers can choose from a greater variety. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":419113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-03T01:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deizi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":203.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843135},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":407.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734713},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":203.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959778},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":203.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992627}],"funded_date":"2009-11-03T02:42:08Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":153523,"name":"Raineria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raineria P. is from the village of Mahinog, Camiguin.

She owns a business venture, selling traditional handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Sina has many years of experience in this business.  Sina needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sina joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sina P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.65 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Married to Folro B., a tricycle driver, she is blessed with three children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life. She has been managing her own egg stall and doing direct selling of cosmetics for eight years now.\r\n\r\nNoime has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings* and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her egg-selling and cosmetics direct-selling businesses.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, Noime would like to apply for a PHP 16,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying more quantities of products to be incorporated into her inventory.\r\n\r\nNoime dreams that her businesses will continue to be successful. She also prays that her family will continue to be closer to each other and with the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":511082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

In the future, she plans to promote and expand her business, and she thanks you for your support. <p>\r\n\r\nWhether on the streets of Kathmandu or in the villages outside of the capital, tea shops are places of business and meeting in Nepal.  Called a chiya pasal, these tea shops make a sweet, milky tea that can be purchased for a few cents a cup.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to keep their store shelves stocked while increasing their profit margins by buying in greater volume. <p>\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner, MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Operating throughout the Kathmandu Valley, it offers microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to its clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  <p>\r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner page and keep an eye out for new loans and borrower updates.

Mongolia. His oldest four children, ages 10 to 17, attend a local secondary school while the youngest, age 2 years old, stays at home with Jamsranjav's wife. Jamsranjav operates a horse-cart business in his town. He carries supply loads and people from the local market to various destinations. For each trip, he earns between 3,000-5,000 tugriks (MNT). His business earnings are currently not sufficient to take care of his family; therefore, his wife is planning to operate a boot-making business.

Her previous loan of PHP 7,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Nomeriana aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Nancy works as a peasant farmer for a living. Her community of Kagwe village does not have access to clean water. The water that is used for drinking and cooking is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases. Nancy is a friendly member of the community, and has been elected Promoter by her village to help its members obtain safe drinking water.\n\nAs a volunteer Promoter, Nancy represents the community on Kiva\u2019s website and educates the community on how to protect their families from unsafe drinking water by using a chlorine dispenser system. Nancy and four other promoters in her community, namely Joshua, Siprina, Eunice and Lodphine, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Nancy wants to be a promoter because she  believes that the chlorine will destroy germs in water, therefore making it safe to use. She hopes that this will make the community healthier, thus allowing community members to attend work and school.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Nancy\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1804281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To ensure that the community has access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lodphine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joshua ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siprina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":847341,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello, lenders, meet Elizabeth.

They also say they are always happy because Pro-Mujer offers them a huge help with the services they grant to their members. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the help of the service consultant, Sonia Aguayo Zeballos, they have been able to make a very well organized group. The group includes several small businesses, such as stores. Others are street vendors that sell artisan chocolates and crafts. The majority of them sell clothing they bring from the Desaguedero where prices are better. Therefore, they need to invest more capital to make trips to Desaguedero or other places where wholesale goods are sold. In this manner, the merchandise acquired will result in greater profits to be reinvested in expanding their businesses. <p>\r\n\r\nMoreover, they need to increase their incomes to support their families.
