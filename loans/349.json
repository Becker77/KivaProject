They live in their own home located in the community of Jose Olaya, Pangoa. Custodio is a humble man with a desire to excel. He says that when he arrived to this place in search of better living conditions, he realized that things were not so easy. However, as he is a man of action, he quickly adapted to the ways of work. Thanks to his effort and perseverance, he demonstrated skill and since then has never lacked work. He also won't always work as a laborer.

A motorcycle will enable him to do volunteer community health work, along with income-generating activities, more efficiently. \n\nAdditionally, he will enroll in the local clinic to be on call for any emergencies at night.

weaves huipiles (the typical dress of Guatemala women) by hand and raises chickens, ducks, and turkeys.  She has woven since she was a little girl, but with more simple patterns.  Five years ago she began to weave really detailed and fancy huipiles, such as for weddings.  These cost a lot to weave, not only in terms of thread, but also, more than anything, in terms of time.  She works for up to two or three months on one huipil, but she can sell them in the city of Antigua Guatemala for 3,000 to 3,700 Guatemala Quetzals (US$400-500), depending on the quality and level of detail.  Alejandra is very talented and weaves very beautiful huipiles.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting this loan to purchase more thread for weaving her huipiles and to buy more chickens and turkeys, food for them, and medicine to prevent illnesses.  She also would like to make improvements to the shelter where she keeps them, such as constructing better walls and buying more corrugated tin to better protect them from the rain.  Right now she has one cow in addition to a bunch of chickens, ducks, and turkeys.  When they are big she takes them to the market in the nearby city of San Martin Jilotepeque for sale.\r\n<p>\r\nAlejandra is married and her husband works in construction in Guatemala City.  They have six children ranging in age from six to twenty-one years old.  All of her children have studied or are currently studying, but only up to the sixth grade because of a lack of economic resources.  Her oldest son just got married in February and, while this was a very happy occasion, it cost a lot, so this loan would help Alejandra a lot right now, as resources are currently a little tight.  This is her first loan with FAPE and she is really excited to have the opportunity to invest in her businesses.  She notes that if she doesn\u2019t have thread, she can\u2019t work, so she needs this loan right away to help her continue working.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlejandra has many dreams for her businesses and her family.  She wants to expand her businesses enough to increase her income to be able to pay for more school for her children and to be able to buy more necessities for them, such as shoes and better clothing.  More than anything she dreams that her children study, find jobs, prosper, and get ahead in life.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Spanish by Megan Montgomery, Kiva Fellow.<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nAlejandra teje g\u00fcipiles (el vestido t\u00edpico de mujeres en Guatemala) a mano y cr\u00eda pollos, patos, y chompipes.  Ha tejido desde chiquita, pero con dise\u00f1os m\u00e1s sencillos.  Hace cinco a\u00f1os, empez\u00f3 a tejer g\u00fcipiles muy detallados y elaborados, como para bodas.  Estos cuestan mucho para tejer, no solo en t\u00e9rminos de hilo sino, m\u00e1s que nada, en tiempo.  Ella trabaja por hasta dos o tres meses en un g\u00fcipil, pero los puede vender en la ciudad de Antigua Guatemala por 3.000 a 3.700 Quetzales Guatemaltecos (aproximadamente $400-500), dependiendo de la calidad y nivel de detalle.  Alejandra tiene mucho talento y sus g\u00fcipiles son bell\u00edsimas.  \r\n<p>\r\nEst\u00e1 pidiendo este pr\u00e9stamo para comprar m\u00e1s hilo para tejer g\u00fcipiles y para comprar m\u00e1s pollos y chompipes, comida para ellos, y medicinas para ellos para prevenir enfermedades.  Tambi\u00e9n tiene ganas de mejorar el refugio donde guarda los pollos, como con unas vallas mejores y m\u00e1s l\u00e1mina para protegerlos de la lluvia.  Ahora tiene un ganado adem\u00e1s que varios pollos, patos, y chompipes.  Cuando est\u00e1n grandes, los lleva al mercado en la ciudad cercana San Martin Jilotepeque.  \r\n<p>\r\nElla es casada y su esposo trabaja como alba\u00f1il en la ciudad capital de Guatemala.  Tienen seis hijos de edades desde seis a veintiuno a\u00f1os.  Todos sus hijos han estudiado o est\u00e1n estudiando, pero solamente hasta el sexto b\u00e1sico por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos.  Su hijo m\u00e1s grande acaba de casarse en Febrero, y aunque este era una ocasi\u00f3n muy feliz, cost\u00f3 mucho, entonces ahora este pr\u00e9stamo la ayudar\u00eda much\u00edsimo en este momento, porque tiene pocos recursos ahora.  Este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo de FAPE, y est\u00e1 muy emocionada de tener la oportunidad de invertir en sus negocios.  Dice que si no tiene hilo, no puede trabajar, entonces necesita el pr\u00e9stamo ahorita para ayudarle en seguir trabajando.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlejandra tiene muchos sue\u00f1os para sus negocios y para su familia.

","en":"Genoveva is 57 years old.  She is a very happy woman who remains active in her work.  She lives with the father of her 7 children, 6 of whom still live at home.  She raises cows and plants crops, but of those two activities, she enjoys caring for her animals the most.\r\n<p>\r\nShe wakes up each morning to gather the necessary amount of fodder to feed her cows.  Once the cows are together in a single place, she locks up the calves in a corral until she finishes milking and feeding the adults.  The milk is delivered to a buyer who pays 1.60 soles per liter.  After that, she packs a lunchbox on to her back and walks 3 to 4 kilometers to where her husband is working in the fields.\r\n<p>\r\nGenoveva is very happy to do this work every day because it generates a good income and allows her to accumulate money to maintain her home. In the future, she plans to purchase more calves that become full grown dairy cows that can help increase her daily earnings. \r\n<p>\r\nGenoveva is on her ninth loan with MFP and is committed to completing her payments as she has done previously. She enjoys very much the companionship and support of her communal bank group. Part of the money she is requesting will be used to purchase another plot of land to plant oats that will feed her cows.  The remaining funds will be set aside to buy fertilizer for her potato fields.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":349891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer and animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-11T08:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Genoveva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734008}],"funded_date":"2009-07-11T15:42:49Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":125099,"name":"Faustina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faustina O. is married and has two children.

She has done this for 26 years and has managed to build up a clientele.  She began with loans and her objective has been to improve her house in order to have a decent place to live.  She lives in a neighborhood in the outlying area of the city, where there is contaminated water, which is troubling since each family has to pay expenses to make their own drain and be able to be in hygenic conditions.  Her plans are to expand her business and sell more.  With this credit she will purchase zinc in order to change out a bad sheet on her roof.  She does not want to suffer through another winter this way, since she has to move her things so they don't get ruined.

Sonia is very knowledgeable about agriculture and she hopes to use this loan to exploit the benefits of her home-made organic fertilizer. Occasionally, Sonia offers workshops to people interested in agriculture and farming.\r\n\r\nSonia has cited communication problems as one of her main obstacles. At the moment, she is waiting to hear back from the government body in charge of phone installations to find out how she might go about getting a phone in her home. Another obstacle for her has been a lack of access to financial services. In the past, Sonia has not been able to obtain the economic resources necessary for the expansion of her poultry-selling business.

who live in La Rita, Lim\u00f3n, located near the Carribbean coast of Costa Rica. The loan consultant who has been working with these women describes them as a motivated collection of individuals with the desire and ability to work hard towards the success of the group as well as the overall improvement of living conditions for the members and their families. In general, the main obstacle to the success of these women has been a lack of access to working capital. This loan will enable the group members to invest in their businesses and expand operations. \r\n\r\nThe women of this group are involved in various productive activities including the rearing and selling of animals (pigs and chickens) as well as commercial and industrial activities. Nuvia, Tania, Yesenia and Lilliana R. have businesses selling clothing in their community. For these women, this loan will be used to finance the purchase of inventory items such as clothing for men, women and children as well as shoes and jewelry. \r\n\r\nLilliana Morin and Doris are in the business of animal rearing. While Lilliana raises chickens and pigs, Doris only handles chickens. For these two loan recipients, this loan will be used to finance investments in livestock, animal feed and construction materials (for the construction of animal pens).\r\nRita is the elected president of this group.  During the week, she takes care of her children and carries out domestic tasks at home. During this time, clients come to peruse various items she has for sale such as clothing, jewelry and shoes. On the weekends, she travels from door to door in her community selling items to clients. Sometimes, her husband goes with her and they travel to neighbouring communities in order to find new clients.\r\n \r\nRita says her main goal is to increase the income generated from her sales business. She says that with more revenue, she will be able to provide a higher standard of living for her family. She would also like to increase the amount of revenue she receives from sales to stores as opposed to individual clients. Rita explained that, like other group members, her main hindrance has been a lack of access to working capital. She says that this loan represents an opportunity to overcome this obstacle. \r\n\r\nThe members of The Women\u00b4s Bank of Faith have been neighbours and friends for a number of years. The group acknowledges the advantages of the group lending model: the ability for each group member to act as a loan guarantor as well as recipient. They also acknowledge the potential disadvantage which could manifest itself if any members have trouble making repayments, as each individual is responsible for all repayments.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":612583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"For the purchase of clothing, jewelry, livestock and animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"La Rita, Lim\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-05T17:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yensy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yessenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nuvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":215808.46},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":219405.27},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":223062.02},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":226779.72},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":230559.39},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":234385.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":427.62},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":434.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":441.99},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":449.36},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.85},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":464.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":427.62,"local_amount":215808.46,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":216940.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411576},{"amount":434.75,"local_amount":219405.27,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":220556.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182551365},{"amount":441.99,"local_amount":223062.02,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":224232.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148786},{"amount":906.21,"local_amount":457350.84,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":459749.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970535},{"amount":464.43,"local_amount":234373.41,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":235602.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289980}],"funded_date":"2010-10-08T00:19:35Z","paid_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":240680,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria C. worked as a hair stylist for many years at Ofir\u2019s Beauty Salon in Brownsville.

He says that even though the loan was small, \"it took me over a hump and enabled me to launch my business with a more complete website, an employee and a strong infrastructure.\"  Without this loan, Frank says getting Business Startups on its feet would have been more difficult.\r\n\r\nACCION Texas-Louisiana was Frank\u2019s first choice for taking out a loan, and is the first loan he has taken out for his business.  \"I have known about ACCION for many years.  I believe in its philosophy and the concept of micro loans.  I also know many people at ACCION.  It is a great organization with great people.\"\r\n\r\nMr. L.\u2019s advice to other small business owners is, \"\u2026 dream big, plan carefully, be persistent, work hard and have faith.\"  On his website, he gives free advice and examples of essential things to consider when starting a business.  This helps entrepreneurs understand the preparation needed for starting a business, and how Business Startups can help meet those needs with expert advice and planning.\r\n\r\nCheck out the Business

She herself was not able to complete her education, and her dream is to enable her children complete their education. She has customers from her community and from among her neighbors as she stands out in her field due to her good prices and the quality of the items in her store.

camino, la actividad economica de la comunidad es la agricultura \u00f3 comercio ya que crian animales como borregos, puercos, pollos y guajolotes para poderlos vender, es manera de poder tener ingresos extras mas que nada de las se\u00f1oras ya que los hombres salen a trabajar y muchos de ellos se van a la ciudad de M\u00e9xico en busca de un trabajo, En el grupo de la carrera se encuentra

cebolla etc; la se\u00f1ora tiene poco mas de 4 a\u00f1os que se animo a vender verdura en su comunidad, no tiene un lugar estable en el que pueda estar vendiendo, lo que hace es andar caminando casa por casa para ofrecer su mercancia, y se le dificulta mucho la caminada y andar cargando la verdura, tambien que le calcula en el peso para poder dar los kilos, pero muchas veces la gente siempre le pide mas porque dice que le falta para completar el kilo, son estas las cosas que en ocasiones desaniman a la se\u00f1ora de seguir con el negocio, la se\u00f1ora Victoria piensa invertir el crdito en comprar mas verdura para salir a vender y tener un poco mas de ganancias y tambien utilizar las cosas que no se vendan para que ella pueda hacer su comida en casa, le gustaria mucho a la se\u00f1ora

The community is large and located on the skirts of a mountain.  To get to it one must travel quite a bit.  Although there is a highway in good condition there is no taxi or bus service.  People relate that it\u2019s quite normal for them to walk quite a bit to get into or to leave their community.  However, they are now used to this and the road doesn\u2019t even seem very long to them anymore.\n\nThe community\u2019s economic activity is farming or commerce since they raise such animals as lambs, pigs, chickens and turkeys to sell.  This is a way of earning extra income more for the women than the men because the men to out to work and many of them go to M\u00e9xico City to look for work.\n\nThe La Carrera group has a representative, Victoria, who tells us about her business.  Her business is selling vegetables.  She sells squash, carrots, squash blossoms, cactus paddles, chayote, cilantro, onions, etc.  It\u2019s been a little more than four years now that she ventured to sell vegetables in her community.  She does not have a fixed location to sell so she does it going house to house to offer her merchandise.  It\u2019s quite difficult for her to walk so much carrying her vegetables.  She also has to calculate the weight to sell by the kilo and often people insist on more because they claim the kilo is short.  These are the things that sometimes discourage her to continue with the business.\n\nVictoria plans to use the loan to buy more vegetables to go out to sell and have a bit more profits and she uses the items she doesn\u2019t sell to prepare her meals at home.  She\u2019d very much like to have a locale of her own to sell several things and to have a large store in order to not have to be wandering about anymore and be able to stay at home with her business.\n\nVictoria has three children going to school.  She\u2019s 37 years old and has been married 14 years.  She lives wither family in her own house and her husband works in M\u00e9xico City.\n\nThe rest of the group members are: \n\n1.-Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngela, she raises sheep and chickens to sell\n2.-Mar\u00eda Bonifacia, she makes napkins and embroiders\n3.-Fidelina, she has a grocery store\n4.-Alejandra, makes napkins, sews and also knows how to embroider\n5.-Julia, raises and sells sheep\n6.-Ernestina, raises chickens and turkeys\n7.-Noe, raises sheep to sell\n8.-Mar\u00eda, knows how to embroider and sells tablecloths\n9.-Abel, has a grocery store in his community\n\nThere are 10 members in the La Carrera group and they named it that way after a community that\u2019s very near them and they like the name very much; that\u2019s why they decided to name their group that.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":816696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to sell fruit and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3925,"lender_count":135,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Bonifacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fidelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ernestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noe ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":46000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":3925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.62},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":490.62},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":490.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1471.88,"local_amount":17250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":17321.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227202012},{"amount":981.25,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":11547.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807421},{"amount":981.25,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":11547.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238619010},{"amount":490.62,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5773.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572768}],"funded_date":"2011-08-19T18:02:27Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":322636,"name":"Lluvia Dorada De Ixtlahuaca Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo se llama \"Lluvia Dorada\" y se ubica en el estado de M\u00e9xico.

She is also happy and friendly. She lives with Santos who is in active service for the military. They have two children, ages 14 and 9, and live in a lovely house that they bought through a lot of hard work. \r\n\r\nLaura rents vehicles known as mototaxis. She started with savings from her husband, buying one mototaxi and looking for a responsible driver. She found one of her neighbors who pays her 30 nuevos soles per day to rent the vehicle. This way she was able to save and buy second mototaxi that she rents to another neighbor who she considers to be responsible. What she likes about her business is the additional income that it generates, as well as watching her capital increase. She doesn't like when it rains because her vehicles break down. She has plans to keep growing and now wants to make her house bigger and build rooms to rent to singles. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 4th loan with MFP.

Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level), the cold, the difficulty of growing crops and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cDios es Amor\u201d is located at approximately 4,000 meters above sea-level, in the community of Pilpichaca, in the district with the same name, province of Huaytar\u00e1. The main activities of the population are growing potatoes and wheat at lower altitudes, and raising sheep and alpaca in the higher areas. The area is known for alpacas and their wool production. Because of the high altituD., the area is not very suitable for agriculture, but the natural grass (pasture) makes it very favorable for raising alpacas and sheep. In the small town of Pilpichaca, on the main road from Huancavelica to the \u201cV\u00eda Libertadores\u201d highway that connects Ayacucho with the coast and Peru\u00b4s capital, L., there are some shops and some produce cheese, but alpaca wool and meat production is the main activity.\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank is starting its first loan cycle with 19 female borrowers and a total loan of 4,400 soles (about 1,575 US$). Most of the loans are of 200 soles, with three exceptions of loans of 400 soles. As the group is just starting its first cycle, the group was not able to save, except for the initial loan to start. But all agree to save in the future.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Lourdes C. C.. Lourdes has a small grocery store where she also sells sweets. Her 200 soles loan she will use to fill up her small store again. During the breaks at the local school, she also sells sweets at the entrance of the school. In the future she hopes to be able to buy a house in a bigger city and run a business there. And like most women, she wants her children to be professionals when they leave college. In the shorter run she will be saving for her children\u2019s education and to increase her business. Now that she has entered in FINCA Peru, she wants to learn how to work more enthusiastically and responsibly and how to save.\r\n<p>\r\nVictoria S. D. S. has her business of selling clothes at local weekly or biweekly markets. Other business she runs are buying and selling of cheese, trout and sheep. With her 200 soles loan she will buy new merchandise to go to the markets. Her dream for the future is to have a small restaurant and to grow little by little.

R. is 49 years old, married, and has 7 children, 3 of whom depend on her. Her oldest daughter is 19 years old and she is in her 5th year of secondary school. Her son of 13 years is in 6th grade of primary school. Her 3 year old daughter is in 2nd grade of primary school. Her husband works as a farmer. Yolanda wishes to make her business more active, because the difficult situation in her country is hard to endure. Furthermore, she wants to continue to contribute help to her children, because they need to have a future that is full of studies, so that in the future they may survive on their own.\r\n\r\nYolanda\u2019s economic activity is a local store in which she sells products like candy, basic grains, ice, soft drinks, chicken, and liquor. Her business is located in her house that is located on Colegio Pureza de Maria 100 Varas Arriba. Yolanda started her business because she didn\u2019t have a stable job as a source of income for her and her family, so she decided to begin the sale of shopping bags and basic grains. In the beginning, she didn\u2019t sell a lot of these products, and so she decided to increase the size of her business and decided to invest in another business of video games and to stock up her store with more products. It is this way that she secured her own workplace that functions as her source of income for her family. This loan is to be used to buy controls for the videogames that she sells, and for her store, because she has to offer a large variety of products to her clients\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matt Capetola, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":240758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy video game controllers and to stock her store.

He has a business selling secondhand furniture in a rented premises.  His memories of childhood are in the fields, and until now he has done that wonderful activity but only two days a week when it is fruit harvest time.  The purchase and resale of used furniture is a very profitable business.  After each sale he can earn up to 700 soles ($225 USD), put he tells us that at this time his sales are down.  Because of this he is harvesting bananas every weekend, until the demand for furniture improves.  Although he really likes being in his furniture store, Luis does not fail to care for his crops because, for him, they are part of life.  Luis has recently begun to learn about municipal banks, and is very thankful to be a part of one.  This is his first loan, and he is committed to paying the installments on the arranged dates.

SDA Primary school, Makeni was founded in 1978 by SDA Makeni to use education as a vehicle for spreading the Adventist message. They train young boys in the morals and ethics of the Adventist Mission. Presently, the school has a population of fifty-six pupils and a staff of twelve teachers.<p>\r\n\r\nPresently, SDA Makeni suffers a number of constrains. First, they lack a water-well. The tap-head of the well they used to have has been stolen, forcing the children to fetch drinking water from the neighborhood. Second, SDA suffers from lack of sufficient benches and classrooms. They used to have sufficient benches, but rebels used all of those benches as firewood. Then Plan Sierra Leone (an NGO) provided them with new ones, only for people around the neighborhood to steal all of them again. Thus the children have to carry their own benches from home every day to school.<p>\r\n\r\nHowever, with the change of administration three months ago, SDA Primary school is revitalizing, thanks to the new headmaster, Mr. Benjamin Kamara (not part of this loan). The new administration is able to buy benches for classes five and six through school fees subsidies and development funds. The school has also been able to hire two security guards to keep thieves at bay. And for the first time in the history of the school, they will be organizing athletics for the pupils. This will give popularity and fame to the school.<p>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, some of these teachers will start a small business and those who are already running small businesses will invest the loan into their business. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children in their education or pay for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in home building projects.  <p>\r\n\r\nAbdul K. K. (back row, second from right) is the leader of this group of teachers. Abdul was born in Mamamah, about 110 miles from Makeni. He is age forty-eight, married to a teacher and the two of them have two children. One of their children is in class four and the other is in class two. Abdul will invest his loan in business and he has been in business for over four years now.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":290802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Invest in Business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T06:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdul K.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mabel M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edna F.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mara M.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She gets up very early in the morning to go to the wholesale market in order to be able to stock her business with fresh fruit and vegetables as they are perishable foods for which she has a lot of demand.  By mid morning she has no merchandise left and this makes her feel very satisfied and means that her work is very profitable.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this work, she also sells cakes and jellies (jell-o) which she makes herself.  What she likes most about her business is chatting to her customers and also the fact that the provisions which she doesn't manage to sell she uses for her family's meals.  She has been in this business for 6 years and the most difficult thing about her work is packing shopping bags since she suffers from lower back pain.  In the future she is planning to add a second level to her house.  This is her ninth loan from MFP and she pledges to be punctual in her repayments in order to avoid making things difficult for her community bank.

Albeiro works everyday from 5:30 am until 8:00 pm, and although his workday is long, Albeiro believes that only with responsibility, an enterprising spirit and dedication can he make his dream come true, the dream of turning his fruit and vegetable store into a supermarket that offers his customers a large variety of products so he will be able to build his own house.\r\n \r\nRight now Albeiro wants his fruit and vegetable store to have more and more customers, and as a strategy he intends to stock a large variety of products and make some changes to the premises. To do this, he needs a loan because his income is not high enough to cover such an investment.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":768586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock his fruit and vegetable store and make changes to the premises","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2011-05-14T21:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albeiro Arleyson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":87790},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":90156},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":92586},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":95082},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":97645},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":100277},{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":102980},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":105756},{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":108606},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":111534},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":114540},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":117628},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":120798},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":124054},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":127398},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":130832},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":134359},{"due_date":"2012-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":137979}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.38},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.71},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.49},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.41},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.48},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.09},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.74},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.58},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":49.38,"local_amount":87790,"processed_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":88986.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216535238},{"amount":50.71,"local_amount":90156,"processed_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-20T07:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":91384.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222355498},{"amount":51.65,"local_amount":91820,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":93071.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227220242},{"amount":108.84,"local_amount":193493,"processed_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":196129.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238645967},{"amount":54.13,"local_amount":96223,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":97534.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250814707},{"amount":115.74,"local_amount":205764,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":208567.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257223495},{"amount":65.04,"local_amount":115632,"processed_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":117207.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263361517},{"amount":629.51,"local_amount":1119122,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1134370.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270074907}],"funded_date":"2011-05-29T14:24:30Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":302164,"name":"Martine","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e en 1973, Martine est mari\u00e9e \u00e0 Michel un m\u00e9canicien Auto.

To him the most important things are his friends and drinking.   \n\nShe lived with \u00c1lvaro, father of the children, for two years, but he only caused problems. He would not come home for up to three days in a row, he wouldn't bring any food home, he didn't help pay the rent. This irresponsible behavior was because he had another wife. However, Diana found out about everything and decided the best thing was to separate. \n\nBut she does not care, since she knows she can get ahead by herself without his help. She prefers living alone than putting up with a husband who is full of problems.  \n\nSix months ago shes had to quit because she had a nervous breakdown which was so strong that she lost control and fell into a depression. \nThe children were very surprised and sad over what was happening because they always had the image of their mom being a fighter and a tireless woman. \nThe problem got worse since she had none to take care of the children but she didn't want anything bad to happen to them.  \n\nShe had a lot of problems at home and with herself and at moments she thought there was no way out. But one day her oldest son gave her a big hug and told her that he loved her because she was the best mom in the world. \n\nShe stayed looking at him firmly in the eyes and smiled at him and promised that she would fight like always and that he would have everything he needed. \n\nThe following day she met up with a friend and told her what a difficult time she was having. Her friend told her that \"with God's help she would lack nothing\" and she helped her find a job through another friend. \n\nShe was able to do the new job they found her at home and in this way she could take care of the children. \n\nCurrently, Diana is not in the best financial situation since it took her a while to find a job and alone taking care of the expenses for her and the children is difficult. \n\nHowever she does not want to give up on the idea of becoming a medical administrative technician. She feels this is a great opportunity for her to finish her studies and in this way give her children a better quality of life. \n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1575312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of tuition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sofie Bjorksten","image":null}},{"id":2227,"name":"Maria Herlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Herlinda is a very hard-working woman and together with her partner has five children.

Thi Yen's family relied mainly on farming and raising a small number of livestock to earn a living, because she did not have enough capital and her children were still small. In 1994, the TYM Fund expanded to Phu Minh village and she became one of the members. Her first loan was 300.000VND (about 20USD) to purchase 3 pigs to breed, which yielded a small profit. Over the years, she continued to borrow to expand the pig sty and purchase more chickens, pigs and geese to breed and sell to other villagers. She also reared pigs to sell to butchers. Every year, her annual income from raising livestock and poultry was about 40,000,000VND (about 2667USD). Currently, she has 200 pigs and hundreds of chickens, geese and ducks. Her family's economy has improved tremendously thanks to the loans through the TYM Fund. Her family has become the model of raising livestock in Phu Minh village. Mrs Yen hopes that the TYM Fund will continue to reach out and provide help for the poor who do not have enough capital to improve their quality of life. This time, she would like to borrow 19,000,000VND (1,150USD) to invest in raising livestock and poultry. Her family's average monthly income is 7,000,000VND (about 466USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nC\u0169ng nh\u01b0 bao gia \u0111\u00ecnh n\u00f4ng d\u00e2n kh\u00e1c trong x\u00e3 Ph\u00fa Minh, gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb Kh\u1ed5ng Th\u1ecb Y\u1ebfn ch\u1ee7 y\u1ebfu l\u00e0m ru\u1ed9ng v\u00e0 ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i nh\u1ecf l\u1ebb, b\u1edfi ch\u1ecb kh\u00f4ng c\u00f3 v\u1ed1n \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i v\u00e0 khi \u0111\u00f3 c\u00e1c con v\u1eabn nh\u1ecf.

Since then, she has become one of the popular food vendors in her neighborhood. She is now 56 years old and married, with three children who are currently in school. She serves many kinds of local dishes like fufu, rice balls, banku, and ampesi among others. Fufu is prepared from pounded cassava and plantain, and eaten with soup. Banku is prepared from milled maize grains and it is eaten with hot pepper or soup. Ampesi is a boiled plantain or yam and it is eaten with any stew. She wants to use the loan to buy more raw materials like bags of maize, baskets of cassava, plantain, meat, fish, vegetables and firewood.

Since she was a little girl Norma has worked in agriculture. She knows farmwork very well, and when she and her husband went to work in the fields she noticed that at lunchtime her co-workers only had a soft drink and a piece of cake. It was then that she came up with the idea of making meals and taking them to the fields and her co-workers happily agreed. Since then, her husband works in the fields and Norma prepares meals starting at 5:00 am so that breakfast is ready at 8:00 am, lunch at 12:00 pm and she ends by bringing dinner at 6:00 pm. Norma is very happy, she never imagined that she would turn into an expert cook and that this would turn out to be so profitable that with this income her childrens\u00b4 standard of living would improve.

Little by little they gradually watched it grow until they came to Chibolo Magdalena to begin a new life in the community of Soledad.  At first they started with a small tavern in the city of Camelot and later they used their savings to buy a lot upon which they built.  They were able to unite the couple\u2019s two careers: his, selling provisions and drink and hers, selling merchandise via catalogue.  The catalogue business gradually grew and now occupies an area of her husband\u2019s big store.  He is soliciting a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n in order to replenish the store\u2019s stock of clothing, footwear, and sweaters which he sells to Magdalena\u2019s population.\r\n\r\nPedro G. learned about business from his mom, an exemplary woman and very business oriented.  Today with his wife Ruth Mar\u00eda, also a businesswoman, he has advanced and has in addition to the general store, a business providing services such as internet and photocopying.  \r\n\r\nPedro has noticed that his business has grown with the 3 loans provided by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  He has been able to improve the infrastructure of equipment and furnishings.  He now has the capacity to offer new services and pay an assistant.  Perhaps most importantly, he is able to acquire merchandise \u201cwithout agonizing over expensive credit\u201d.  This family knows where it is going and has a great enthusiasm for their business because, as Pedro says, it has given his family everything.  His young sons want to participate and he occasionally allows them to help, as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with their homework.

Lorelyn would like a loan to finance the repairs needed for the tricycle.  She cannot run a business right now because her children are very young (two years old and seven month old).\r\n\r\nWith loans through ASHI, Lorelyn hopes to one day purchase many tricycles for a transportation business.

One disappointment she has was not going to college; now, she is firm in her decision not to have any more major regrets in life. \r\n\r\nPaulina is married to Carlos, a supervisor. They live as a family in Pasay City, Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nPaulina runs her own sari-sari (variety) store in their community. She has done so for five years, and her neighbors already are familiar with how she conducts her business. Paulina wants to know what her customers want and aims to meet those preferences. She carefully chooses her products and sells them attractively, earning around 10,000 Philippines pesos (PhP) per month.\r\n\r\nKnowing that she needs more finances to keep her business growing, Pauline applied for a Php12,000 loan. She plans to use this to purchase essential goods, such as shampoo, soap, instant noodles, biscuits, and drinks, which her regular customers typically look for. The loan helps in leveraging the profitability of her store and allows her to pay their bills and buy what her family wants.\r\n\r\nTough competition within the vicinity, low sales at certain times of the year, and unpaid debts by some customers are just a few of the problems Paulina has. But she refuses to let these hurdles keep her from obtaining the best she could have. She holds on to her dream of acquiring their own lot, building their own house, having a bigger store with wholesale products, and buying their own car.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":721265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Everly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to sustain her business. Everly is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 3rd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Miranda, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store business. Her husband, Bernie Verzosa, who is 43 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 2 children who are 12 and  20 years old.\r\n\r\nAlicia  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Alicia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stocks for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future household expenses and savings. Alicia  Verzosa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: a general store, selling frozen foods and a RTW dealer (Natasha, Avon) businesses. She has 5 children and all have families of their own. \r\n\r\nHedda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Hedda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25000, which she intends to use to purchase more stocks to sell so that she could continue to save up for the future. Hedda L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married to Nicomedes B., 51, an overseas Filipino worker. Wilma is the mother of two children who are currently studying in high school and college. By the grace of God, Wilma has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send both of them all the way through college. A dream for most Filipino parents, like Wilma, is seeing their children receive a college diploma. Education is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nWilma maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer\u2019s order is bought, in cash, by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are relying on as their income. Wilma\u2019s regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 18,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nWilma dreams to be able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also wants to have her own commercial stall for her direct selling business. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":652763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock for her direct selling business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-11-27T17:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28.33,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1248.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816900},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":6240.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652853},{"amount":113.33,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4992.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191396008},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6240.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814118}],"funded_date":"2010-11-28T04:08:11Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":257119,"name":"Dufatanye Bategarugori Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Rachel Nyiragasiqwa est agricultrice, et elle est un membre du groupe Dutanfane Bategarugori.

Deysi owns a stall in the central market of the area where she lives from which she sells a variety of clothing for all tastes, sizes, and preferences. She is a hard-working, responsible woman. She has many customers thanks to the charisma and kindness which characterize her. The location of the stall is very strategic as it is located on the border of the street and is very busy. She has worked very hard for many years to collaborate with the finances of her home as they are not enough to support and provide her family with adequate conditions with the earnings that her husband receives. She has made the decision to apply to Integral for a loan in order to invest in her stall by buying a variety of clothing like pants, skirts, undergarments, blouses, shirts, etc. so that her business will be more attractive and will manage to attract more customers with the objective of attaining an increase in the level of sales, in this way being able to better the condition of her life and that of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":876786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The idea to start up this business came from her desire to stand out and help her husband with the family income. At the start, she only sold fizzy drinks and any profit she made she invests back into the business to buy more products. During this time she had a dream to have a shop, but one with a larger selection of goods. Just two years ago, with the help of EDAPROSPO she can see the profits, although she still dreams about a shop. Margarita\u2019s aim is to have a larger sale stand in a market, within a couple of years. But she knows that it will take at least a few years for her dream to become a reality.

She has three children: two sons, both of whom work, and one daughter, who is a school student.\r\n\r\nAbout a year ago Dinara started her own business of cattle raising. She bought two calves and now these calves have gained weight and in fall she is going to have them sold or slaughtered for meat. She wants to expand her business and needs a loan to build a new yard for her cattle as the one she has at the moment is in a bad condition. This yard is not suitable for her cattle in wintertime and therefore she is taking precautionary measures now, so that she does not lose her cattle in winter.\r\n\r\nShe says that having a business apart from a regular job helps her be constantly active and motivated. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group include Mairamkul, Gulyasyl, Kachkyn and Gulmira.\r\n\r\nMairamkul is a married woman aged 51. She owns a small shop and besides that makes national carpets. She needs a loan to rebuild her yard for her cattle and to increase its area.\r\n\r\nGulyasyl is a housewife.

All of her children have their own families, but she prefers to live independent of her children.\r\n\r\nKachkyn is the mother of four children and works in construction. At the same time she manages to breed cattle for which she has ten-years of experience. She has a pretty decent income and now needs a loan to purchase some more cows.\r\n\r\nGulmira also works at a construction site in the capital. She used to work as a masseuse. Then she bought some calves and started cattle raising. She wants to purchase some more calves to raise them for her son\u2019s wedding and then to resell the rest. \r\n\r\nAs can be seen, all the members of this group combine two or more jobs and that makes them even more passionate about their plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Her family lives in the home she inherited from her parents.  Her desire to succeed motivated her to work in several different places throughout the city.  At the moment, she manages two automobiles \u2013 one to use for public transportation and the other for her own personal use.  Maritza and her partner share the responsibilities of running their business in hopes that they will both reap the benefits.  However, their transportation service was not complete until they acquired some motorcars, which are operated by their children.  In addition to managing her business, Maritza also works as a cook at a convent in the mornings, a job that helps to supplement her income.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of Maritza\u2019s greatest wishes is to augment her transportation business by purchasing another automobile, since repairs and lost revenues due to mechanical failures have hurt her family income.  She is requesting her sixth loan from Microfinanzas PRISMA and hopes that the additional support will improve her financial condition.  The attitudes she developed working with her Communal Bank have helped her cope with her situation.

She is 54 and a widow who already has a grandson. Now she is an owner of a chemist\u2019s shop. The family budget enlarges with the help of a cattle-breeding business. Her son actively helps to run his mother's business. During the past two years, Ryskul has managed to buy furniture. In order to develop her business she needs to buy hay for cattle feeding. That\u2019s why she wants to get a loan. In the future, her plans include obtaining a new car. \n\nGulshat B., 36, is married. Her husband's profession is farming. Together, the couple has three children, all of whom are school pupils. Gulshat has chosen to work in the sphere of medicine; she works as a nurse in a hospital. But in order to cover family expenses, she has to earn money additionally by cattle breeding. Out of those proceeds, the family has managed to build a new house and to obtain a refrigerator and a washing machine. The loan's purpose is for stocking up hay for the winter. In the future, she is planning to buy a car.\n\nSaltanat U. has the status of the group\u2019s treasurer. She is 34 and a widow who has raised two sons by herself. Luckily, she gets material support from her brother and her older son. But after the big tragedy, her husband's death, she decided not to give up and she has opened a small shop. This business gives her 6000 soms per month. Moreover, Saltanat makes her bread by working as a mail carrier. She has managed to buy necessary household appliances: a clothes washer, a refrigerator and a vacuum cleaner. The loan's purpose is to increase cattle stock by obtaining more farm animals (2500 soms per animal). In the future, she plans to build a household room. \n\nShailogul T., 31, is married and her spouse is a farmer. Today, she raises money by taking orders at home and offering a sewing service. During the years of working hard, the members of the family together have managed to make house repairs, to buy a television set and a carpet. The loan's purpose is to obtain a sewing machine and stuff. Planning for the future, Shailogul wants to buy a kitchen set and a refrigerator. \n\nWhere Did This Loan Come From?\n\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple \"P\" bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).
