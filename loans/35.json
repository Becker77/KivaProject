(the first person on the left in the photograph) organized a retirement home called \u201cSunshine\u201d for people between the ages 60-90 years old. She started 5 months ago, after her mother\u2019s death. \u201cI didn\u2019t give all the warmth and care I could to my own parents, so I am giving it today to my new guests,\u201d Tatiana says. Today, Tatiana has 11 elderly people in the home and 5 staff workers. \r\n\r\n<P>Tatiana financed the retirement home entirely with her own money. The local government provided an old building (a former kindergarten) to use free of charge for fifteen years. Tatiana managed to make some small renovations in the building. She bought 20 beds (the total capacity is 60 people) and purchased equipment for the kitchen and dining room. Because \u201cSunshine\u201d does not have enough cash assets, all of the workers work for free and hope to be paid a salary when better times come. Nowadays, the retirement home exists only with the aid of the retiree\u2019s pensions.<\/P> \r\n\r\n<P>Tatiana hopes to use loan money to purchase a cow and two sheep. Milk and meat from the livestock will be used for cooking. Also, some amount of milk and meat can be sold in the market. Additional food and all the necessary materials will be purchased. Also, Tatiana expects the older people to participate in the process of livestock breeding in order to fill their free time with an interesting hobby.<\/P> \r\n\r\n<P>Tatiana S. is married and has three sons. She and her husband operate the retirement home and their sons try to help whenever they have free time. Tatiana comments: \u201cI love this house. I feel like someone is protecting it.\u201d<\/P>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":335386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To breed livestock, which will supply her retirement home with milk and meat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kemin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2009-06-15T04:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tatiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Galina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":9013},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":9386},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":9775},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10181},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":10603},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":11042}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.3},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.01},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.08},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.4},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":210.3,"local_amount":9013,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":9064.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52988559},{"amount":219.01,"local_amount":9386,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":9439.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73638928},{"amount":228.08,"local_amount":9775,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:14:45Z","rounded_local_amount":9830.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87078238},{"amount":237.56,"local_amount":10181,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10238.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96993925},{"amount":247.4,"local_amount":10603,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":10663.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103838912},{"amount":257.65,"local_amount":11042,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":11104.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110730702}],"funded_date":"2009-06-15T18:59:16Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:16:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"June Blender","image":123338}},{"id":119172,"name":"Lulai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lulai T., 45, is married with 5 children.

Since both schools from the villages of Mabanta and Makama operate on the same payroll, they have merged to seek a loan from Kiva through SMT.  <P>\r\n\r\nTeachers from these institutions, like many other teachers within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest  in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.<P>\r\n\r\nFifty-four-year-old Solomon S. K. (right) is the head master at the school.  He was born in a village called Rogbin. He is married with 3 children, 2 of whom are in Junior Secondary Schools II (JSS II) while the eldest is in a Teachers' Training College pursuing a Higher Teachers\u2019 Certificate.

Jovita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12000 PHP from GDMPC and is now requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Jovita from GDMPC.

It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Though Loda\u2019s husband supports her and her children financially, the woman still wants to be productive in her own way to support her own education and the needs of her children. Her husband\u2019s income is yet too small to support things her family needs to be able to experience life beyond poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nWhen Loda joined ASHI in 2003, she requested a loan to start a \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store, selling inventories of foodstuffs, beverages and other basic commodities for people in their village to purchase conveniently. Frequently her business can't be sustained and she has had to periodically shut it down. The loans she has received have been a great help in restoring her business. Despite those circumstances, Loda makes sure that she maintains an excellent repayment record with ASHI and attends the weekly ASHI center meetings. Assisted by her husband in fulfilling her responsibilities to ASHI,  Loda is now requesting a loan to improve her business and to fully achieve her dream of making it sustainable and profitable to be

Seven years ago, she began making handcrafted wallets and even her children helped out in whatever way they could.  Today one of her children is responsible for making the designs, another secures the studs and etches the designs, and she handles the sewing and making the finishing touches to each of the wallets.  Whenever they receive large orders, they must work together and strive to deliver on time.  One of her children is in charge of maintaining samples of what they have created in order to show to new buyers.

She successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI which she used to purchase piglets to raise and sell in the future.

farmers in Webuye District, Kenya.

He is married and has two children.\r\n\r\nWith a portion of this loan, Benard will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Jose has produced dragon fruit for ten years.  He cultivates the land with a plow, organizing it into rows and path ways.  He carefully cares for it, eliminating pests and sicknesses which so often affect the ground and damage the crop.\r\n<p>\r\nThe production of dragon fruit is a very expensive process due to the necessity of many fertilizing chemicals.  Jose\u2019s experience in the working the land has provided him with the knowledge of the entire production process, even up to the final marketing of the fruit.  It is with this knowledge that Jose also decided to begin producing a small amount of pineapple as well.  He sells his crops at the various nearby community markets.\r\n<p>\r\nSince Jose\u2019s wife is the individual who helps him to sell their crop, Jose needs to prepare his land in order to get his crop of dragon fruit out to the market.  It is in this business that Jose Armengol has managed to better his family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Casey Unrein, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nEl se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9 tiene 35 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en la comunidad de San Caralampio, zona rural, monta\u00f1osa, propicia para el cultivo de pitahaya. Se dedica a esta actividad desde hace 10 a\u00f1os.  Prepara el terreno con las labores de arado, rastra, delineado y hoyado, cuida de la maleza y elimina  plagas y enfermedades que suelen afectar el suelo y da\u00f1ar la cosecha. El proceso productivo de la pitahaya es muy costoso, ya que se requiere de comprar muchos insumos qu\u00edmicos necesarios para fertilizar el suelo. El tiempo de trabajar en las tierras le ha permitido conocer todo el proceso de preparaci\u00f3n hasta comercializaci\u00f3n del fruto, es as\u00ed que tambi\u00e9n se dedica a producir pi\u00f1a en menor cantidad. Su cosecha la ofrece a los diferentes mercados de las comunidades cercanas. Don Jos\u00e9 necesita preparar la tierra para sacar al mercado la cosecha de pitahaya que esta por reproducir, ya que su esposa es la que le ayuda a ofrecerla en los mercados.

He grew up in a typical family environment, however, his father passed away when he was 10 years old, and he  says he started to have difficulties studying because he didn't have anyone to support him.  His only option was to look for work so in 1963 he was hired at the Industrial Plastic Company where he worked until he retired.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 1969 he married and moved to Catembe with his wife where they had children referenced above.  He continued working for his company as a mechanic.   He began searching for a way to keep himself busy opening a workshop to provide various services in the metal working arena with a lathe and saw in his back yard.  His level of service is good.<p>\r\n\r\nHe came to know Hluvuku through his brother that happens to be a client and has already had several loans which were paid off without problems.  With this loan of 20MT he intends to purchase a machine to cut metal for his workshop that is open at 8am and closes at 6pm depending on the demand and favorable economic conditions.  His monthly profit is around 3MT and with these earnings he is able to support a family, pay the loan, and still make some improvements on the machinery.  In the future he envisions opening a shop to wash, lubricate, and align wheels and other services and may possibly need credit.<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva

This is 32-year-old Janeth M. from Mwanza. She is married with three children between the ages of two and 10. Janeth has been running a milling machine since 2000. Farmers come from the surrounding area to provide their corn to be ground into maize. Maize is very important to the Tanzanian culture: it is used to make one of their staple dishes, ugali, which is made solely of maize flour and water. Janeth works at the business for 12 hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by two employees. She currently earns about 50 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase large sacks to store the ground maize which she sells in bulk. Janeth thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is married and has one adult child.  To make a living, Leonia owns & operates a business raising cattle for sale.  Leonia has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 2000 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Leonia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Leonia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional animals.  Leonia is now requesting a new loan of 2200 WST, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.  The loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Leonia from SPBD.  Leonia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Thanks to all of these years, she has regular customers and she can get daily income.  Also, three years ago she bought a \u201cmotocarro\u201d (a three wheeled motorized cart).  A year later she bought another one.  Two of her sons work with these vehicles transporting passengers.  Every day they give their earnings to Luz to manage.\r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan with MFP.

old. Their children are: Marisol, age 15 and Mary Joy, age 13, both still studying; Elmer, age 32, now married; Melvin, age 30, also married; and Mary Ann, age 22, still single.\r\n\r\nCelerina\u2019s husband has been working continuously as a security guard in Taytay Rizal for fifteen years now and this was the one source of their income. But, because they have more expenses in their house plus the expenses of two children in school, Celerina had to think of another way to augment her husband\u2019s insufficient salary.\r\n\r\nThe solution that Celerina thought of is to start a business that fits their place to produce an extra income. But one of her dilemmas in starting the business was a lack of capital for it. Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) is the one who solved her dilemma.\r\n\r\nCelerina joined ASHI in 2004 and the loan that she received from the institution was used as capital to start the business that she thought of, which is food preparation. Now she wants to again use a loan to improve her business. She wants to buy some necessary things needed in her business like a different bowl where the menu is placed. She also wants to diversify her menu for a much bigger income.\r\n\r\nCelerina does everything to make her business grow more. She exerts more effort with the help of her daughter, Mary Ann. Celerina is the one who will buy the ingredients in the afternoon and cook them the next morning and Mary Ann will sell the food. Celerina really does everything to make her business grow in order for her children, and also her grandchildren, to experience a better life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":405023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

By working hard in her restaurant business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000.

She is married to Ramil, a graphic artist, and is mother to her only child. She, together with her husband, manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMarivic operates an LPG business. What she basically does is buy liquefied petroleum gas tanks from wholesalers and sells them per tank with a little profit. LPG tanks can range from small to regular size tanks. Aside from this, she also retails electronic cellphone loads (prepaid cellphone credits) and offers direct selling products. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 41,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more stock of LPG tanks to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarivic dreams of having other branches someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies there.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Mrs. Sokvorn C. is the village bank president wH. has been selected by the members. She is a farmer wH. owns a piece of land to cultivate both rice and vegetables. In her vegetable growing she faces an obstacle because she does not have vegetable seeds for growing. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy vegetable seeds to grow on the field. Her husband, Mr. Nget Thy, is a driver for a garment factory. Mrs. Srey O. did not come to take a loan but her husband was, so he is presented in the picture instead. \r\n\r\nOne member in this group loan is an end-of-term loan and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able.

Her husband works as an independent welder but does not earn enough to pay for household expenses or for their children's education. That's why she decided to help him by opening her business, which she started twelve years ago.\r\n\r\nAt first, Kunduz sold to her neighbors and, little by little, her business has been growing and now she sells in the markets. Her oldest daughter helps her in the business and wishes to continue to make it grow.\r\n\r\nKunduz is requesting a loan for 12,300 Somoni to purchase fresh vegetables for making salads. She and her family are very grateful for the support that you give to allow them to continue their business and improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have three children:  Ezer, 22 years old, Wilder, who is 19, and Gisela, 16.  They live in a house they own, located in the eastern part of Per\u00fa.\r\n\r\nTogether with the whole family, she dedicates herself to growing bananas, coffee and avocado.  She has been farming since she was very young, having learned the trade from her parents.  The crops she grows are the most produced in her region of the country.\r\n\r\nFelicita\u2019s greatest wish is for her children to pursue their studies in the city, since in the zone where they live there are not many opportunities for a good education.  In addition, she would like them to have the many things that she and her husband never managed to have in life.  Felicita enjoys her work because she is doing it on her own land, and she can harvest her crops without any problems.  In addition, she enjoys working with her husband and children who help her generate a good income for the family.  She sells her products to wholesalers who pay a good price for seasonal products.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth time she\u2019s had a loan with MFP, and she promises to be responsible with her repayments as she would like access to credit in the future to reach her goals.

She lives with her youngest child, who is 15 years old, and cares for him.  Together with her husband, they all live together in a house they own.  For the past 5 years, she has run a business selling coal.  Since starting up, she has not stopped working, and travels great distances in order to obtain her product.  The coal is then sold to the brick factories that are plentiful in the area where she lives.  This raw material serves as fuel for the large condensation ovens that are common in these factories.\r\n\r\nThis enterprise has given her good results due to the great demand for coal.  For this reason, she constantly buys the material and stockpiles it on the porch of her home.  Her immediate plan is to buy the coal in greater quantities.  This is her second credit with MFP, and she promises to be very responsible with her loan payments.  In addition, she feels this contribution will be very helpful to her in growing her business.  She plans to purchase a truckload of coal with the loan she is requesting.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":525734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more coal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-19T11:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":184}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":195.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718261},{"amount":68.94,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":195.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751947},{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":195.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934402},{"amount":137.87,"local_amount":376,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":390.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886999},{"amount":137.86,"local_amount":376,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":390.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449301},{"amount":67.47,"local_amount":184,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":191.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588033}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T22:22:00Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":197905,"name":"Ny's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group loan consists of four people located in Prey Rumdeng village in Takeo province.

For three years, this enterprising mother has been selling a variety of meals in her area.  Every day, after cooking in her home, she wraps up her pots, takes them out on her cart and starts selling her meals: 'chanfainita' (a traditional Peruvian dish), 'tallarines rojos' (another traditional Peruvian dish - literally 'red noodles'), and chicken stews.  Over time, she has been able to attract a lot of customers who enjoy her delicious meals, above all the drivers at the 'mototaxi' (auto rickshaw) stands.\r\n\r\nWhat Maribel most likes about her work is that it is very profitable and, for that reason, she has been able to hire a young lady to help her.  However, she is also worried about the increase in the number of itinerant street vendors who also sell meals and who have set up near her business.  For this reason, in the future she is thinking of renting premises and setting up a restaurant so that she can proviD. her customers with a better service.\r\n\r\nThis is Maribel's 13th loan with MFP and she has pledged, once again, to be responsible in making her loan repayments.

A mother of 4 children, she became a widow 30 years ago when her husband Andr\u00e9s died. She now lives in her own house with her beloved son Henry in the town of Huayounioc. With a lot of efforts Marcelina was able to open a small caf\u00e9 in the town of Huayounioc, and with the help of her deceased husband she was able to fit it very well, little by little transforming it in a very well-known and popular place. The food she serves is very good, and for this reason her caf\u00e9 is attended by many customers. She sells coffee, panqueques (a sort of pancake maD. with flour) and drinks, which she sells mainly at night. Keeping her shop clean is what she loves the most about her job. She has been running this activity for 10 years and she thinks the most difficult part is to serve many people at the same time, as sometime she finds it hard to keep up with it. She also said she engages in breeding cows and small animals such as sheep, then selling their meat and milk. Every morning she goes to town to buy the manure they need, and being a good country woman she also engages in growing potatoes, maize and carrots on a small scale, as she has not so much time to dedicate to this because of her many activities. In the future she wishes to be able to save enough to lead a peaceful life in her old age. She is a member of the Banco Comunal \u201cProgreso Huayounioc\u201d (\u201cHuayounioc Progress\u201d Communal Bank), and this is the sixth loan she has requested to MFP.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Nyoman Switra","description":{"languages":["id"],"texts":{"id":"I Nyoman Switra has been farming chicken since 2005.  He farms chicken to be slaughtered that takes about 35-40 days from birth to slaughter.  An average mature chicken weighs about 2kg and can be sold for $1 per kg.  I Nyoman Switra farms about 4000 chickens.  He is assisted by his wife and a contract worker that he pays about $110 per harvest.  I Nyoman Switra's chicken farm is his family's only source of income since he retired from his post as his village head.  He gets decent income from the farm, but it also carries significant risk as his chickens are vulnerable to disease and his yield can vary with temperature and weather.  Therefor he needs to keep up the environment and spend some money on vaccines and drugs.  Each harvest, I Nyoman Switra can earn up to $110 to $170 by selling his chickens to larger wholesaler who has been I Nyoman's regular client.  \r\n\r\nI Nyoman Switra needs additional fund to afford higher price of feeds and to renovate his chicken cages.  He hopes that his chicken farm can grow.  He needs to pay for his children's tuition.  One of his children is currently in college, and the other is still in Junior high school.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\nBeternak ayam telah di tekuni I Nyoman Switra Sejak tahun 2005 . Ayam yang di pelihara adalah  ayam pedaging. Masa pertumbuhan ayam ini dari   sejak lahir hingga siap panen berkisar 35 sampai 40 hari , dengan berat badan rata-rata 2 kg sedangkan harga perkilogramnya Rp 9.200,- . I Nyoman Switra memelihara 4.000 ekor ayam. Ia di bantu oleh istri serta seorang tenaga kerja yang di gaji sebesar Rp. 1.000.000,- per sekali panen . Memelihara ayam bagi I Nyoman Switra adalah satu \u2013satunya sumber pendapatan keluarga sejak dia pensiun menjadi kepala dusun . Hasil yang di peroleh pun sangat menjanjikan . Namun resiko yang dihadapi juga cukup tinggi karena ayam jenis ini sangat rentan dengan serangan penyakit dan sangat terpengaruh pada suhu \/cuaca ,sehingga memerlukan lingkungan yang sehat dan juga modal yang cukup untuk persediaan obat-obatan ataupun vaksin. Dalam sekali panen I Nyoman Switra meraup keuntungan berkisar  1 sampai 1,5 juta rupiah. Sedangkan hasil panen  I Nyoman Switra  langsung diambil oleh pedagang besar yang sudah menjadi pelanggan tetap .   \r\nI Nyoman Switra memerlukan tambahan modal untuk membeli pakan ayam yang saat ini semakin mahal dan juga untuk merenopasi kandangnya yang sudah mulai rapuh , Dan besar harapan I Nyoman Switra peternakan ayamnya bisa lebih berkembang ,sehingga dapat menunjang biaya pendidikan anaknya yang kini telah duduk di bangku kuliah dan satu lagi masih SMP."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":131134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

He is 20 years old and lives at home with his parents, whom he wants to help with family expenses and feels responsible for giving them tranquility in old age. Although he is still very young, he already has familiarized himself in the commerce of seasonings. He has seven years experience in the activity and does it with a lot of pleasure since he knows he will be able to help his parents with expenses. He divides his time between his business and his university studies, which he does not neglect because he wants to be a good professional and not disappoint his parents. What he most enjoys is that with the business his parents don't have to work more than what's necessary and they have more time to themselves. His goal is to grow his business and have a very large store where he can sell her seasonings and condiments. Grinding is the most difficult part of his work because the spices can get into the air and irritate his eyes, but he knows that he has to continue what he has started and wants to work very hard to make headway.

Nonetheless, she still takes care of them as their mother.  Flor has been selling clothes and shoes since she was a young woman.  She worked in several shops where she gained experience in this business.  This eventually led to her decision to start a shoe sales business from her home, where she meets the demands of her neighbors and friends who continually visit.  \r\n<p>\r\nLately her working capital has been dwindling as a result of health problems, but she continues to work in order to recoup as much of her investment as possible so that she can buy more merchandise.  She hopes to start selling shoes in other parts of the country, especially areas outside of the capital where the population is poor and has limited access to clothing and shoes of good quality.  Flor continues to work with a high level of enthusiasm because sales is one of her favorite activities.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Flor\u2019s 10th loan with MFP.

This work is very agreeable to him, since raising animals is the trade he has enjoyed most ever since he was a young boy. Nevertheless, Abdusamat has other jobs as well, and one of these is farming. He grows potatoes and onions in their respective seasons, and he is diligent about taking into account the bad weather that could damage his crops. \r\n<p>\r\nAbdusamat requires a certain amount of money in order to increase the number of his cattle.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and was the site of the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country, home to epic mountain passes, contains communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and its civilization dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve the country\u2019s agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Luzviminda has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Luzviminda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luzviminda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Luzviminda is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Luzviminda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar un cami\u00f3n de abono org\u00e1nico (gallinaza) y productos agroqu\u00edmicos, con el dinero que tenia compro un veh\u00edculo y para la siembra no tienen capital para comprar los insumos agr\u00edcolas, ellos piensan no volver m\u00e1s a la comunidad donde viv\u00edan mas antes.","en":"Tomas, age 32, has been married to Carmen for ten years.  They have lived  in Colomi in the Duraznos Pampa community for over six years.  They have two children, ages nine and seven.  The children go to elementary school.\n\nHe and his wife tell us that they used to live in the Ayopaya municipality.  It did not have sufficient economic resources, not even for their children\u2019s education.  In their area, farming production, it went very poorly for them.  There were a lot of diseases in their crops, which caused total losses.  Therefore, Tomas and his wife decided to move to the Duraznos Pampa community in the Colomi municipality.\n\nNow they do not have financial problems planting potatoes and chilies.  They take them to sell at the weekly fair in Colomi, and an assortment of vegetable is for feeding their family.\n\nThey came to CIDRE\u2019s office to request a loan to buy a truckload of organic fertilizer (poultry manure) and agrochemical products.  They used the money they had to buy a vehicle, and they do not have the money to buy agricultural supplies for planting.  They do not plan on returning to the community where they used to live.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need. <p>\r\n\r\nTo learn more about IMON International's work, please visit:

Rosalind has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rosalind joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalind is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like biscuits & junk foods. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Rosalind from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the  business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":669297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional products to sell like biscuits & junk foods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Mambajao, Camiguin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":128,"posted_date":"2010-12-18T13:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalind","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":829.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188696287},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191434966},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195854076},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201295937},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206164218}],"funded_date":"2010-12-18T18:50:01Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:12:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":263481,"name":"Freddy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El sr.

El trabajo al que se dedica est\u00e1 abnegada mujer es la venta de frutas de toda variedad. Constantemente viaja a la ciudad de Tarma, donde vende frutas al menudeo, pues en la sierra del pa\u00eds no se encuentran estas frutas, por ello en cada viaje que realiza le brinda buenas ganancias. Asimismo se dedica a la crianza de animales menores como gallinas, patos y cuyes, que tambi\u00e9n son animales muy escasos en la selva central, por ella la venta de carne de estos animales obtiene regulares ganancias mayores al dinero invertido. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta, es \u201ctrabajar\u201d, pues le gusta mantenerse ocupada, es por eso que ahora tiene planeado sembrar mango, con lo que podr\u00e1 variar la venta de diferentes frutas.

Despite her age she continues to work to get ahead since her children have formed their own families and are independent.  She works and lives in her own home on the outskirts of the city of San Ram\u00f3n (Peruvian central forest).  This self-sacrificing woman works selling all types of fruit.  She travels constantly to the city of Tarma where she sells fruit retail.  The type of fruit she sells is hard to find in the mountain area so she makes a good profit everytime she travels there.  \r\n\r\nShe also raises small animals such as hens, ducks and guinea pigs, which are also scarce in the central forest.  Income on sales of these types of animals is greater than money invested.

She joined One Acre Fund in order to ensure food security for her family and access fertilizer and hybrid seeds. In the 2011 season, Eunice had an excellent maize yield harvesting 16 bags on three quarters of an acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, she was only able to harvest five bags of maize on that land. \r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Eunice will educate her children and pay back her loan. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Neema C group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and one acre of land. \r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, Eunice is pictured with her group members, plus a child of one of the group members.

district of Chucuito, Puno, Peru.  She is 50 years old and is widowed and still cares for one of her five children (the rest have their own families).  She has worked with the Manuela Ramos movement for the last 5 years.  Her business is to buy and sell material and cloth.  Her first loan was for 300 soles which she used to buy merchandise (different quality cloth) from the city of La Paz, Bolivia.  Today she sells her merchandise in the cities of Arequipa and Puno.  She has to transport her products there and this is why she needs more capital to increase her business.  She is asking for a loan for 3,000 soles, which she will repay in three installations.  With the loan she will buy more material from Bolivia and sell it to wholesalers.  In the future she hopes to have her own home in Desaguadero or Arequipa and to continue working constantly until she has a large business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":286923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buy material\/cloth","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-03-17T22:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3054.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52984910}],"funded_date":"2009-03-18T01:22:34Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:22:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":98756,"name":"Awo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Awo M. is thirty-nine years old.

Azamat is a young man who, little by little, reaches his goals through perseverance and dedication. Thanks to his personal strengths and desire to provide a better future for his family, he has progressed from salesman to becoming his own boss. Approximately two years ago, Azamat rented a place which had deteriorated badly, with terrible conditions, and there he started his business. Since then, he has expanded his grocery and now it is one of the best known groceries in his community. \r\n<p>\r\nAzamat is now requesting a loan of $400 US with a term of 12 months, to increase the stock of foodstuffs in his store. Azamat is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices, and push every once in a while, to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Together with her husband, she has done this work for more than five years.  When construction began on a rice thresher, she was motivated to request financing in order to be able to participate as a partner in this project.  She is sure that this will allow her to take maximum advantage of her own rice production, which will allow her to improve her family's standard of living, because she is the mother of 2 young children who will soon be starting school.

S. is 46 years old and lives with her two children, aged 19 and 6 respectively, in the Am\u00e9ricas Central neighborhood, which is located to the south-west of Bogot\u00e1, near the Metropolitano de Techo stadium, home to the La Equidad team, which is a soccer team from Bogot\u00e1.  Luz runs a general store called the Distrilac El Paisa.  This name refers to the Paisas, habitants of Antioquia, the region around Medell\u00edn.\r\n\r\nThis is Luz's first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she wants to use it to buy soda and other groceries like plastic cups and plates to sell in her store.  She started her business selling soda wholesale, which she distributed to small shops and grocery stores.  Her neighbors and peers, however, recommended that thanks to the location of her home, it would be a good idea to set up a general store in addition to her other business.  Luz opened her store a year ago with great success and a positive reception, thanks in part to her close location to the stadium, which has allowed her to further expand her sales.  Her store is now her largest source of revenue and she hopes this business grows even more, so she can buy the house she lives and works in.  She is also very happy right now because her son just started college on a full merit scholarship. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julia Kastner, Kiva

she was thus encouraged to join KIVA partner, ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap Inc.) in the Philippines, in 1995.\r\n\r\nThe previous loans Adelaida received from ASHI were carefully invested in her sari-sari (variety) store. Since then, her business has been performing well and earning her sufficient profit. She is grateful that she has been able to educate her children using proceeds from her business as it continues to expand. She needs a loan to help enhance her business to increase her profit.\r\n\r\nNow requesting her tenth loan, Adelaida is requesting 45,000 pesos as supplementary capital for her sari-sari (variety) store, to be used to pay for an inventory of groceries for her enterprise. Her business has been very helpful in achieving her dreams for her children. For her, it is pleasure to see achievement in her business and family; with her children growing she will want to see them having the best in life.\r\n\r\nAdelaida is happy that her living conditions are better than in the past because she was able to generate more income from her business. She is also happy because she is able to nourish and support her husband to meet the needs of the family. She would like to send her best wishes to all her lenders around the world. She hopes that they will support her again in the future.\r\n\r\nAdelaida\u2019s future goals are to purchase a new tricycle (three-wheeled vehicle) for her husband to earn more income for their family. With her hard work and determination, she is hopeful that her businesses will continue to be more productive and that it will improve the overall standard of living for her whole family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":551002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling the items at a piece rate.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP11, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She will also invest a portion of the loan to buy woodworking supplies. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nChona dreams to be able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":618749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

fattening business. She lives in Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000. Rosie is borrowing PHP 29,000 to buy feed for the pigs and stock for her store. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.

For the past two years she has had a produce business, selling from a stand in her neighborhood market. It is located thirty minutes away, by car. In order to acquire the produce and tubers that she needs, she sets out at 4am to the wholesalers market in Lima (La Parada), where she makes her purchases in wholesale. At 7am she arrives at her stand and she sells until 2pm with her daughter\u2019s help.  This is how Bernardina is able to acquire good earnings, with which she is able to pay the rental fee of her stand without any problems.  She loves her business, especially when the stand is stacked with fresh vegetables and tubers. It is urgent for her to supply her business with various sacks of potatoes, a product that is always varying in price. Her objective is to expand her business. This is her ninth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she is committed to making her payments in a timely manner.

is a single mother who supports herself and her sixteen-year-old son through her shoe and textiles sales business. She has operated her business since her son was one year old. Her little sales kiosk is located at the large central market in Kharkiv. Svetlana has learned much in her 15 years as an entrepreneur. She knows her products and has a reputation for offering good service and for being kind and considerate toward her customers. Her desire is to maintain an inventory of good quality products at prices that her customers can afford.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nSvetlana has been an excellent client with Nadiya Ukraine. She has received 15 loans in all and has paid each one back with no delinquencies. She is grateful for the financial assistance, which has been instrumental in the growth and stability of her business.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nSvetlana has requested a loan for $1200 to add to her available purchasing capital. Springtime is a very busy shopping time in Ukraine. The already busy markets get even busier as many shoppers get out to buy things for spring and summer. Svetlana would like to be able to maintain an adequate product inventory during this time so that this will be a profitable season for her and her small business.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0421\u0432\u0456\u0442\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u2013 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0454 16-\u0440\u0456\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Most of her customers are farmers and fishermen, since the major sources of livelihood in this area are farming and fishing.\r\n\t\r\nTwice a week, she goes to the town of Ilagan to purchase needed commodities. To cross Lullutan River, she must ride a ferryboat. \u201cBringing back the purchased items is very risky, costly, and time consuming.

Later, her aunt encouraged her to start her own business so that all of her earnings would be hers. It took a while for Clara to warm to the idea, but she finally did, and she has never regretted the decision, since she now has a good income and is able to help her husband with the household expenses.

The prices are very good and they allow her to have considerable earnings.  In spite of being very tired from her work, every morning she goes to the entry of the market.  She has a rented space there where she happily offers her merchandise until midday.  Also, on the weekends she sells fish in the wholesale market in her district  .\r\n\r\nCarmen hopes that the savings she has been accumulating will allow her to get a stable place in the market so that she will no longer be exposed to the danger of the delinquency that exists in her zone.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  Together with her colleagues from the community bank, she works arduously to increase her earnings.  The work team they comprise is functioning very responsibly.  The 1,200 PEN will be used to buy garments for the winter.  This way she will increase her sales.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":335867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-15T01:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":200.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990773},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":200.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211883},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":200.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641410},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":200.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080849},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":200.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996990},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":200.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842329}],"funded_date":"2009-06-15T16:44:25Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":119252,"name":"Voita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Voita T., 36, is married and has four children.

That is how she is now in business for herself and takes advantage of the offers to get the products and sell them at catalog prices, earning more. Now she has a very faithful clientele. She sells for cash and on credit, with payments daily, weekly, bi-monthly, or monthly. \r\n\r\nWith this loan of 1000 Soles she will buy beauty products like colognes, nail polish, costume jewelry like earrings, necklaces,and rings. She will also buy cologne for men on special offer, and a display case to be able to show and care for her products. She wants to supply her business and provide good service to her clients so they can find what they need. \r\n\r\nMiguelina dreams of expanding this business and getting to be a star seller in order to earn good prizes. She thanks Manuela Ramos for helping her to set up her business and also for helping the many women who want to advance themselves personally and in business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":375379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"She will buy catalog products to increase her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Bagua - Amazonas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-4.5 -78.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-08-23T23:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":172.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635745},{"amount":58.22,"local_amount":166.34,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":171.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074905},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":172.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990269},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":166.99,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":172.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835195},{"amount":58.22,"local_amount":166.35,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":171.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726981},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":172.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118117508}],"funded_date":"2009-08-24T01:26:48Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Burke","image":11816}},{"id":135679,"name":"Poni","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Poni C. is currently in the business of selling paste, tomatoes, okra, etc., and is requesting a loan to improve on the stock.

Makhsuda is 45 years old. She is divorced and the mother of 3 children. For 20 years now, Makhsuda has been selling clothing. She sells socks for men and children in the central local market. Makhsuda spends the income from her business for educating of her children as she is dreaming that her children will have a higher education. <P>\r\n\r\nMakhsuda has been provided with the loans by IMON for 4 years already . For the entire period of time she has shown herself to be an accurate client. Today she is requesting 5000 Somoni ($1150 USD) to purchase new goods for resale. Makhsuda promises to pay the loan back on time and thanks all supporting her. <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

In their second term, they are already showing responsibility and eagerness to get ahead with effort and dedication to their work. Each has economic activities such as selling bread, empanadas, clothes in the market, cosmetics and catalog products. Generally, they carry out their work as street vendors. Others make their living selling gas and with different services such as public passenger transportation, making clothing, and working in different offices in the role of secretary. Their competence depends a lot on the type of product they offer.

Rosa\u2019s daughter is studying medicine.\r\n\r\nRosa is about to launch a new restaurant in Cusco. She previously ran a snack stand catering mostly to university students, but was motivated by her desire to own and run her own restaurant. The area around the restaurant, on the Plaza Tupac Amaru, has several office buildings, a large police station and municipal buildings, so Rosa expects to have many potential customers.\r\n\r\nRosa used her savings to fully equip the restaurant and now needs a loan to buy food and to pay the four employees she will hire.  Rosa plans to launch her restaurant before the New Year. After receiving the loan proceeds, all that will be left will be for her to decide on a name.\r\n\r\nRosa appreciates and thanks you for the loan and promises to pay the monthly repayments on
