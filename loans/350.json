Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. \r\n\r\nTo ensure the future success of her business, Leticia has applied for a PHP 9,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying groceries needed to replenish her current product inventory. She will also invest a portion of the loan to do advance orders on her direct selling line.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education. She also hopes that she will be able to renovate her house with all her hard work on her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":545588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy groceries to replenish current inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-05-26T09:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:00:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2503.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144684750},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3129.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152028650},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2503.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159608069},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821580}],"funded_date":"2010-05-26T10:22:32Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Chaissan","image":null}},{"id":207573,"name":"Phach","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. P. is 26 years old and is a resident of Kompong Tom Province, where he has established a small family with other members.

She was convinced that she needed to work to keep her family going; she started to look for a type of business that would still allow her to fulfill her duties at home and earn extra money.  An acquaintance selling lingerie approached Mar\u00eda so she could refer her to her neighbors.  This is how Mar\u00eda came to sell lingerie and gain some customers, little by little. <p>\r\nToday, she has a number of customers but Mar\u00eda has no money to stock up. Thus, she is requesting a loan of $375, which will be repaid in installments over 6 months.  The loan will be used to buy more lingerie to sell to her new customers who are asking for different types.

Agnes was born in Kabala, Koinadugu district, in northern Sierra Leone. She currently resides in Makeni where she is married and runs her business. Her husband is a teacher and they have four children. Two of the children are in secondary school and two are in primary school. Agnes sells both \u201cgara lappers\u201d (locally dyed cloth with fabricated designs) and eggs. She has been in business for over ten years now. This will be her very first loan through SMT. She is requesting a loan of SSL 2,000,000 to help her strengthen her business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Agnes will expand her business by buying more goods to add to her current stock. She will invest part of the loan in her gara lapper business and part into her egg business. She purchases the eggs in Freetown for SSL 100,000 per carton. The fare to Freetown is SSL 24,000 round trip. There is a SSL 1000 delivery charge for each carton of eggs transported with her from Freetown. \r\n\r\nShe buys the materials used for making gara lappers \u2013 inks, soda, white cotton material, etc. \u2013 here in Makeni.  A piece of white cotton cloth costs her SSL 95,000 in Makeni. She estimates she will be able to get at least nine cartons of eggs and seven pieces of white cotton cloth with the loan.  She will use the balance of the loan to buy inks, soda, and powder and to pay designers to design the white cotton cloth in different styles and patterns. \r\n\r\nThough business on the whole is going fine for Agnes, she does, however, face two great challenges \u2013 bad debtors and sometimes slow sales. Some of her customers refuse to pay her on time while some do not repay their debts at all. This instills fear in her as a businesswoman, making it a challenge for her to know who to trust and who not to trust.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she receives through SMT, Agnes is expecting a vast improvement in her business and an incremental increase in the amount of profit she makes. The increase in profit will be reinvested into the business, some will be saved for future use and the remainder will be used to assist her husband in providing food for their household.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":239811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase supplies of cloth making material and eggs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":135,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-17T08:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":405405,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885075},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20434524},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128917},{"amount":67.49,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025706},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44611609},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008510},{"amount":67.51,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:24:06Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230851},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:40Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662619},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-22T11:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102856}],"funded_date":"2009-01-02T15:18:43Z","paid_date":"2009-10-22T11:11:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":83831,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad is a 27-year-old man who lives in Tyre, southern Lebanon with his wife and their child.

Glicilda is again striving to expand another business, wholesaling vinegar and soy sauce to be delivered to different village stores near them. Thus, she wants to take a loan amounting to PHP 13,000 as business additional capital. Simply committing everything to God, and simply working hard to achieve such an endeavor is an easy way out of the dilemma of poverty, said Glicilda.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These women have met through family ties, and now run a resale business of various articles such as food products, fruits, grains and clothing. After having properly reimbursed 3 previous loans, the women of the Kokadjie group are looking for their fourth loan, which will be used to build up their inventory of food supplies, as well as for the purchase of about three dozen articles of clothing for women and children. They get their supplies in Bamako (the capital of Mali) and in Konobougou from suppliers and wholesellers. They sell their articles in Bouwere (from their houses), in the market of Konobougou, as well as in the surrounding fairs, for cash and credit, to a clientele composed of both men and women. They are looking to make an average monthly profit, of 12.500 FCFA each, that will be used for expenses related to healthcare, food provisioning, and schooling expenses for their families; with the remainder being reinvested in their business operations.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dina Dumenko, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":493347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of various articles for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-02-23T00:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nassoun ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marietou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-18T08:32:40Z","rounded_local_amount":27031.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021675},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":27031.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746466},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":27031.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779003},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:04Z","rounded_local_amount":27031.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961209}],"funded_date":"2010-02-23T01:45:48Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":182970,"name":"Sonia Estela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sonia Estela tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, su actividad econ\u00f3mica es la venta y elaboraci\u00f3n de cosa de horno, hace m\u00e1s de 5 a\u00f1os que se dedica a este negocio, por lo que se hace cargo de su familia.

Elvies has been able to graduate from college. At 36, he is married to Irene, with whom he has three children. Together they live in Tanza, Cavite. To reach those big dreams, one of the steps Elvies took is to become a community partner of CCT.\r\n\r\nElvies runs a mini grocery, a dream for many small variety store owners. He also sells ready-to-wear clothes and school supplies based on the needs of his community. He has been running this business for five years now and is still counting. He manages to run the mini grocery alone, and monthly he earns an average of Php12,000.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operation of his business, he would like to request a Php45,000 loan. With this amount he plans to buy a jeepney of his own with which he can deliver goods or products from one place to another. This will be of great help to his business, both for the mini grocery and the RTW business. The remainder of the loan money will be used to purchase more grocery items to add to his store.\r\n\r\nElvies constantly prays for a second floor to add to their house, because he wants the home to become better than it is at present. Also, it is his desire for his business to become productive and enable him to prepare a good future for his family. Of course, it is easily said than done, but for a person like Elvies who has the passion and determination to reach for his big dreams, nothing is impossible.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":720600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

In 2003, Patrasia established a caf\u00e9 selling local food and drinks, and now requires a loan of $275 in order to purchase ingredients and stocks of soft drinks in bulk. \r\n\r\nWhen you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is.  A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches with the sky as a ceiling.  Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be.  The food is all local - rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana) - and all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":111847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase ingredients and stocks of soft drinks in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-01-09T03:43:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrasia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-23T06:12:13Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-02-23T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":54188,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140930},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-03-23T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":54188,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164593},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":54188,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189691},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":54188,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217754},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":54188,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246733},{"amount":45,"local_amount":49090.91,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":53010,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":275282}],"funded_date":"2008-01-09T06:12:13Z","paid_date":"2008-07-23T09:16:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":34672,"name":"Nurhasanah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nurhasanah, 36 is married to N. and has 2 children.

On the weekends, she makes soup, pork salad, and a variety of foods to sell in order to earn a little more.  She lives with her parents in the Esperanza neighborhood.  She is 19 years old, single, and has a strong desire to get ahead.  One of her goals is to be able to continue her studies.  She will use this financing to invest in the purchase of construction materials such as: stone, sand, iron and cement to make a wall in front of her house for greater security, because many times the gangs in the neighborhood have fights in the street, which is very frightening.  With this wall she will be able to put a barrier between these activities and her house, and also improve its appearance.

For this reason, he needs a loan of 200,000 CRC to buy seeds for planting beans and to hire workers so that he can produce his best crop this year.  Ram\u00f3n says he is pleased and expresses his thanks for the loan since he will be able to take advantage of his land.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Ram\u00f3n is a member of Ku Kwata Communal Credit Enterprise, one of the 100 member organizations that make up EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his first loan and he says that he hopes to continue participating more actively with this organization.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives on Tacna Avenue in Mazocrux, Peru. Modesta is a new member of the Generation 2000 Community Bank. She decided to join because she lacked capital and for the ability to receive a loan. With the loan she is requesting, which she plans to repay within four months, she will purchase one sack of rice, one sack of sugar, one sack of noodles, one package of soft drinks, among other items. Modesta tells us that she does not know her parents, who left her when she was three years. Her mother left her with a childless single mother. There she grew up, dedicating herself to kitchen chores, washing, grazing cattle, etc., until she and her partner started a business buying and selling alpaca meat in Mazocruz at retail. Three years ago she set up a convenience store and from 2006 she also has prepared meals on market days (Fridays and Saturday). Her dream is to purchase a truck so she can transport vegetables and grocery products to the different outdoor markets, and in this way she'll be able to obtain more income for her children's education so they can grow up to be successful.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":208860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase rice, sugar, noodles, soft drinks, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mazocruz, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.75 -69.733333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-08T01:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-22T02:50:17Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":130.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5331006},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":130.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951376},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:47:37Z","rounded_local_amount":130.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224403},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":130.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417126}],"funded_date":"2008-10-08T02:50:17Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T19:49:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":71591,"name":"Rahmonjon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rahmonjon O. is married and has eight children.

E. is living with her entire family in a house of 3 sleeping rooms and one sitting room. E. has faced so many challenges in life such as the death of her parents, school dropout and family problems. These problems made life unpleasant to E. until the year 2006 in which she came to the knowledge of GHAPE and became a member. E. obtained her first loan from GHAPE in the year 2006, which was 20,000 FRS, and received 150,000 FRS in the year 2008; the repayments were made promptly.<p>\r\n\r\nWith a loan of 250,000 FRS, E. plans to buy more yams for 100,000 FRS, plantain and cocoyam for 100,000 FRS, and fruits and vegetables like pineapples, carrots, and bananas for 50,000 FRS. <p>\r\n\r\nE. greatly believes the business will progress because of the experience she has had in the business and the high demand for her goods. With this business, E. helps her community by supplying food to them, reducing their need to travel to the market and even increasing the economic status of her community. She plans to use the profit from the loan to pay for her children's school fees and to feed and clothe her children. Her repayments will commence in the fourth month from the day of disbursement.<p>\r\n\r\nShe prefers to receive loans from GHAPE because of the training GHAPE offers before disbursing loans, the proper follow up that is done when the loan is repaid, and the comfortable method of repayments. <p>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

(second from right) is a thirty-year-old businesswoman who lives about an hour outside of the capital, Santo Domingo, in a city called Los Alcarrizos. She is a coordinator for the Bank of Hope \u201cEncuentro con Jesus\u201d (Encounter with Jesus). While this is the third loan that Luz has taken out with Esperanza International, it is the first loan for many of the other women in her group.\r\n\r\nLuz took out her first group loan in February 2008 and has consistently and persistently made her payments. However, the previous members of her group struggled to accept the responsibilities associated with microfinance and thus the group suffered from solidarity and cooperation problems. Esperanza International utilizes group lending, which means that the other members of the group are held responsible if one member defaults. Luz is excited because she has great hope for the responsibility and solidarity of this new group. She shared that it is directly evident that these women are ready to flourish with the opportunity that microfinance provides and are simultaneously ready to be dependable group members.\r\n\r\nIn February 2008, Luz ran a colmado, a small store that sells primarily durable goods and foods such as rice and potatoes. Almost a year and a half later, Luz now runs a cafeteria where she sells a variety of lunch foods including fresh juices, fried chicken, empanadas (a pastry turnover filled with savory ingredients and baked or fried), and tostados (a tortilla fried in deep fat with various fillings piled on it). Currently, Luz is unable to satisfy the demands of her customers (certainly a good problem to have); thus, she will use her loan to purchase more primary materials so she can expand the amount of food she produces with her mother.\r\n\r\nLuz hopes to use her increased profits to not only expand her business but also to save up to replace her tin roof with a more stable cement block roof since it rains frequently in Los Alcarrizos. This new roof will truly be a manifestation of the stability and improvement that microfinance can foster.\r\n\r\nLuz lives with her husband, who sells construction materials, and her two children (4 and 6). She is excited for her children\u2019s future and wants them to grow up studying hard, attending church, and making good friends. The children are not the only ones studying in this family. In fact, Luz has been taking night classes in the capital. While she is currently between sessions, she plans to resume classes in August. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of Luz N., the Bank of Hope Encuento con Dios, and the microfinance institute Esperanza International, thank you for providing opportunities to those who need it most!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":349316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He lives with his wife and child. Both he and his wife work to support the family. He has owned his own mini-market since 1997. These small stores are common throughout Lebanon and can be found in almost every neighborhood. \r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan of $1000 from the Kiva partner, Ameen s.a.l., to increase his store\u2019s inventory. This will be his first loan from Ameen. He estimates that the loan will help him increase his profit by 15%.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e. blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.).

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

This district is part of Lambayeque Province, which is located an hour away from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nFor the past year, Santos has been providing cargo and passenger transport services using a motorcycle taxi (a vehicle that consists of a motorcycle taxi with an attached cabin for providing transportation services).

The income he receives from this business is used to support his family.\r\n<p>\r\nDue to continued use and the poor condition of the local roads, his vehicle has developed some problems that require urgent repairs to ensure that it operates properly.

They supply themselves from the market gardeners in Werekela and the surrounding area, and sell their goods at the market in Fana at retail and in cash to a clientele composed of women.\r\nThey hope to realize a profit of 10,000 FCFA each at the end of the loan cycle, which will be used to take care of and pay for the education of their children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":279322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bako ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kourou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tenin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ne  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba  B  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50978.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033683},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":25489.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621051},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25489.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020016},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:02Z","rounded_local_amount":25489.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242761},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25489.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678315}],"funded_date":"2009-04-03T12:05:22Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":96183,"name":"Nuevo Milenio Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \"Nuevo Milenio\" esta representado por el se\u00f1or Walter Santos y conformado por 12 miembros D. los cuales su principal actividad es el comercio D. productos como accesorios D. celular, material D. escritorio, cosm\u00e9ticos, abarrotes, dulces y al servicio p\u00fablico D. pasajeros.

She is married, 58 years old, and has five married children.  Gloria used to be a street vendor, selling stockings from a cart in the market, but she had to stop working for a time when she suffered a slipped disk.  Later, she decided to work at home, setting up a small grocery called Bodega Gloria which she has operated for two years.  Gloria needs a 1000-soles loan to buy cold drinks, beer, milk and bags of sugar.  Since starting at Finca, she's learned how to invest and she now invests all her borrowings in merchandise for the business.  She likes the camaraderie of the group and the sense of solidarity that the community bank provides.  Gloria's greatest hope is to be happy both at home and at her bodeguita.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":309270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy merchandise to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-04-24T19:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":168.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44443473},{"amount":54.05,"local_amount":166.32,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T01:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":167.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52953790},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:35:31Z","rounded_local_amount":168.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63171014},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167.01,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":168.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73596382},{"amount":54.06,"local_amount":166.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":167.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87031869},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T20:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":168.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96944315}],"funded_date":"2009-04-24T19:52:58Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T20:15:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":108471,"name":"Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"L.

Con el pr\u00e9stamo que solicita, lo invertir\u00e1 para construir un kiosko y comprar m\u00e1s productos para abastecer su puesto de ventas. ","en":" Carmen is 52 years old, is married and has two children and four grandchildren. All of them live with Carmen in the home she owns. To earn a living, she sells sweets such as cookies, chocolates and candies as well as cigarrettes in a small space that she created outside the house with a table to display her merchandise. She has been selling her goods from home in the afternoon for the last 10 years. In the mornings, she is a street vendor and sells fava beans, peanuts and other products. Her work keeps her active and she enjoys the activity and serving her customers. Carmen's business is profitable since there is a lot of foot traffic in her area which allows her to sell every day. This is her third loan with MFP and she is committed to paying the loan back on time. She tells us she enjoys working with her Village Bank as all of the members are very supportive and honest in their work. She will use the loan to build a kiosk and to buy more merchandise.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristina Howe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":461003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To construct a kiosk and to purchase more merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-30T17:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":304.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":309.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":330.32},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":338.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":352.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":364.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.65},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.61},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.42},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.32},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":106.65,"local_amount":304.7,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":307.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124423},{"amount":108.35,"local_amount":309.58,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:24Z","rounded_local_amount":312.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960164},{"amount":115.61,"local_amount":330.32,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":332.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993008},{"amount":118.42,"local_amount":338.34,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":341.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717794},{"amount":123.32,"local_amount":352.34,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":355.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751469},{"amount":127.65,"local_amount":364.72,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":367.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933926}],"funded_date":"2009-12-30T20:34:05Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":170213,"name":"Sokhom's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group loan consists of three people who are led by Mrs. Sokhom S..

business. She lives in Sitio. Tagasa, Brgy. Bitoon, Daanbantayan, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $210. Jessica is now borrowing 15,000 PHP to use as additional working capital. This will be her 5th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 13,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  \r\n\r\nJessica  aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
