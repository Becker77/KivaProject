Selain memberi makan dedak padi dan dedak gandum, juga diberi makanan tambahan seperi batang pisang dan juga dedaunan. Saman senang bila tiba saatnya pelanggan babi datang untuk membeli babinya. Karena  keuntungan yang diterima sangat membantu kebutuhan rumah tangganya. Dalam 6 bulan bisa meraup keuntungan Rp.1.000.000,- bersih. Keuntungan ini akan digunakan untuk membantu suaminya dalam memenuhi kebutuhan hidup setiap hari dan juga ditabung.

She used this money to invest in buying duck eggs, selling them at the local market and in bulk to restaurants.  The profit made daily was just enough to cover her family expenses.  The following years, she has been obtaining larger loans to increase the volume of her business.  In 2000, she was able to use the money she made to purchase a piece of land to build ducks houses for nesting and laying eggs.  Her inventory was enough to sell to the local market, eateries and restaurants.  After 10 plus years of borrowing along with smart investment, she has seen a success and growth with her business.  Presently, she has 2 egg warmers that produces 40.000 duck eggs a week, which she use to cater to eateries, restaurants and to the locals in her village.  This next loan, she is requesting 19.000.000 in which she plans to use for her business.

Her husband also works with them on their farm, cultivating potatoes; they have farmed for many years and it has gone very well for the family.  Every now and then, she also makes cheese and takes it to sell in the market.  A year ago, customers started to ask her for woolen yarn since she has plenty of wool from the animals on her farm.  Now she makes the yard while she takes their livestock out to pasture; she sells it for ~$4\/kilo depending on the thickness of the yarn.  She sells it to the artisans of San Pedro D. Cajas who make it into blankets and tapistries.  \r\n\r\nShe gets up at 5 am to make breakfast and lunch for her family; her husband takes his food to the farm.  Since she was young, she has spun yarn and she likes what she does.  It is a profitable business and she is happy doing it.  This is the fourth loan she has requested from MFP and she has been punctual in her payments.  The money will be used to purchase a yarn spinning machine so she can produce more.  The rest will be invested in fertilizer for their farmland.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva

Since she was 20 she has been studying all areas related to electrical installations, because she has family members who work in that area.  To join the family business she learned how to install alarms, and started doing that work three years ago.  She enjoys the work because it is not very complicated and most businesses want alarm installations for their protection, so it is a profitable business.  Pilar would like to have her own business in this line of work, so she is working, little by little, to build up her independence and do installations on her own.  This is her first loan with MFP.  Her entry into the group was very pleasant, bringing her happiness and confidence to be working as a team.

If fact, the demand for his products outweighs the supply he is able to provide.  Don Em\u00e9lido is thankful to the for the opportunities the microfinance organization has given him.  Little by little his family has been able to improve their quality of life.  They have been able to play an integral part in the development of the community, which has gone through frequent periods of inclemency and unemployment.\r\n\r\nDon Em\u00e9lido would like to obtain a loan for \u00a2685,000 (six hundred eighty-five thousand colones) so that he can purchase three cows to increase his production.  He knows that raising three extra cattle will require a lot of sacrifices and extra work.  However, his goal is to be an outstanding small business owner and he is motivated to get ahead and improve his family's quality of life.  \r\n\r\nDon Em\u00e9lido is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Datraban, one of 100 organizations which make up EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his second loan and with the loan he hopes to continue to grow on a personal and economic level and to become more active in the credit organization in his community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matthew Raimondi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":370288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase three cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":127,"posted_date":"2009-08-16T20:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Em\u00e9lido ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":685000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":171250},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":171250},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":171250},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":171250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":0.04,"local_amount":22.95,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":23.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669348},{"amount":293.71,"local_amount":171226.2,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":171996.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899904},{"amount":881.25,"local_amount":513750,"processed_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":516059.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152035472}],"funded_date":"2009-08-20T21:00:26Z","paid_date":"2010-07-16T07:37:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Raimondi","image":549898}},{"id":133486,"name":"Yarleny Concepcion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

While it is not the only means by which revenue is generated, the business' main source of income is from the planting and harvesting of bananas for sale. Celerina has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Celerina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services in order to help improve her living conditions and ability to engage in business activities. Celerina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This earlier loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Celerina is now requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP that will be used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Celerina from GDMPC.

He lives with his family. He has owned a perfume and pocketbook shop in his town since 2003. His shop is well known because he always tries to offer the new brands to his local customers.  In almost all parts of Lebanon, demand for beauty and fashion products continues to be high.  His brother is out of Lebanon so he is the one who is helping his father with the household expenses.

She is the wife of her husband Wilfredo, and mother to their children. She and her husband manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJosie operates a foam\/pillow manufacturing business. Her products are foam for beds and pillows. They assemble foam and pillows out of materials she buys from the factory. They prepare the bed and pillowcases and assemble them with the foam materials. She sells her products directly to the market and the local community. She earns a minimum of 5000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 16,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials. She expects a boost in income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nJosie hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business.

He is single, has no children, and lives alone in his own house, but he still undertakes to contribute to his parents' household expenses. He always keeps an eye on his parents so that he can offer them anything they need.\r\n\r\nJuan's work consists of selling drinks, which he buys in bulk, and oftn sells alongside related products such as ice-cream and sorbets. He has been doing this work for a year. When he began, he found he had a lot of competition, but as time has gone on people began to prefer his products, because the products are always well chilled and served with a smile. He works alone, which is esential to maintaining his income. What he likes about his work is that it gives him time to do other things: he also works in a bank in the city, which gives him greater financial stability.

He has owned his lands for about 4 years, deciding to move away from his family's plot shortly after having his first child. Although his farm is small, it provides enough rice to support the household. He learned rice farming from his father, who has been farming for his entire life as well. He and his wife Andrea have two children, one who is 5 and the other who is 2. They are optimistic about the loan and are hoping their lands continue to be productive.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Paypayales Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Roberto is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Paypayales Communal Bank. All bank members are part of a rice farmers' cooperative in Santa Lucia named Dios Con Nosotros (God is with us). They will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all the guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Dios con Nosotros Cooperative are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

She travels to different towns and villages to sell new clothes. She is married and the mother of five children. Digna is assisted by her husband, a farmer and cattle rancher.

They have 2 children, who are both living at home. Nuria and her husband are farmers. They cultivate citrus fruit on their family's plots and they harvest the fruit between January and March. Because their farming does not bring in any money the rest of the year, Nuria's husband also works as a builder and she dedicates herself to a variety of activities. For example, she sells clothes with her sister every other weekend (see photo). Once, while she and her sister were selling clothes, they met people who farmed silk and who had been raising their own silkworms for a year. Listening to these people carefully, Nuria realized that the idea of becoming a silk farmer really appealed to her. She also thinks it will be quite profitable and would love to become a successful businesswoman in this trade. It would be wonderful to have another steady income, and not to have to wait so anxiously for the citrus harvest each year. Nuria also hopes to become a very active member of her communal bank and thus grow as a person. This is her first loan from MFP, and she is committed to making her repayments punctually.

They live in the village of Bulubitoon, Brgy. Miranda, Hinigaran, in Negros Occidental with their three children, who range in age from six to twelve years-old. Jeremy's mission in life is to help her husband raise their three children well, and provide them with a good future through education. In the short term, she plans to earn enough income to defray their small family's household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nHer aspirations for her family became more attainable when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access the microcredit loans it offers using the Grameen methodology. She used the first loan as capital to set up her own general store. She was very happy when she saw that even with just a small amount of capital and its small returns, she was able to help provide for her family and set aside some savings for future security. She was able to increase her next loan amount by paying back each weekly installment on time, and paying off the loan within the set term. As a result, she was able to expand her business and started a food vending business. She knows that she is well on her way to attaining her dreams, as each new loan has also increased her monthly income. At present, she earns an average income of PHP 8,000 per month from her business activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn her previous ninth loan cycle, she borrowed PHP 16,000, which she used as additional capital in her business. She maintained her good track record by paying each installment on time, and paying back the full amount within the set loan term. Jeremy plans to borrow PHP 17,000 for her tenth loan cycle to buy stocks for her business, such as the very in-demand firecrackers and fireworks, in preparation for the coming holiday season.\r\n<p>\r\nJeremy is shown in the attached picture with her 2 sons.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":395990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She operates a business which is the buying and selling of junk items. Her average gross sales is about 2,000 pesos per day which can really help with their daily expenditures.\n\nEufracia sells her junk items daily. She is requesting a loan of 5,750 pesos so she can buy more junk items which she will then sell again. She is quite happy in her business and has it expand as people become more aware of recycling. \n  \nEufracia is already on her 8th loan and her previous loan was 5,500 pesos.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For this reason, Mahmadsaid is requesting your help with a loan of $1000 to increase his production with the purchase of additional seeds and fertilizer.   \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a cheerful and responsible woman and a single mother of 2 beautiful children:  Jeyson,  8 and Jeniffer,   3 months old. They live in their own house located in the Peruvian jungle (a native community called Centro Pumpuriani). For 2 years she has planted different products, such as plantains, yucca, and hybrid corn. This brings her earnings at different times of the year. For example, she harvests the corn 6 months after planting, the yucca after the corn, and the plantains every two weeks. This helps her invest more. When her crops are ready, she sells them to buyers who come on weekends to the native community. What Lida likes the most is being able to plant different varieties of products, in addition to spending her free time planting and clearing on other land, where they pay her extra money according to how long she works there. Now she plans to plant citrus, since these crops are grown for 8 years before they begin producing- enough time to be able to generate more income in the future. Meanwhile, she is taking advantage of the coffee harvest these months, when she for sure will be able to make some income. She belongs to the \u201cAbejitas de Pumpuriani\u201d [Little Bees of Pumpuriani] community bank, and this is her third loan with MFP. She hopes to have their cooperation to achieve her goals. She is also committed once again to making her payments, as with the previous loans she had. In addition, she likes being a part of her community bank because all of its members are responsible and supportive people.

2003, Tatyana has had a small business selling women\u2019s lingerie. She is divorced and has one son. The business is the main source of income for her and her son. Tatyana acknowledges that through her experience she has learned a tremendous amount about every aspect of business. \r\n\r\nHer resolution and determination in her work have helped her learn flexibility and develop qualities like patience, perseverance and customer-friendliness. Tatyana\u2019s ability to learn her customer\u2019s preferences and tastes has helped her be more effective in her trade and achieve sales success.   \r\n\r\nTatyana is requesting a loan of $1,000 to purchase a vending facility and begin construction of a kiosk. She is also planning to use some money to re-stock her inventory so she can increase her sales. We believe that her hard work and common sense in combination with financial assistance will help Tatyana achieve her goals and expand her business as a result.

Buliwao, Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya. She is the group leader of a 14-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nOfelia is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Ofelia has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Ofelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Ofelia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the products offered. This will be the eighth loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

San Antonio, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  General Store and Cane Planter (Arendo) businesses. Her husband Eriberto Miguil Jr., who is 33 years old, works as a Tricycle (three-wheeled transport vehicle) Driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 3 and  9 years old. \r\n\r\nAilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ailyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 24,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 26,000, which she intends to use to pay for inventory for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nAilyn M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

To make a living, Elsa owns & operates a direct selling business.

Elsa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elsa is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Elsa from ASKI.

The official name of this borrowing group is Virginia D. G.'s group.\r\n\r\nVirginia is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Virginia raises pigs for fattening and sale.

Virginia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. \r\n\r\nVirginia is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.

Arnold believes, like most poor Filipino parents, that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children, as he himself has been an undergraduate.\n\nArnold operates a variety store, which, in the Philippines, is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil or an egg. Arnold earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house and his regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 800 in daily sales.\n\nTo help him continue operations of his business, Arnold is requesting a PHP8,000 loan. He will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \n\nArnold hopes to be able to expand soon, just as he fervently hopes that his children will be able to graduate one day and finish their studies. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is also a cheerful and supportive individual.  Cori is in a happy common-law relationship with Juiber and they have three beautiful children (ages 20, 18, and 14).  They live comfortably in their own home.  Cori sells food such as noodles, fried chicken, \u201cjuanes\u201d (chicken and rice wrapped in banana leaves), fried rice, and other dishes.  She has a table set up in front of her house where she has been selling in the evenings every day of the week for the past 14 years.  Cori provides friendly service to her customers, most of whom are neighbors and friends.  They come to buy everything she prepares.  Her sister helps with preparing food and attending to the customers.  She is paid every day she works.  Cori enjoys her business because it provides a distraction and keeps her busy.  In addition, she likes to cook because she learned this skill for her mother.  She has accumulated regular customers and earns a good income.  On the other hand, she dislikes operating her business when it rains because she generates few sales.  This does not discourage her and she has plans to expand and improve her business.  She wants to open a restaurant in her home.\r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with the MFP organization.  She hopes that this small loan will enable her to complete her goals.  In addition, Cori promises to be punctual with her payments just like she did with her previous loans.  She has a good credit record.  Cori is comfortable with her group because she considers the members to be good people.  The amount of 1000 PEN that she is requesting will be used to buy a new stove, utensils, plates, and cups.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":930373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a new stove, utensils, plates, and cups.

She is 52 years old. Teresita is married and has two adult children. Teresita operates a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Teresita has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 2,800 Philippine pesos (about $58) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Teresita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 10th loan taken out by Teresita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 57 years old and the mother of three grown children. She concentrates on selling food in the mornings which she does from her home each day of the week, counting on the support of her husband who is a car driver. Rosa has been a member of the \"Mujeres Valientes\" Communal Bank for four years. The first loan she received allowed her to invest in balanced feed for chickens, which she used to sell in the market. Currently she needs a loan of 1300 soles that will let her invest in the purchase of tables, chairs, tablecloths and utensils for her food business. Rosa's goal is to own a restaurant and move ahead in her work. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by David Kaisel, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":409358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables, chairs, tablecloths and utensils for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2010-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":325,"processed_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":341.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835764},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":325,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":341.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727529},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":325,"processed_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:27Z","rounded_local_amount":341.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118117899},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":325,"processed_date":"2010-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":341.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953631}],"funded_date":"2009-11-02T21:49:35Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Megan and David Kaisel","image":256530}},{"id":150013,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is 40 years old and married with five children.

In a village people at least possess a piece of land and may have some cattle to breed and can grow different kinds of vegetables and fruits in their gardens. For city residents the situation is somehow more specific. First of all, people depend on employers and markets. Especially in Kyrgyzstan, where cities used to be centers of industry, they now resemble villages because the living standards have worsened. \r\n\r\nHowever, even in that situation there are many people who, unlike their compatriots, find energy, ideas and inspiration to look for a better life and opportunities. P. Mambetalieva is the leader of this group. She is twenty-three, married, and has a four-year-old son. Her husband trades in spare parts for cars in a specialized market.\r\n\r\nP. does her best to help her husband support the family, selling women\u2019s clothes at retail prices. She has been doing this for the last two years and now her monthly income is around $200. P. has many plans regarding her occupation. She decided to apply for this loan because it would help her purchase new items of clothing (summer and fall) and thus expand her assortment. \r\n\r\nP.\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nN. Jyrnova, 42, is married and, together with her husband, they keep a household and raise cattle. Apart from trading in cattle they also sell milk and manage to earn about $190 a month. She hopes to obtain this loan to buy a calf for feeding.\r\n\r\nT. Abduldayev, 24, is married and has a four-month-old daughter. His wife stays at home with the child. To provide for the family, T. manufactures furniture. He used to work in a factory but now has his own business. T. needs this loan to buy materials for making furniture. \r\n\r\nZ. Abduldayeva, 27, is married and has a son. Her husband is a welder. Z. cannot work now and stays at home with the child. Her husband\u2019s monthly income is around $205. She has applied for this loan to buy a calf for feeding and thus help her husband financially. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

In the future, Kalpana plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory stocked and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to its clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

He makes and sells \u201cpeto\u201d , a delicious drink, or warm  \u201cchicha\u201d  (a drink derived from corn).  It is prepared with husked corn, sugar, a pinch of salt and cinnamon.\r\n\r\nHe started this activity in order to change from his old business of making handmade coastal sausages called \u201cbutifarra\u201d.  Previously he only worked on this on the week-ends.  But, as Jorge Eliecer is a very hard-working and responsible family man, he decided to add another business activity that would generate income every day.  That is how he got to know the job of selling peto, a business in which his father works.  He decided to fill in for him in order to have greater earnings.  \r\n\r\nAs his family grows, the household necessities increase.  His home is made up of his wife and their two children, ages 9 and 15.\r\n\r\nSince he started with his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domino, he has seen positive changes in his business.  This is especially true because it is new working capital that he invests.  It generates other benefits, leaving the imprint of the strength of his work.\r\n\r\nThe Kiva loan is his second loan.  He will use it to change the \u201ctriciclo\u201d (vehicle with three wheels) and the aluminum tanks.  Doing so will improve the condition of his infrastructure.  He will also buy supplies to make his product.\r\n\r\nHis main dream is to have his own house in order to increase his family\u2019s well-being.  Therefore, he will work arduously because his family is his inspiration for doing so.  His business currently generates a profit margin of 22% and will carry a very low future debt ratio.  With his capacity for work and his entrepreneurial experience, this new investment will be successful because it will impact his income. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":712724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"He will change his tricycle and the aluminum tanks, which will improve the condition of his infrastructure for his new business.

Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business. \n\nBeing an older woman and accessing capital in Kitale is very challenging, but Florence feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising women like her.

When her children are not in school, they also help her at the store.<p> \r\n\r\nDelfina started her business two years ago. Before starting her grocery store, she had a business where she sold meat. But due to high rental and transport costs, Delfina decided to open a grocery store located closer to her house. She works everyday from 6 am until 8 pm, closing later in the summer. Delfina is requesting a $200 loan to restock her inventory, particularly the items in highest demand: wine, milk, and bread. <p> \r\n\r\nIn addition to her grocery store, Delfina also lends out money.

She is 30 years old, married and has two children. She has secondary education. She is in the retail business and has own vendor space at the local market where she sells polyethylene. She brings in the products from Dushanbe (capital of Tajikistan) where she buys it from wholesalers at a lower price and then resells it for a more profitable price. This business is the main source of income for her family and it's important for Mahbuba to develop and expand it. Her merchandise is in high demand among the local residents. Polyethylene is used in farming and agriculture, such as in greenhouses, and that's why the development of the retail sector for this products allows to supply the markets with it. Mahbuba has been in this business for the past three years. She plans to use the loan to increase her commodity turnover and plans to pay off the loan within 12 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

She lives there with her husband and her daughter, Leydi, 5.  She wants a better future for herself and her family and she's working hard to get it.  Graciela works as a street vendor, going out every day to sell home-made \"chuspitas\" (a knitted or woven bag or purse).  She sells them in the \"distrito\" of Ilave, an hour from the city of Puno.  She's operated the business for 10 years and it's given her a lot of satisfaction.  She knits like she was born to do it and she enjoys her work.  She practically spends every hour of the day knitting, so much that it's become difficult for her to carry all her merchandise from Puno to Ilave.  She makes the sacrifice, though, because there's not much competition there and she can sell more.  Graciela is happy to work hard because it will allow her to give her darling daughter a good education.  Graciela knows what it's like to not have everyday necessities and she wants to make sure her daughter has the things she needs.

Graciela wants to buy more wool to make her crafts.  That will cost around 300 new soles.

Her eldest child is still studying in college and her youngest is a computer programming undergraduate who works as a computer programmer and a sales boy in a private computer shop in town. Her husband has been her partner for life in the business. Rodolfo is the one that managed the business and Rita manages their finances.\r\n<p>\r\nRita joined ASHI in 1999 because she wished to have her own business. Through ASHI she was able to acquire capital to start up a business which she and her husband chose. Rita\u2019s husband is skilled and well experienced in repairing and vulcanizing vehicle tires, therefore Rita thought that doing this kind of business would not require any more training. As years went on, Rita\u2019s loan in ASHI grew from Php5,000 to Php30,000 in her most recent loan. She expanded her business as well, however, it is not as big as she expects and is not earning as much as she imagined due to frequent electric power interruptions. There were times when the interruption lasted for several weeks, especially when there is a typhoon.\r\n<p>\r\nRita knew that only if they have their own electric generator, can their business continue its operation even if the whole town suffers from electric power interruption. Hence, Rita applied for a loan from ASHI. After using the generator and seeing improvements in her business income generation, Rita will borrow a bigger amount to improve their vulcanizing shop and purchase more necessary machines for the business. Rita also wants to have more supplies of vehicle tires to sell to her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nAside from Rita\u2019s business managed by her husband, she is also into a buy and sell business. This is how she makes her weekly payments for her loan from ASHI. Rita is so much happy to have her own business to run and a business that her family is having. She hopes that her vulcanizing shop will grow further and will be successful for this has been her family\u2019s cup of tea and bread for long time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":350482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle

Since she formed her family she initiated her farming activities.  Since that day, she supports her husband with hard work in the farming of potatoes, lettuces and corn on rented farm land.  Of all their products, the most profitable is the potatoes because they can be sold both as seed and as a consumable to the local town's crop gathering center thereby avoiding the hassle of having to transport their loads.\r\nIn the corn's case, since it doesn't always command a good price, when the price is low she lets it dry on the cob and sells it that way, thereby not losing her investment.  Marcelina enjoys her work but lacks the capital to have plantings like she would prefer.\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she pledges to repay on time so that she can count on future loans.  The funds she is requesting now sill be used to buy chemical fertilizers for her next potato crop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":410204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-20T19:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":503.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959727},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":503.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717363}],"funded_date":"2009-10-20T20:47:37Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":150029,"name":"Alejandrina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alejandrina, a client of Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa, is part of a communal bank called Virgen Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n - Anta, consisting of 19 members.

She is married, the mother of a 14-year-old, who also supports five other people. She has been a member of the U-IMCEC bank since February 2004 and has already received a loan. Mrs. S. has been developing an ice cream and breakfast business for ten years. She has a stall facing the Yoff bank. She chose this business because she has always wanted to live without depending on others. Thus with her profits she would be able to take care of her own personal needs. What interests her most about this business is interacting with her customers whom she enjoys, but also making a profit. She is seeking a loan of 50,000frs and looking to build up her working operating in order to buy several products for the breakfasts she sells.

Rukia is 44 years old, married and has three children ages 10, 15 and 22 years old.  All of her children go to school.\r\n\r\nFor 16 years, Rukia has been running a clothing business.  She started out selling used clothes, but has grown her business and now she sells madila, which are long embroidered robes often worn by Muslim women in Tanzania.  Rukia works from 9 am until 6 pm each day and earns a profit of about 400,000 Tanzanian shillings ($270) per month.\r\n\r\nShe used her first loan from Tujijenge to increase her stock of madila and will use this loan to buy garments from Mombassa (Kenya) and India.

She is married and has 3 children aged 20, 18 and 13.  In 2007, she established  her vegetable farming business.  Working 7 days a week and 5 hours a day, she supports her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to purchase seed and fertilizer for her business.  In the future, Jayanti plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seed and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

There he began his family together with Ida, his wife of two years. They have four children that they constantly care for and educate. Every morning for 8 years he heads to his farmland where he plants plantains and coffee. \n\nAccording to his story: before, he didn't have the money he needed to buy more farmland; with time and hard work his was able to obtain 5 hectares of arable land. He now plants 3 hectares of plantains and 2 hectares of coffee. The plantain is more in demand and provides earnings every 15 days, which is its cycle of maturation. During the coffee harvest once a year, he makes good money because one hectare of land produces at least 60 sacks of coffee. \"Every kilo costs 12 soles\", comments Paul, \"I'm sure it will go up even more.\" \n\nNow is the time to harvest coffee and he's very happy with the results that he's getting. Because of this he's thinking about investing in planting more coffee so that in the future he can make more money. \n\nHe belongs to the village bank \"Abjitas de Pumpuriani\" and this is his first loan with MFP. He hopes that this collaboration will help him achieve his goals. He promises to make his payments. He is grateful to be part of his village bank because all of the members are responsible and unified.\n\nOnce he receives the loan he will invest in the purchase of some sacks of organic compost to spread among his coffee crop and a little for the plantains, because he feels it's very important that they produce more fruit. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":790013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy sacks of organic compost.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-14T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":759.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666214}],"funded_date":"2011-06-15T11:34:23Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":310566,"name":"Analiza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Analiza is 37 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Marah wants to help her husband by purchasing bulk vegetables for sale to increase his collection and increase his income, but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay, so she needs to take a loan of $1,500 from FATEN. When Marah gets the loan, she will be able to help her husband and purchase bulk vegetables, so he will be able to compete with others and improve his sales and increase his income.

Before, she worked for a government agency, but due to increasing needs of her family she had to leave her job and start her own business. She bought several sewing machines, involved her daughter and daughter-in-law, and began a production. Three of them sew traditional Tajik blankets - \"kurpachi\". Several of her clients purchase kurpachi and them resell them at different markets. A few months ago, Ozoda took several neighboring girls as trainees and began teaching them how to sew. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Ozodahon has an good sized outstanding order.

Elijah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elijah S. is married and has one child. He lives in Belo, Cameroon and sets up shop in the Belo Market. Elijah buys and sells goods at his general store. With this loan he plans to purchase one bag of rice, two cartons of soap, a half carton of dry fish, three bags of Maggi (a popular seasoning in Cameroon), one roll of sugar and two buckets of Gari.\r\n<p>\r\nElijah believes his business will succeed because he sells the basic necessities that people need. He also works hard and is good to his customers. Financially, Elijah sells his products at moderate prices and thinks ahead by saving some of his money in a credit union.\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough Elijah has had some obstacles, such as fire destroying his plantain farm and learning how to run a good business, he is still trying. With the profits from this loan, Elijah looks forward to paying his child's school fees, saving some of it with GHAPE, buying plantain to plant in his farm, increasing his business and contributing to his Njangi group.\r\n<p>\r\nNjangi groups in Cameroon are an informal way to lend money. Each month a different member collects the group's dues and may use it for whatever they please. It is very prevalent, as you can see groups dressed in their distinct uniforms around town, near the time they meet.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Elijah's second loan from GHAPE since he became a member in early 2008. Elijah takes out GHAPE loans because \"of their truthfulness\" and the way in which everything is documented.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":329322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy rice, soap, dry fish, maggi (a seasoning), sugar, and gari to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Nganti, Belo, N.W.
