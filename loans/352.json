Nurhayati and her husband, Amad, buy waste material like plastic cups, plastic bottles, cardboard, and paper from her neighbors and other houses in the village. Her husband uses a cart to collect scrap metal and other waste material. Households do not just give away waste material, because there is demand and therefore economic value in recycling. So the more working capital they have, the more scrap they can collect and recycle. Their own working capital is limited. Having heard from her friends about MBK, Nurhayati has now applied to MBK to add to her working capital. Since this is the first time Nurhayati can only borrow a maximum of $500 from MBK.

She can sell about 60kg daily, so she nets $3 daily profit.  Demand for red sugar increases around Hindu festivals, so she earns more during those days.

Dalam sehari Ni Ketut R. dapat memperoleh dagangan paling sedikit sebanyak 60 kg. Jadi keuntungan bersih yang didapat dapat sehari mencapai Rp.30.000,- Permintaan gula merah meningkat apabila sudah mendekati hari raya-hari raya umat Hindhu, sehingga keuntungan lebih meningkat lagi.

This is 38-year-old Maria M. from Mbeya. She is married with three children, between the ages of 9 and 13. Maria has been running a \"kuku\" business since 2004.  Raising \"kuku\" is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. In fact, if you are a regular lender on Kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about \"kuku\". <P>\r\n\r\nWho or what are \"kuku\", you may ask. \"Kuku\" means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons.  Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising \"kuku\" is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow.<P>\r\n\r\nMaria works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week, and is assisted by her husband. Maria currently earns about 70 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 450 USD in order to purchase more chickens (\"kuku\") for re-selling. In the future, she plans to open another business. Maria thanks you for your support!<P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":256106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more chickens (kuku) for re-selling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T20:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria E.

The children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nJeanna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her general store and rice-retailing business. Now she earns an average monthly income of $335 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of 26,000 PHP was used to fund the operations of her general store and rice-retailing business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 13th cycle loan the amount of 28,000 PHP, which she intends to use on her general store and rice-retailing business. Jeanna is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Binangonan, Rizal province, in the Philippines. She is a mother to four. Her husband, Teodoro, is 65 and her partner in business.\r\n\r\nBefore, she sold charcoal and made baskets but the business was so tedious and consumed so much time, she opted to shift her business into fishing. For her 11th loan, she proposes to borrow 40,000 pesos to purchase a motorboat for fishing. This will be their new business. \r\n\r\nShe is hopeful that the business will grow and be sustainable since fishing is one of the staple sources of income in the island village and having a motorboat is an edge over other fishermen.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of helping her grandson with his school fees, expanding her business and building a more spacious and durable house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":349610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She is married and lives with her youngest child, who is 23, in a leased house. For more than three years, she has been selling different items, depending on the occasion and time of year, but she prefers to sell baby clothing. Liliana goes on long hikes to find new customers, so she leaves her house every morning and comes back in the afternoon. In this way she has been able to earn her own income that allows her to cover her household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nLiliana is happy to be doing this, because it allows her to communicate with the other people in her area, and in the near future she would like to continue selling but in an established store in her own area.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the first time that she has had a loan with MFP. She joined her communal bank because of an invitation from one of the members, so she is committed to being punctual with her payments. The money that she is requesting will be used to buy a larger quantity of clothing for all ages. She will travel to another city to stock up on large quantities.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Iverson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":369835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-16T02:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":128.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641710},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":128.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081158},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:01Z","rounded_local_amount":128.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997309},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:52Z","rounded_local_amount":128.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842653},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:41Z","rounded_local_amount":512.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734235}],"funded_date":"2009-08-22T16:27:27Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Iverson","image":411368}},{"id":133193,"name":"Margret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margret is a 41-year-old married woman with six children, aged between 22 and 9 years.

Burulush\u2019s husband is engaged in farming.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, after the breakdown of the Soviet Union, Burulush lost her job. That is why in 1995, Burulush began to engage in stock-breeding using the 20,000 Kyrgyzstan soms (KGS) that she had put aside for a rainy day. At that time, she had only two calves. Gaining experience in cattle breeding, Burulush broadened her business and today owns 24 sheep, one milk cow, one calf and one horse. She also began to cultivate a plot of land with potatoes, kidney beans and perennial herbs.  \r\n\r\nBurulush is a really hard-working woman.

Since her husband could not work anymore she started travelling to the market in Trujillo to sell the produce from their plot of land.   In Trujillo she saw the opportunity to purchase 200 chicks to raise back home to increase the family income.  A niece suggested she join the Communal Bank \u201cLas Lomas II\u201d to help her obtain a $100 loan to purchase chicken feed.  Three months later she sold all the chickens. <p>\r\n\r\nMrs. Maria dedided this was a profitable business venture and moved to Trujillo to dedicate herself fulltime to raising chickens.  However, she must travel to Monchacap weekly to help a family member with a plot of land.  She brings back to the Trujillo market the harvests and brings chickens and clothing back to her home town to sell.\r\nCurrently she has 400 chicks and 50 chickens ready to sell.  The $567 loan she received from Manuela Ramos will be payed back in four installments.  The money will be used to purchase chicken feed which will get them ready to sell in time for the New Year\u00b4s Eve family celebrations.<p>\r\n\r\nMrs. Maria dreams of having a larger plot of land which will allow her to increase the production of chicks.

She owns and operates a clothing and cosmetics shop in the local market of Obuasi where she lives.

The profits from this loan will go towards paying his child\u2019s school fees as well as supporting other members of his family.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. \r\n\r\nThis leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":319811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-15T18:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edina Katyega","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":503062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773292}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T01:42:58Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":112695,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julia C. is from the town of Pana-on, Misamis Occidental.

Florita is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP to be used to purchase additional products to sell to expand the product offering. This will be the second loan taken out by Florita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Fiaola has many years of experience in this business.  Fiaola needs a loan of WST $2500 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nFiaola iss requesting an additional loan to expand her business as an ongoing activity to improve her family and support her children in terms of school fees.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Fiaola's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nYou can view Fiaola's previous loan on Kiva at:  http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=93494\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fiaola are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:               1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

Be an important of the growth of Sairanbibi\u2019s business. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He is 40 years old, married, and is the father of a five-year-old son who does not yet attend school. Sumail only studied through 7th grade and didn't continue because of a lack of financial resources. He lives in his own home with his family and isn't responsible for supporting anyone else financially.\r\n\r\nSumail left Cabo Delgado for the district of Boane in search of better living conditions. He has had his own business for more than 4 years and has no other employees, though he is helped by his wife. He sells wooden beds and nightstands, and his monthly earnings come to around 7000.00 Meticales. He uses this income to cover household expenses and also saves some money each month in his bank account (with Millenium Bim). \r\n\r\nSumail has never taken out a loan with another bank. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through neighbors who were already working with the institution. This is his 3rd loan, for the amount of 20,000.00 Meticales. He plans to use this money to buy products (wooden beds, nightstands and other items) in order to increase his merchandise. His earlier loans were for 6000.00 Meticales and 11,500.00 Meticales, and both were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future he would like to apply for more loans to begin selling mattresses in his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

With this business she has managed to have a profitable economic activity that helps her to improve her quality of life and support her grandmother, who has been her mother and father all of her life.\r\n\r\nCurrently she needs a loan of 654,000 Costa Rican colones to buy materials needed to expand her store, so that she can provide better service to her customers.  She comments that the service that she provides is very important, since she has a lot of customers and so needs more space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar,

She earns her living by operating a business of buying, weaving and selling nipa (a palm whose foliage is used for thatching). Her husband, Bennymar, who is 30 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are between 4 and 8 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Gilda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 6,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $75, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 3rd loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Ma.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Before her husband passed away, Miatin had been selling meatball-noodle in a mobile food stall. After his husband passed away, no one could hep her to carry her food stall around. Miatin switched to a stationary food stall near the harbor. She opens her stall from 8AM to 9PM.\r\n\r\nWith initial capital of 300,000 IDR (1USD~9,000 IDR), Miatin can earn a profit of 40,000 IDR daily. She used the profit to pay for her basic needs, for additional working capital and for paying the rent for her food stall of 150,000 IDR per month. With the loan from Dinari, Miatin plans to add more variety to her food stall so she can earn bigger profir and serves more customers.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nSebagai seorang janda, Miatin harus berusaha untuk menghidupi dirinya sendiri karena semua anaknya sudah menikah dan tinggal bersama pasangannya masing \u2013 masing. Sebelum suaminya meninggal, Miatin berjualan bakso dengan cara keliling di lingkungannya. Namun, setelah suaminya meninggal, tidak ada lagi yang bisa mendorong rombong yang dipakainya berjualan. Karena hal itu, Miatin beralih usaha dengan membuka usaha warung nasi di dekat pelabuhan. Miatin membuka usahanya dari pukul 8 pagi sampai pukul 9 malam.\r\n\tDengan modal awal sebesar Rp. 300.000.-, Miatin bisa mendapat keuntungan Rp. 40.000.- per hari. Dengan keuntungan itu Miatin sisihkan untuk keperluan sehari \u2013 hari, menambah modal dan juga untuk membayar sewa tempat usaha sebesar Rp. 150.000.- per bulan. Dengan pinjaman dari Dinari, Miatin berencana untuk menambah jenis dagangannya sehingga ia bisa mendapat keuntungan yang lebih besar dan melayani lebih banyak

She is married with one child. At the moment, her son is in senior high school. She has been a local manufacturer of palm oil and also has been selling grocery products and fruit like bananas for the past twenty years in order to take care of her family. Palm oil is produced from palm fruits. The palm fruit is processed through various stages to obtain the palm oil.  The palm oil produced is used to prepare many local dishes. Her production is on a small scale due to lacking the necessary capital to buy machines for the work of processing.<P>\r\n\r\nIn addition to her palm oil business, she also operates a grocery shop and sells item like sugar, biscuits, evaporated milk, etc., and bananas in the community where she lives. She says this has also slowed down due to current food prices and the economic crunch in the world market. She wants to use the loan to buy more palm nuts to increase her capacity to produce in larger quantities. She plans to purchase rice, sugar, milk, biscuits, and other canned foods, etc. so that she can supply her customers on a regular basis.<P>\r\n\r\nAbena believes this will help expand her business to raise more income to help her husband provide food and finance her dear child's education. Abena belongs to a village bank called \u2018Nyame Nti\u2019 which means For Christ's Sake. She hopes to receive GHS 1000 to make business progress by restocking her inventory.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":269134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Faizullo is 54 years old, married, and lives with his wife and adult son. He works very hard at cultivating wheat, an activity which he has practiced for five years. He enjoys his work for the contact with nature, and also because wheat sells very well in the markets and is valued within his community. Currently Faizullo needs a loan of $675 for his business. With this loan, he will buy seed and fertilizers to improve his farm and get a larger crop. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 39 years old and has three children, all of whom are in school. Her husband is an accountant by trade, but he is currently unemployed, so her small grocery store is their family's only source of income. Her business is currently understocked, however, so this loan will allow her to invest in the purchase of rice, beans, sugar, oil, soap, dairy products, chicken, candy and soda. She will then be able to sell more merchandise and earn more in profits so that she can sustain her family and support her husband while he finds another job. She has to support her three children so that they can get a good education. She is thankful to Afodenic for supporting many Nicaraguan families like hers through the current economic\/unemployment crisis as well as through other past and future crises. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":448630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy rice, beans, sugar, oil, soap, dairy products, chicken, candy and soda in order to offer a wider variety of merchandise and sell more items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-15T01:30:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivania Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":699.97,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":727.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003435},{"amount":22.94,"local_amount":458.88,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":476.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874422},{"amount":26.81,"local_amount":536.29,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":557.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604301},{"amount":26.36,"local_amount":527.1,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":547.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639765},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T08:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":577.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821550},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":577.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561557},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":577.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770494},{"amount":27.77,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":577.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204389},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":555.52,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":577.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330113}],"funded_date":"2009-12-15T15:20:03Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T12:01:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":166243,"name":"Lizbeth Rocio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lisbeth Rocio H.

T. was born in the district of Boane, Maputo Province, in southern Mozambique. She is 42 years old, and a widow and mother of two children, 23 and 17 years of age. Both children attend school. She only went through the 7th grade, and wasn't able to continue because of her family's difficult financial circumstances. She lives in her own home with her sons, and also supports her mother by sending her money and food.\r\nShe left Boane for the city of Matola after she got married. She's owned her own business for more than 18 years. She works on her own, sometimes with her daughters' help, and sells wooden beds, tables, and bookshelves. She earns 12,000 meticals per month, which she uses to cover household expenses, and is even able to save some in her bank account.\r\nShe's never received loans from other banks. She learned about Hvuluku through her customers who are alsoHvuluku clients. This is her second loan, in the value of 16,000 meticals, which she intends to use to purchase materials (wooden trunks, beds, tables, bookshelves, etc.) to increase her stock. She also used the previous loan of 10,000 meticals for this purpose.\r\nShe's committed to paying this loan off on time so that in the future she'll be eligible for others. She'd like to request other loans to finish off her residence and build a structure from which to run her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":502528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase furniture to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-03-10T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cec\u00edlia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":706.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":738.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":772.05},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":806.95},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":843.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":881.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":921.41},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":963.06},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1006.6},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1052.1},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1099.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1149.37},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1201.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1255.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.4},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1289.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.08},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.09},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.36},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.79},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.1},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.91},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.02},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":65.43,"local_amount":2093.82,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-16T08:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2106.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128972154},{"amount":3.86,"local_amount":123.6,"processed_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":124.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144732368},{"amount":430.71,"local_amount":13782.58,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-01T07:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":13865.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916187}],"funded_date":"2010-03-10T13:46:24Z","paid_date":"2010-09-01T07:59:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":187313,"name":"Silvia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Silvia es soltera, se dedica a la venta de abarrotes desde hace cinco a\u00f1os, ella vive sola en el barrio Cupesi ya que ahi se encuentra  su tienda donde vende  todos los productos de primera necesidad es una tienda muy surtida ya que tiene lo necesario pero ella necesita ampliar su negocio y con el dinero del credito la Sra.

She is forty-three and married. She has four children: her sons are nineteen and fifteen, her daughters are eighteen and twelve. All her children go to school. Her husband is a construction worker. In addition to doing construction work, her husband also breeds cattle. Gulbaira is a worker at the local hospital. \r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, she spent 7,000 soms on the purchase of cattle for breeding. Since that time, she has significantly increased the size of her herd and makes 8,000 soms each month on cattle breeding. With the profits from cattle breeding, she will be able to pay tuition fees for their children at institutions of higher education. She is planning to save some money to pay for the higher education of her youngest children. To do this, she plans to help her husband increase number of cattle in order to increase her profits from cattle breeding. Therefore, she applies for a loan. She is planning to purchase additional cattle on the loan received. \r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\n- Nurzhamilia Z. is treasurer of the group. She is forty-eight and a widow. She has two daughters and a son. Her daughters are eleven and five years old. Her elder daughter goes to school and her younger daughter goes to kindergarten \u201cKelechek\u201d. She sells convenience goods at her small shop. Three years ago, her friend suggested she start selling convenience goods because she already had a free place for a shop. So she started selling convenience goods with an initial investment of 60,000 soms. Now, she makes 20 000 soms by selling convenience goods. On the profits from her business, she was able to send her son to an Islamic institution in Pakistan. She is applying for a loan in order to purchase goods and increase her turnover. On the profits from her business, she is planning to expand her business and marry her elder son. \r\n\r\n- Sharshenaly A. is forty one and married. He has three sons. They are fifteen, thirteen and nine years old. All of them go to school. He is hairdresser. He has his own hairdressing salon. In 2000, he finished hairdresser courses and negotiated the rent of a room where he started providing hairdresser services. He has worked for ten years in his own hairdressing salon, which he opened with initial investment of 15,000 soms. Now he makes 8,000 soms monthly.  With the help of the profits from the business, he was able to buy cattle for 10,000 soms. He could increase the size of his cattle herd and he wants to go further. He wants to buy additional cattle for breeding. Therefore he is applying for a loan. With the profits from cattle breeding, he plans to buy a big house for his family, as well as a car. \r\n\r\n- Chynara A. is thirty-three and married. She has four children: her daughters are nine, six and one, and her son is eleven years old. Her elder son and daughter go to school and her youngest two daughters are at home. Her husband is a construction worker in Bishkek (capital of Kyrgyzstan). When her husband decided to move to Bishkek in search of employment opportunities, she (upon the suggestion of a friend) decided to start selling convenience goods. She started two years ago with an initial investment of 35,000 soms. Now she makes 15,000 soms monthly. With the profits from her business, she bought furniture and household appliances for her house. She is applying for a loan in order to purchase additional goods and increase her turnover. Through the increase of her turnover, she will be able to increase her profits.

Thekla thanks you for your support!\n\t\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":319858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

With the help of his wife, they are able to handle many of the things they need in life. However, they want to improve their livelihoods and have a sustainable business. So Cirilo decided to take out a loan as a means to achieve their family\u2019s goals. Cirilo said, \u201cWe should be patient in order to have a productive lifestyle.\u201d\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":328638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Business capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"St. Tomas Alicia, Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T03:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cirilo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T11:46:13Z","rounded_local_amount":20023.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96883632}],"funded_date":"2009-06-02T09:56:16Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T11:46:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kay and Fred Tierney","image":92188}},{"id":116823,"name":"Mumindjon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0443\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0443\u043d\u043e\u0432  1957 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 5 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439.  \u0418\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041e\u043d \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0427\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043c\u0438. \u0422\u0440\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 \u043e\u043d \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0436\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u0430\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u043b\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u0418 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0430\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0434\u044b\u043d\u044c. \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e 2 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438. \u0418 \u043e\u043d \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0435. \u0412 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043a  \u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0446\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043c, \u043d\u0430  \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u043d \u0441\u0430\u043c \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0435\u0442. \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u0442 \u041a\u0418\u0412\u0410 \u043e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442  \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0438.","en":"Mumindjon T. was born in 1957, he is married and has five children.

Gulnora works hard in order to make the business successful and to generate a stable income for the family. Today Gulnora is planning to purchase the cattle for her household to raise and sell.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They had to look for a way to generate their own incomes through their businesses, with the objective supporting their households economically.\r\n\r\nDoris is 36 years old, and is the mother of three children aged 15, 13 and 5.  When she was 29 she took the initiative to start preparing meals typical of the sierra region (wheat soup, noodles, spicy wheat, dried potatoes, yuyo); she took them in baskets and pots out to sell in the markets to the vendors and people passing through.  She was there for a fair amount of time and her sales were very good; the traders liked her food as this type of meal was not generally available.  The income from these sales paid for her food expenses, and for her children's education at the time when her husband did not have a job.  Later, she stopped selling because she had to care for her last child, but this did not stop her from beginning to sell groceries from the house.  With money that she saved from her previous work she bought: a sack of rice, 1 1\/2 sacks of sugar, a dozen units of milk and tuna, salt and detergent.  Loans that she received in the past enabled her to set up her business and  generate more income so that she was be able to buy school supplies for her children and enroll them in school.  In addition she improved her home, installing a tank of potable water and putting in an iron window.  This business pays for her family's expenses, given that the salary of her partner is not sufficient to cover them.  Doris wants a better quality of life for her children and to finish construction on her home.  With this loan she will buy sweets, milk, cooking oil, toilet paper, tuna and soft drinks.  \r\n\r\nJuana is 47 years old and is the mother of 2 children.  She and her partner have a business selling fish from a stand.  To do this she gets up very early at 5:30am to buy the merchandise that she needs at the fishing terminal Villa Mar\u00eda in Lima.

The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling fruits and vegetables in the local community. Nida has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nida is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Nida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: canteen and farming businesses. Her husband Jose M., who is 62 years old, works as a cook in their canteen to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are 18 to 32 years old.\r\n\r\n Juliet joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Juliet has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 60,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to pay for more raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future to get into the pig-raising business. \r\n\r\nJuliet M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n About NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling junk food, bananas, charcoal and coconut wine in the local community. Rosie has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 12,000 PHP a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Rosie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from HSPFI. This was used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. Rosie is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional junk food, charcoal and bananas. This will be the seventh loan that Rosie has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \n\nAbout HSPFI:\n\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Since she was very young she helped her mother attend the small grocery store that was installed in her house. Currently she has her own grocery store and it is well stock with all types of food products, personal hygiene products, and household cleaning products. Her husband helps her to attend the business. Their advantage is that there is no competition because they live in a small community in the outskirts of the city. All of her neighbors visit her store to purchase. With the requested loan she will be able to stock her business and with the profits she obtains she will have an income with which to support her family. Her greatest longing is to be a mother but unfortunately she is unable to become one. So if God permits it she will adopt a little one to give all of her care and love. Her goal is to convert her grocery store into a mini market.

Today she owns and runs two stores specializing in beverages, but it took an impressive amount of dedication and initiative to accomplish what she has. Four years ago, Flor Mar\u00eda had a small stand selling prepared meals in one of the local markets in Ayacucho, Per\u00fa. It was a difficult way to make a living, as the flow of customers was often unreliable due to extremely high rates of competition. In order to improve her economic situation she decided to make a change and open a store specializing in beverages. She supplies all types of sodas and juices, but her big seller is the \u201ccerveza.\u201d Little by little, Flor Mar\u00eda store grew and attracted more customers and she was eventually able to open a second store. \r\n\r\nToday, Flor Mar\u00eda has hired two \u201cse\u00f1oritas\u201d who take care of all the sales and customer service, while Flor Mar\u00eda handles all the administrative duties for the two stores. She builds relationships with her suppliers, watches her product flow carefully to decide what should be stocked, and everything else that goes along with running a small business. It\u2019s hard work and she always seems to have a million things on her to-do list, but she loves her job.\r\n\r\nFlor Mar\u00eda\u2019s next goal is to open a third store in Ayacucho. She is an obviously ambitious woman who is constantly looking for ways to bring her business to the next level. This is why she loves her village bank. It has taught her responsibility, punctuality, and how to save money in the bank where it accumulates interest.

In that time they have learned how to save, how to use their money more effectively, and how to be responsible.  In addition they learned how to avoid domestic violence and how to more effectively prevent sickness.  They like the community bank because it is simple.  At other banks you have to wait a long time and fill out many forms.  <p>\r\nBertha is 30 years old.  She is a single mother and has one six-year-old child.  Her neighbor invited her to join the bank, and she started with just a $50 loan.  At this time she sold vegetables at several regional markets.  Now, with the help of the community bank, she owns a clothing store, and has been able to build a house.  <p>\r\nFrancisca is sixty years old.  She is a widow and has eight adult children.  Francisca never learned to read, and has been working all of her life.  She grows potatoes in the region of Ayacucho, and with a van she was able to purchase with a bank loan, she transports them to the jungle eight hours away.<p>\r\nDora is thirty-three.  She lives with her partner and two children.  She joined the bank twelve years ago when it was just starting out with $2 to her name.  At the time she sold candies on one of the streets of Ayacucho.  Since then she has been able to buy a house and start a new, and more profitable business, selling clothing.<p>\r\nBertha, Francisca, and Dora need loans of 600, 2000, and 600 soles (3 soles = $1), which they will invest in buying clothing, and raising potatoes.<p>\r\nOne of the most important aspects of the community bank is the interest earning savings account each associate has. Bertha, Francisca, and Dora plan to use their savings to put a second floor on their home, buying another field, and adding a roof to their home.  Their dreams are to finish building their home, not have to travel to Lima as frequently, and to see their children happy and healthy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":124548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Bertha, Francisca, and Dora need loans of 600, 2000, and 600 soles (3 soles = $1), which they will invest in buying clothing, and raising potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-02-03T22:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Berha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora Hilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-18T21:02:05Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2008-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2008-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2008-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2008-03-18T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":805.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160704},{"amount":275,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2008-04-18T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":805.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":185667},{"amount":275,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2008-05-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":805.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":213357},{"amount":275,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2008-06-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":805.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":241549}],"funded_date":"2008-02-04T21:02:05Z","paid_date":"2008-06-18T09:08:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":38992,"name":"Kibibi's Msimamo Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kibibi S., age 47, is married and has six children (ages 30, 27, 18, 14, 12 and 6).
