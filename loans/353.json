He demonstrates this with his coffee crops, where he applies all of his knowledge. He relates that, in order to renew and improve his plantings, he needs an average of 8 thousand nuevos soles. He needs a little more to have even, good quality beans. That is why at every harvest he sells his beans to the cooperative of Alto Palomar where he is a member. He is looking for a better bean. In addition, he is planting plantains as an alternative crop, to ensure his income. Every two weeks he picks the ripe fruit to sell it. He has been doing this for 20 years, but states that before he didn't have the knowledge that he has now. That is why he is sure that he will attain his goal, buying more arable land.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Her husband has a business processing \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Phytelephas\" target=\"_blank\" >tagua<\/a>\u201d (the hard white coating of a specific palm seed that is used as a substitute for elephant ivory), which he buys at the port of Manta.

Tania says she wants to finish her studies and graduate from beauty school to become a stylist since she would very much like to have that profession.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":544147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase \"tagua\" (a substitute for elephant ivory)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-04T10:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tania Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.32,"local_amount":183.32,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:10Z","rounded_local_amount":183.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892538},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632884},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846918},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113379},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406958},{"amount":45.87,"local_amount":45.87,"processed_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":45.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406959}],"funded_date":"2010-06-04T13:23:22Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":208233,"name":"Nimer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nimer is a 32 year old married Lebanese entrepreneur.

She is an extremely hardworking woman who lives in her own home with her husband Teodoro, age 34, and their three beloved children for whom she wants to provide a better life.  Clotilde and her husband work together every day on their land.  Through much effort, they have been able to make their land productive so that they can grow a little bit of everything.  They know that whatever they produce will be of quality.  Clotilde grows primarily cacao, coffee, turmeric, and coca leaves.  These products are in great demand at the market.  What she enjoys most about her work is protecting her crops from plagues of insects that could negatively impact them.  On some occasions, she is not able to achieve a sufficient harvest and thereby earns less income.  Clotilde has been farming for twelve years and considers the most difficult part to be transporting her crops to the city of San Francisco to be sold.  In the future, she hopes to save the necessary funds to buy additional farmland.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan Clotilde has received from MFP.  She feels that this loan will be a great help in developing her business.  Clotilde is known in her Communal Bank for being a very responsible member, a distinction of which she is proud.  The loan she requested will be used to buy traps and insecticides for combating pests that are attacking her crops.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAngela dreams to be able to give her whole family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

With the money she requests she will buy groceries to stock in her store, such as rice, sugar, and tins of milk.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shaun Haines, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":291467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Stocking up staple goods in her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T23:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":127.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012301},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:39Z","rounded_local_amount":127.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595883},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":127.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990150},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":127.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211276},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":127.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640786},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":127.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080248},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":127.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996496},{"amount":40.66,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":127.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842004}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T01:44:52Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shaun Haines","image":55908}},{"id":100875,"name":"Fely","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Fely P. is from Tudela, Misamis Occidental.

These items are procured at the grand marketplace of Koutiala.  Following the off-season, the crops are stored for a time, so that they gain in value.  And then they are sold at the same marketplace and at surrounding marketplaces at the retail level (often wholesale), in cash transactions, to customers generally from large cities.\r\n\r\nThe group members each intend to realize, after selling their produce, an average profit of 50,000 francs CFA, which will be used to repay the loan and to cover common family expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":329685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and minor supplies and equipment ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Denise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata Andr\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djen\u00e8 Abou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anique ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noumousso ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatouma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnesse Filbert ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delphine Eug\u00e9nie  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":440000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":440000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":440000,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":451322.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152128}],"funded_date":"2009-07-08T08:05:13Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":117259,"name":"Mary Kim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Kim D.

She is a single mother of two children who completed 9th grade. In the past, Blanca has received two previous loans of 500,000 colones,each that were repaid on time and in full. This will be her third loan from Fundacion Mujer and she is happy to be applying for a larger amount than she has in the past (650,000 colones).\r\n\r\nThe name of Blanca\u00b4s business is \"Confecciones M.\" (M. Apparel). Blanca makes and alters clothing. Her specialty is creating children's pajamas. She makes more profit from selling pajamas than from other types of clothing. She also makes women\u2019s clothes (blouses, skirts) and offers various customized products.\r\n\r\nBlanca sells her clothes to a distributor who comes to her home in Santa Barabara every 15 days. The distributor purchases children\u2019s pajamas (for ages 12 and under) and women\u2019s clothing to sell throughout Costa Rica. Blanca has been in this business for 20 years. She opened her business with an initial investment of 125,000 colones from loans from a friend and her sister. In a good month, she can earn 500,000 colones; in a bad month, only 300,000. Blanca plans to use this loan to purchase raw materials and invest in a new sewing machine.\r\n\r\nBlanca has been sewing all her life. She has been making clothes for as long as she can remember. She is a hard-working woman who dedicates 12 hours each day to her business. The income she earns from sewing is the only source of income for her family. Her goal is to open a boutique where she can sell children's clothes. \r\n\r\nDue to the high costs of raw materials, Blanca has not been able to re-invest in her business. Her lack of necessities, such as elastic, fabrics, sewing thread, and other raw materials, have hampered her businesses growth. This loan will enable Blanca to purchase larger quantities of raw materials from her suppliers in San Jose. By purchasing in volume, she is confident that she will be able to secure better prices. With this loan, Blanca hopes to generate more income and provide a higher standard of living for her children.

She works six days a week in a semi-urban area on the outskirts of Kampala.  She serves an average of 10 customers a day and sells to all categories of people at retail and wholesale prices.

Her major business challenge is transportation of bales of products like mats, tablecloths, and hats.   Assa has been in this business for five years and with MCDT for twelve years. She is currently on her twelfth loan, working with the same group mates. Assa joined MCDT because it was near her home and was working with poor women.

Despite the difficult economic situation that he has gone through, he has managed to support his family and provide his five children with everything they need. To develop his business, Bekmurod has made use of loans provided by IMON International, which he has used toward technical assistance for his crops. \r\n\r\nOnce again, Bekmurod seeks loan support from IMON International to invest in his crops, later raise his harvest, and survive along with his family. With your help, Bekmurod will be able to get ahead.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Meet Esther, a hardworking, dedicated and honest 46-year-old dairy farmer. As the key breadwinner of her family, with a husband and three children, she farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Chuka, in the central region of Kenya. For the past ten years, she has been practicing mixed farming and her primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crop selling. She also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income she earns through farming. \nEsther passionately loves dairy farming but the biggest challenge she faces is feeding her cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. She is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit and to buy a chaff cutter. The dairy unit will assist Esther in managing her cows well and also protecting them from the harsh weather conditions. Esther also intends to buy a chaff cutter which is a mechanical device that is used in cutting hay into smaller pieces so that cows wont refuse any part of the food. The selling price for milk is 40 Kenya shillings per liter and through this loan she will be making more money. Esther will increase her income from milk selling and her cows will have more food to eat and never reject food. The key to high yield in milk production is proper feeding of the cows and through this loan, Esther will achieve this. An increase in income will allow Esther to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. Her dream is to continue improving her dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards. Esther fears that her dreams might not be realized if Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders cease to provide their reliable market channel, credit facility and services that she requires to grow her dairy enterprise.\n\nYou can help Esther to be closer to her goals, and a loan will do

Nigora\u2019s sister-in-law helps with selling products. <P>Six months ago, Nigora received a loan from Microinvest that helped her to expand her assortment of products. At the moment, one can find anything that is needed for the home in her shop. <P>If Nigora can get a second loan, it will help her to develop her business further and make more profit. This is very important as Nigora has three kids and her business brings in significant income for the family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":50859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She buys her stock from Kampala, usually on Thursday and Saturday. She is happy with this business, though at times there are setbacks due to the changing seasons.

She has worked in agriculture since the age of 20. She is a native of the same place that she lives, so every day she and her family work hard caring for animals and taking them to the pastures. The route takes them 2 hours to walk; it is almost nightfall when they return to put the animals in their stable and to rest. When it is sowing time, the farm work takes more time. As a result, even the youngest children help with this work. The main crops for Melania are the tubers and grains, like potatoes, oca, olluco, barley, peas, etc. She uses the plow with the 2 bulls that she has.

She is a strong business woman involved in the sale of agricultural produce for 8 years now. A brief background of her business is that she started very small with selling matooke as a retailer but now sells on wholesale to other people in the same business. Her biggest challenge is the scarcity of produce especially during bad seasons which hikes the prices of everything, but with the loans and availability of capital, all this becomes history. Her business centre is Kiyoola and she is able to make weekly profits of 80,000\/= hence being able to meet her family needs and saving for her children\u2019s education.

She lives with her husband and children. The couple cover the household expenses between them. In order to provide for her needs, Florence sells haberdashery supplies at the market in S\u00e9kou. At the same time she is also a seamstress. Florence has three years of experience in this domain and gets her supplies in Cotonou, the economic capital of B\u00e9nin. She is on her second loan from ALID\u00e9. She repaid the first loan without incident and is applying for another loan to strengthen her business and increase her profits.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":494459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase sewing supplies, zippers, button, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Allada","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-03-01T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-27T23:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":13549.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130495260},{"amount":29.7,"local_amount":13200,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":14308.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136619429},{"amount":26.55,"local_amount":11800,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":12790.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835432},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":13549.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575829},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-29T07:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":13549.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954344},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":13549.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056002},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:30:27Z","rounded_local_amount":13549.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347536},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":13549.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482619}],"funded_date":"2010-03-02T00:46:41Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":183685,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria R. is one of the very good members of ASHI in San Jose, a province of Antique.

Just like with other unemployed men in town, this has become the main business of Gloria\u2019s husband.

Meet Emily, a mother of two lovely children aged 13 and 7. Emily is based in Kimaring, a remote village in the rich highland areas of Kapsowar area of Kenya. This area is known for producing the best milk and their staple food is \u201cmursik,\u201d a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from milk. Emily has been practicing mixed farming for the past 4 years and she has made great strides in terms of profit margins. This small scale farmer generates income through selling milk, poultry, crops and some personal business that she does, or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to call it. She passionately loves poultry farming and the best part is when she wakes up every morning to collect eggs. The main challenge facing Emily is the constant perennial shortages of eggs and poultry products in her village and local market. She seeks to change this through borrowing a loan and buying more poultry. Emily is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. With the loan, Emily will increase her income through selling eggs, poultry meat and also poultry feathers. The demand for poultry products in Kapsowar area is very high and through the loan she will be able to satisfy the demand. Other than profits from poultry farming, she will also benefit from poultry manure, hence saving money that would have been used in purchasing fertilizers. The additional income from this expansion will permanently change her life and improve her living conditions. Emily waits for your kindness.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2038676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5407.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5565.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5727.94},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5895.34},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6067.63},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6244.96},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6427.47},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6615.31},{"due_date":"2016-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6808.64},{"due_date":"2016-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7007.63},{"due_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7212.43},{"due_date":"2016-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":7423.21},{"due_date":"2016-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":7640.15},{"due_date":"2017-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":7863.44},{"due_date":"2017-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":8093.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.07},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.65},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.28},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.68},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.28},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.15},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.09},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.08},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.12},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.23},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.4},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.64},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":991740,"name":"Jeannine Faramalala","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Jeannine a 50 ans, elle est veuve.

In 1997 she moved to Matutuine and started a commercial business with her husband purchasing products in bulk and selling it at retail to the local community.

To supply the best, high-quality products to their customers, they decided to ask Hluvuku for a loan. With the loan of 400 dollars, they intend to increase the volume of their business by acquiring more products and guaranteeing a sufficient stock to meet customer demands. The business has a positive impact on the local community by providing groceries close to the community and at affordable prices.

from Mbeya, Tanzania! Esteria K. is 27 years old. She is married and has three children, ages 5,7 and 10.  She has two other dependents, who are her brothers in-law. In 1997, Esteria established a crops business. Esteria now requests a loan in order to purchase crops in bulk. \r\n\r\n<P>\r\nAbout SELFINA <P>\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing.

When a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":126458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-02-11T16:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esteria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-25T18:16:46Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-03-25T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":53889,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":165949},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-04-25T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":53889,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191733},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-05-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":53889,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":219396},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-06-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":53889,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":248530},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-07-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":53889,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277086},{"amount":45,"local_amount":49090.91,"processed_date":"2008-08-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52717.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":306650}],"funded_date":"2008-02-11T18:16:46Z","paid_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":39444,"name":"Muharam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muharam O. is 25 years old.

Since she split up with her husband she has been selling ice cream as she had to take charge of her young son alone and give him an education, clothing and keep him healthy.  Lucia is used to making ice creams at night so she can sell them during the mornings and afternoons.  The difficulty in doing this is the climate as in that area it is very cold and it is the rainy season, which means that her sales decrease.  However, on the other hand Lucia has some faithful clients who really love her delicious ice creams, and this keeps her spirits up.  Lucia goes to great lengths so allow her son to move forward and to give him a better future.  With the money she's asked for she would like to buy a new ice box to sell ice creams from, as the one she has now is very worn, and this will increase her production.

She always thought about having a business and, thanks to her partner, she managed to install a pharmacy that provides services for her district.  She has been attending to her customers very responsibly for more than 10 years, trying to provide the best medications to help restore health.  Regardless, she didn\u2019t always have all the necessary items in her inventory.  At the onset of her business, she only carried basic medicines and this limited her sales.  Over time, however, she took advantage of the demand and acquired display cases and windows and saw the need to rent a large enough space in her district.  This is where she works to this day.  Her business has been expanding, and Marlene hopes to open another drugstore soon.  She hopes that, through her and her husband\u2019s efforts, they will manage to reach their goals.

Elsa is requesting a loan of 2,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be her first from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

","en":"\r\nBertha is 43 years old, married with 8 children.  She lives in her own home in Santa Rosa which is located in the beautiful Ayacuchan jungle.  Like her parents before her, she is involved in agriculture which is how she received her first wages.  She was happy to work and enjoyed what she was doing.  Without giving it a second thought, she followed in her parent\u2019s path.  \r\n\r\nAfter a while, she started to grow a product that generated significant income in a short time.  For this reason, she dedicated herself to growing coca leaves.  Her strategy is to work in her fields from 5:00am until 6:00pm.  She sells her produce locally to middlemen.  Normally she works alone, but occasionally she receives help from her children and together they make a great team.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her own home in the community of Huaylahuichan with her husband and 2 children. Leonor started doing agricultural work when she was young. Little by little, thanks to her neighbors' initiative, she was able to get into the business of buying and selling guinea pigs. She sells them every week, making 5 to 10 soles per cuy. She also has a small store in her house, where she sells basic necessity products such as rice, sugar, oil, etc., making 80 to 90 soles a day. Her husband works in transportation with his own car. \"I have had several problems in the last few years, first the lack of capital, the lack of personnel, lost crops, but we have been able to face them and now we are fine.\" Leonor remarks. She hopes that after saving enough, she can send her children to the city of Lima so they can get college educations and look for jobs in different areas. Maybe after time, she will be able to join them. This loan would be the 13th that Leonor will get from MFP, because she needs help to continue with her goals. About the communal bank, she remarks that she likes it and feels comfortable with the work system. With the money, Leonor will be able to start a new crop for the season of April and May. She will plant peas, and for that she will buy bags of fertilizer.

Maria Elena hopes to see all three complete a university education.  A native of Villarrica, Maria Elena moved to Carapegu\u00e1 nineteen years ago with her husband, a mechanic who runs his own auto body shop.  A neighbor woman taught her to weave hammocks and shawls, and since then she has dedicated herself to weaving to earn extra money for her family. Today, Maria Elena is one of the best weavers in the city.  She works every day, and when she has a certain number of shawls prepared takes them to shops in the city center to sell, even selling them in neighboring cities.  The business has grown in part thanks to previous lines of credit.  At this time she would like to borrow $50 to buy cotton thread and cloth and expand her production to meet demand.  A member of Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya since December of last year, Maria Elena is part of the New Horizons Women's Union, a group of fifteen neighbors who together guarantee each loan and pledge to save 10% of their weekly payments.  <p> <b> Translated by a Kiva volunteer. <\/b> <p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Elena Ruiz D.

Thanks to the good relationship they have with the institution, including facilitator Mar\u00eda Quieju, the group has decided to take out another loan. <p>\r\nWithin this communal bank, one can find enterprising women of all types \u2013 some resell American clothes and sell shoes via catalogue, others are weavers and jewelers, while another section embroiders typical regional blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d. <p>\r\nThe members are going to invest their portion of the loan in their distinctive areas. For example, the weavers are planning to purchase blue, purple and white threads to make huipiles. The embroiderers are planning to purchase threads of all colors to embroider birds, flowers and Mayan symbols on the blouses. Others will invest in the purchase of jewelry beads to make earrings, necklaces, purses, key chains, belts and bracelets. Meanwhile, another member is going to purchase American clothes in the capital to resell in Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n. <p>\r\nCurrently the women are working with another loan financed through \u201cmicrofinanzas 9\u201d in which they must repay it plus interest in stages every 42 days. <p>\r\nThe group decided to opt for this kind of loan due to the fact that the work they do generates income only after some months have passed. For example, the weavers purchase the thread and then a month later they finish the blouse. The embroiderers can take between one and three months to complete their work. For the women who buy and sell American clothing, although they do that fairly quickly, with their margins it takes time for them to generate sufficient income to pay off their debts. <p>\r\nThis group of women has already been working together and it\u2019s important to keep supporting it. Their respective businesses have been slowly growing and if we support them now it\u2019s possible for their small businesses to start to take off.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n<P>El banco comunal Maya Tzutujil 1 ha venido trabajando con Friendship Bridge por m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o. Debido a la buena relaci\u00f3n que han tenido con la instituci\u00f3n, por medio de la facilitadora Mar\u00eda Quieju, ellas han decidido sacar otro pr\u00e9stamo. \r\n\r\n<P>Dentro de este banco comunal uno puede encontrar empresarias de todo tipo hay quienes revenden ropa americana y venden zapatos por cat\u00e1logo, otras tejedoras, un grupo que bordan blusas t\u00edpicas llamadas huipiles, joyeras \r\n\r\n<P>Las clientas van a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en distintas \u00e1reas. Por ejemplo las tejedoras est\u00e1n pensando en comprar hilos de colores celestes, morados y blancos para tejer huipiles. Las bordadoras est\u00e1n pensando en comprar hilos de todos los colores para bordar aves, flores y s\u00edmbolos mayas. Otras van a invertir en comprar bolitas de mostacilla para elaborar aretes, collares, monederos, llaveros, cinturones y pulseras. Mientras que una clienta va a comprar ropa americana en la capital para luego revenderla en Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n.  \r\n\r\n<P>Actualmente, ellas est\u00e1n trabajando con el producto financiero \u201cmicrofinanzas 9\u201d. En este producto las mujeres tienen que repagar capital m\u00e1s inter\u00e9s en nueve plazos cada cuarenta y dos d\u00edas. \r\n\r\n<P>Ellas decidieron optar por este producto debido a que el trabajo que tienen genera ingresos despu\u00e9s de unos meses. Por ejemplo, las tejedoras compran el hilo y despu\u00e9s de un mes terminan un huipil. Las artesanas que bordan huipiles pueden tomarse de uno a tres meses en bordar un huipil. Las mujeres que venden y compran ropa americana a pesar de comprar y vender de manera r\u00e1pida la utilidad generada por venta es muy poco es por eso que necesitan tiempo para repagar su deuda.\r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de mujeres ya ha venido trabajando juntos y es importante apoyarlas ya que tienen \u201cviada\u201d. Sus respectivos negocios han venido creciendo de a poquitos y si las apoyamos ahora cabe la posibilidad de que sus micro empresas despeguen. \u00a1Denles esa

She lives in the house of a relative, and what she wishes for most is to live out her old age in peace.  Sebastiana sells used toys she buys in Bolivia at the Sunday market in the city of Juliaca.  The toys she brings are in excellent shape, and she also washes them so they are disinfected before she offers them for sale.  For this reason, they sell quickly.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her work is seeing the smiles on the children\u2019s faces when they hold one of her toys in their hands.  She has been carrying out this activity for 10 years, and finds the most difficult aspect of her work to be transporting her stuffed animals as the bundles are very heavy and she gets tired.

As we can see in the photo, there are 12 members in the group named Mirador de Matilde, to showcase their location in the state of Hidalgo.\nMaria Alicia is a single mother of two children, who work and help her with some of the household expenses. She sells chicken and is requesting this loan to invest in a new scale, because the one she has does not work well. She also wants to paint her business so that it will look its best. She mentions that she works very hard, Monday to Saturday, with the aim of saving up for when she is no longer able to work. However, for now she greatly enjoys her business and the most gratifying element is her rapport with her customers.\nThe group's treasurer is Martha Silvia F., who has sold beauty products through a catalogue for 8 years. She is in a common-law marriage and has two children ages 24 and 13. She is requesting this loan to invest in a larger inventory which she will buy at a lower price and thus be able to make more profit. She has a large number of customers thanks to her years of experience selling these products.\nThe group members are hard-working and enterprising women; Gizeh B., for example, is 24, married and has a 5-year-old child. She sells gifts and will invest her credit in material to decorate the gifts she wraps, and to buy glass for her display case, since some of the panes are broken. At this moment, this is what she needs for her business in order to earn a little bit more. She believes that success is the result of daily work, and she would like to see her business grow significantly because she knows that with it she will be able to offer her little child a better life.\n\nThe other group members are:\n\nElvira Hern\u00e1ndez Ram\u00edrez\t         Quilt sales\nYadira Mart\u00ednez D.

For 15 years she has cultivated coffee, citrus fruits, and bananas on the land she inherited from her parents. Meanwhile, her husband works as a driver of heavy vehicles for the city. During the weekends, she and her husband provide appropriate care for her plantings. What Norma likes most is harvesting, because she can sell the fruits that she gathers at a good price, which she can reinvest to improve her production. This activity is very profitable for her, because she can pay her  expenses without any worry, and she can also live comfortably and offer the best to her children. In addition, she can save for big future projects, since she confesses that in the future, she is planning to acquire a rural property and plant a larger quantity of natural products that grow in the central jungle of Peru. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP, and she says that she likes to work with her community bank because she saves and learns from the educational talks that this institution offers.

R. will purchase corn husks, meat, dried chilies, milk, sugar, cinnamon and rice to make tamales and warm corn flour drinks.   Antolina Cornelio X. F. will purchase new catalogues to restock her business with linen and blankets in various sizes.  Maria Elena O. M. will purchase a grill, chairs, sacks of corn on the cob, cheeses, powdered chili for the corn, and for corn drink. \r\n\r\nHumberto Eduardo M. R. is the representative of the group. He is 40 years old and he has a grade 9 education. He lives together with his wife and their 6-year old daughter named Anel. She attends primary school. Humberto requests a loan to invest in his business, selling corn flour drinks and tamales. He will use it to purchase corn husks, lard, meats, cups, spoons, napkins, sugar, chilies, corn flour, milk, cinnamon and rice. He started his business 20 years ago for the lack of paid work. He used to work one or two days a week so he started selling corn drinks and tamales. His business has been very successful. He started out selling his products from buckets but with time he started to save money and he purchased an adult tricycle which helped him to go all over town. He goes to gas stations and along the streets to sell his corn drinks and tamales. He sells to the entire population of the village and to tourists that stop to purchase ornate clay objects and pottery.  He is proud of his business because with it he has been able to purchase a plot of land where he lives and where he is building a house. The house where he lives is made of wood and aluminum sheeting, but he is saving money to make the walls out of bricks and the roof of concrete. \r\n\r\nHe faces competition from others that work in the same business, selling the same products. He invests his earnings in part to cover the family\u2019s expenses, in part to continue building their house, and he also invests a part of his earnings back into the business. \r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys most of his work is completing a sale. It is very important because it feeds and supports his family. His dreams are to see his house completed and beautiful. He also wishes to see his daughter attend school and achieve a career and a have a good job. He is very happy and content and in good health. He is glad about the loan he is granted he wishes to thank Kiva and Fundacion Realidad for the trust imparted to them by this loan and future loans. \r\n\r\nThe village of Tlayacapan is quiet and clam and every one knows the members of the group. The region is very friendly and it is known by tourists for its clay pottery. It is a lovely village where everything is green with vegetation and there is a magical history of the surrounding mountains, commonly known as The Little Sombrero, Butterfly, and The Little Window. The church was once a convent. It is also the birthplace of chinelos, colorfully dressed dancers.  In the months of February and March up to 5 days before Ash Wednesday there are weekly fairs, on Friday to Tuesday every week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":593982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase corn husks, lard, meats, cups, spoons, napkins, sugar, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tlayacapan, estado de Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-09-07T14:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eutimio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Humberto Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antolina Cornelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4564.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121204},{"amount":175,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2282.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415352},{"amount":175,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2282.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415353},{"amount":525,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6847.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554958},{"amount":95.13,"local_amount":1223.16,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1240.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691448},{"amount":79.87,"local_amount":1026.84,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1041.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430868}],"funded_date":"2010-09-09T19:17:14Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":232879,"name":"Merrylou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merrylou C. is from the village of Bantuanon, Lantapan, Bukidnon.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They contribute and together they want to progress. Since she was very young, this enterprising woman she learned from her father when he made curtains. Since then it has been her focus to learn to sew. When she needed to provide for her children she had no doubt about using the skills that she learned and she started making articles of clothing. She is very happy because she has various orders that are placed for the season and she tries to fill them all with the help of her 15-year old daughter who excels in using the sewing machine.  She says that the schools in the region also place orders for jackets and school uniforms which is why she often has orders.
