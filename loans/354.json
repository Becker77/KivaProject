Fe Cebu City. She earns her living by buying and selling of coconuts and also by pig fattening.\r\n\r\nRosemarie\u2019s 45-year-old husband, Victor, is a farmer; the couple has 6 children.  One of their children has a family to raise already while the other 5 are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nRosemarie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by buying and selling coconuts as well as pig fattening. Now she earns an average monthly income of 8,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) from her businesses.\r\n\r\nRosemarie is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP was used to fund operations of her coconut business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 11th cycle loan, in the amount of 11,000 PHP, which she intends to use for both the coconut and pig-fattening businesses. Rosemarie is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":560257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lives in Hillside, Daanbantayan, Cebu, and she has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007. Combined with her individual efforts, Vergenia has improved her living conditions with the help of the loans from NWTF. By working hard in her general store she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5000. \n\nVergenia is borrowing PHP 25000 so she can purchase more inventory for her general store, and this will be her 7th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP18000 was paid off well within its term, and it was another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Vergenia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \n\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They harvest on average 100 kg of strawberries per year and sell them on the local market. \r\n\r\nThe family also runs a bee-keeping business: they own 35 bee-hives and bee colonies. 300 liters of honey are gathered and sold annually.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shakar, 47, is the leader of this group. She resides in the town of Nookat, known for its agricultural products of a high quality and taste. It\u2019s been ten years since she got involved in agriculture, following the example of most of her friends. Land feeds all residents of this town, therefore every resident is thankful for being born in a land with such rich soil and good climate. Shakar is a widow, however she has given a worthy life to all of her three kids, two of whom already have their own businesses. For ten years Shakar has been saving and gradually expanding the size of the land she owns. At this moment her piece of land is one of the largest in the neighborhood. This means that she cultivates a bigger amount of agricultural products and she needs more inputs such as water and fertilizers.  The initial capital of 1500 soms used ten years ago allowed Shakar to grow only one type of product, unlike now when Shakar grows a wide variety of products. However Shakar isn\u2019t always capable of covering  all her costs, especially fertilizers. For such big land and wide range of products, Shakar needs a large amount of different types of fertilizers. With this purpose she is applying  for a loan from Kiva.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She lives with her two youngest children, Jos\u00e9 and Antony, ages 16 and 4, in the \u201cLa Libertad\u201d parish.\r\n\r\nEight years ago, with the recommendation of her friends, she started selling shoes door to door.  She began selling to family and friends, but now her customer base has increased and sells men\u2019s and women\u2019s shoes.  She went though a financial crisis that was a bit difficult to get through, but thanks to her effort she was able to do so.  Now she has a great vision and wants to invest in more shoes, so she approached Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for a loan that will allow her to continue her work.  This will be her first loan through this institution.  The loan officer, after evaluating her business, saw Jane as a hard working entrepreneur with vision.\r\n\r\nJane expects to grow her business in order to give her children a better life and see them establish professional careers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":826009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy shoes for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2011-07-31T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane Albania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":735.28,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70.19},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":77.94},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":79.03},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":80.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":82.13},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":83.72},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":85.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":87.01},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":88.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.6},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.61},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.77},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.4},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":71.6,"local_amount":70.19,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":71.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797109},{"amount":79.5,"local_amount":77.94,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":79.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608214},{"amount":80.61,"local_amount":79.03,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-17T08:54:51Z","rounded_local_amount":80.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562556},{"amount":82.5,"local_amount":80.88,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":82.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250773648},{"amount":83.77,"local_amount":82.13,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":83.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182198},{"amount":172.78,"local_amount":169.39,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":172.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270032803},{"amount":88.75,"local_amount":87.01,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:34:38Z","rounded_local_amount":88.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645002},{"amount":90.49,"local_amount":88.71,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":90.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287092754}],"funded_date":"2011-08-24T14:40:20Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:04:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Today, with his wife Rolina, they both work on creating clothing with the knitting machine. Their knitting machine is in their house, and they work all day Monday through Friday, then on Saturday and Sunday they go out and sell the items they made at various markets throughout the city. The business is good because Jaime and Rolina work well together, being able to work together all day and take care of their small daughter Mirian. What is difficult is only having one knitting machine, they aren\u2019t able to produce the quantities that they would hope to and be able to generate more income. Their daughter Mirian is the focus of these parents, on her behalf they work day after day in order to give her a promising future.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Her cafe serves up a variety of traditional Mongolian dishes, but her most popular item is Huushuur, a deep fried flour pocket filled with meat. Her cafe is a preferred lunch spot in the community as huushuur is a quick and easy meal for many people on the go. \r\n\r\nA. started her cafe in 2005 and has since built a stable and successful operation. Her earnings have enabled her to buy a two-room apartment to house her cafe. She is very hardworking and has built her cafe into one of the most popular dining spots in her town.

This group consists of eleven members from the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica in the Cariari region. With this loan, each member will receive a deposit to invest at their discretion. These women have created The Women\u2019s Bank of Little Ants as a formal way to support one another as guarantors of each other\u2019s loans.\r\n\r\nThe Cariari region is located in the province of Limon. In this rural area, life has been difficult due to a lack of job opportunities, family responsibilities, low levels of formal education and a lack of available financial services. Their challenging situation has resulted in a communal initiative to create work for themselves by engaging wholeheartedly in the purchase, rearing and sale of pigs.\r\n\r\nIn order to fund the development of their businesses each woman is applying for a loan of 100,000 colons (roughly US$180). Their loans will be used to purchase piglets and nutritional food that will ensure their growth into quality livestock products. The pigs will be sold to people in the community for direct consumption or resale. From November to December is the high season for the group, the reason can be summed up in one word: Tamales. Tamales are a traditional Costa Rican food eaten at Christmas time and their main ingredient is pork. As customer needs for pork meat increase, so too do the revenues of the \u201cLittle Ants\u201d.\r\n\r\nFor many of the group members, the responsibility of raising a family has fallen solely on their shoulders, rendering the income generated from pig sales a vital source of income. Despite their entrepreneurial spirit, their efforts have been hamstrung, partly due to exclusion from the traditional banking system. This is where you, through Kiva\u2019s lending model, can help.\r\n\r\nYour contribution is a direct investment in the betterment of the lives of women living in a poor community of Caribbean Costa Rica. By lending to these proactive and hardworking entrepreneurs, you are enabling them to help themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Group Members\r\n\r\nThese women identify most with the struggle of \u201clittle ants\u201d. The members observe that \u201cants work together and support one another day and night, in order to build something that is bigger than themselves.\u201d This can be taken to symbolize the group\u2019s aspirations for growth and approval for more loans in the future. The following detailed description of Flor M. A. A. can be considered as generally applicable to all the women in the group: they are all participants in similar economic activities in the Caribbean region of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nFlor M. A. A. is the elected treasurer of this group. She is 38 years old and has not completed high school. She lives with her husband and two sons. Her husband is a farmer who grows plantains, rice and beans for family consumption and sells what he has left over.\r\n\r\nOn average, Flor earns 37,500 colons (roughly US$67) per month. At the moment, she has one pig; she would use this loan to purchase another. She would like to earn enough money from her pig-selling business so that she may buy a cow.\r\n\r\nFlor takes pride in managing her business with one hand while raising her children with the other. An obstacle for her, and for all the group members, is the high cost of nutrients for the pigs. Transportation is another challenge: walking to town to get the nutrients and hauling them back is a laborious task.

She feels that she will be able to afford the monthly payments to repay the communal bank.\r\n\r\nShe is well known in her neighborhood and has regular customers who buy her soft drinks daily, which she sells nice and cold the way her customers like.\r\n\r\nWith this 1,330 PEN ($475) loan, she will buy more soft drinks of different flavors, sizes and brands and also mineral water and bottled water.\r\n\r\nShe is proud for having succeeded at starting her business and is thankful to the \u201cManuela Ramos\u201d movement for helping her and other women to get ahead.  She would like to one day run a soft drink distributorship and become well recognized. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":483429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy soft drinks for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-09T20:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":216.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":227.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954526},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":227.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987552},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":227.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713578},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":227.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746624},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":227.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929797},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":216.65,"processed_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:06Z","rounded_local_amount":227.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159668973}],"funded_date":"2010-02-10T01:17:45Z","paid_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

business. She lives in Barangay Jantianon, Amlan, Negros Oriental with her 47 year old husband, Florencio, who works as a driver, and with their 2 children who are between 18-21 years old and are currently studying.\n\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her vegetable vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000.\n\nFedila is now borrowing PHP 19,500 so that she could continue her vegetable vending business. This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Fedela aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \n\n\n About NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":554398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

With the help of her past fifteen loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

San Mateo\u201d (The Roses of San Mateo) is located in the community of San Mateo Milpas Altas in Antigua Guatemala.  This group was started eighteen months ago with twelve women who engage in agriculture, tortilla production, and livestock breeding.  For this reason, they are utilizing loans from FAPE.  The \u201cRosas D. San Mateo\u201d Bank is in its fourth loan cycle with FAPE.  Their leader is Do\u00f1a Elida T..  She is married and has ten children, nine of whom still live with her in this small community.  Six of her children are students at the local school while one lives in Antigua and has a degree in elementary school education.  Do\u00f1a Elida dreams that her children will continue their studies so that they can have better opportunities in the future.  Her main business activity is farming.  She has been growing green beans, Chinese peas, and Creole peas on her own land for ten years with the help of her husband, children, and seasonal workers.    Elida will invest in her farming activities by paying to have her land plowed and cleared.  She has the seeds and compost needed for planting because it is necessary for her to have a good harvest and produce a quality crop. \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Elida T. Q. has had three previous loans with FAPE and has demonstrated that she is responsible and prompt when making all of her monthly payments.  Of all the services, she enjoys the established savings.  She is happy with the money she keeps with FAPE because it stays out of her hands and it helps with repaying her loan.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":594405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Invest in farming activities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Antigua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2010-09-03T19:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2375,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Elida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Salome ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Lidia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Candelaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alba Nineth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Ofelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guillermina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3166.6},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3166.68},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3166.68},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3166.68},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3166.68},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3166.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395.84},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":395.84},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":395.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":395.83,"local_amount":3166.6,"processed_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3187.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396342},{"amount":395.83,"local_amount":3166.68,"processed_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3188.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534897},{"amount":1583.34,"local_amount":12666.72,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":12752.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414979}],"funded_date":"2010-09-05T15:45:40Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:08:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":232507,"name":"Marivic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marivic A. is from the village of Malinao, Gingoog City.

This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to buy a large volume and variety of dried fish so that she can continue to save up for the future renovation of their house.

Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 to purchase some goods for her sari-sari store so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Liza is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Julienne is married to Nounangnon Djotchou, a fisherman by profession. Julienne is the mother of six children, but only two of them are still in her care. Julienne never went to school. Julienne was raised by her paternal grandmother, for whom she sold maize paste and fried fish. Maize paste, locally known as \"akassa\", accompanied by spices and fried fish, is a meal consumed by many Beninese.

Being parents, they are concerned with the future of their children.

They cultivate their farm lots in two cropping cycles by planting rice and vegetables. Due to the high cost of commodities and school expenditures, they need to earn more income to meet their daily needs and finance the tuition fees and allowances of their children. In this regard, Alma put up a small eatery in their village located at Brgy. Poblacion, Diadi, Nueva Vizcaya to earn additional income. She started this with a small amount of capital in which she can only earn a net income of P 500.00 per week. In this regard, she wants to improve it but she has inadequate capital. Therefore, she wants to borrow additional capital from KIVA lenders amounting to P 5,000.00 to be added to her capital to improve her small eatery. She wants to buy more ingredients for her eatery. She believes that with her patience and sacrifices, she will be able to improve her business and support the studies of their two

She began it with a lot of effort because her earnings were very low.  She began selling her cakes to her neighbors and in areas near her home.

desde hace un a\u00f1o a la venta de productos de primera necesidad y abarrotes en una bodega instalada en su domicilio. Ella ofrece los productos a sus vecinos, lo cual es de mucha ayuda ya que el caser\u00edo donde vive se encuentra a mas de media hora del pueblo de M\u00f3rrope y no tienen acceso r\u00e1pido a productos de consumo diario, por este motivo ella trata de manterer su negocio de la mejor manera posible, ofreciendo productos de calidad y un buen trato a sus clientes.\n\nRosita nos comenta que gracias a la bodega ella puede ayudar al sostenimiento de su familia, su esposo trabaja como pe\u00f3n agr\u00edcola y juntos tratan de solventar los gastos familiares. Adicionalmente ella tambi\u00e9n cr\u00eda y vende cerdos con lo que su unidad familiar percibe ingresos adicionales. Precisamente en la imagen nos muestra a una de sus cerdas que ha parido recientemente.\n\nElla desea ampliar su bodega de modo que pueda seguir atendiendo a sus clientes y aumentar sus ganancias. Por este motivo se ha visto en la necesidad de solicitar por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 800 nuevos soles que piensa utilizar en la compra de abarrotes para lograr su objetivo.\n\nRosita es una madre que trabaja siempre buscando el bienestar de su familia. Su mayor anhelo es brindarle a sus hijos la oportunidad de estudiar alguna carrera superior que les permita asegurarse un futuro prometedor. En la zona donde vive ella  es muy conocida y estimada por sus vecinos.\n ","en":"\r\nRosita, 37, is married and lives with her husband and their three children in the Lagunas settlement, a rural area of M\u00f3rrope district, Lambayeque province, located an hour and fifteen minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor the last year she has run a grocery store in her home.  She sells to her neighbors which is of great use to the settlement where she lives because it is over half an hour away from the town of M\u00f3rrope and there is no convenient access to items of daily consumption.  Because of this, she strives to keep her store stocked in the best possible way with quality products and good customer service.\r\n\r\nRosita tells us that thanks to earnings from her store she is able to support her family.\r\nHer husband works as a farmhand and together they strive to meet household expenses.  In addition, she raises pigs to earn additional family income.  As a matter of fact, in the photo she\u2019s with a sow that recently gave birth.\r\n\r\nShe wants to expand her store so that she can continue to provide service to her customers and increase her earnings.  For this reason, she has called upon Edpyme Alternativa for the first time to request an 800 new sol loan to buy stock items for her store.\r\n\r\nRosita is a mother who is always seeking her family\u2019s wellbeing.  Her greatest wish is to provide her children with the opportunity to study an advanced career that will insure them a promising future.  \r\n\r\nShe is well known and liked by her neighbors where she lives.\r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":529474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy stock merchandise for her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lagunas - M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-04-25T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":69.41},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":70.07},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":74.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75.69},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":78.21},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":81.29},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":82.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":87.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":89.2},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":91.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.03},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.98},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.39},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.32},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.49},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.04},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.45},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.03,"local_amount":69.41,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":73.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695171},{"amount":26.28,"local_amount":70.07,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":74.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878215},{"amount":27.98,"local_amount":74.63,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":79.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618243},{"amount":28.39,"local_amount":75.69,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":80.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832642},{"amount":29.32,"local_amount":78.21,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":83.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099250},{"amount":30.49,"local_amount":81.29,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":86.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554662},{"amount":31.04,"local_amount":82.78,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":88.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530084},{"amount":32.69,"local_amount":87.17,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":92.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666234},{"amount":33.45,"local_amount":89.2,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":94.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409570},{"amount":34.33,"local_amount":91.55,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":97.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108017}],"funded_date":"2010-04-26T17:42:59Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":199748,"name":"Olga","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuestra socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cKILLA\u201d; Nuestra socia vive en el distrito de Huanchac en la provincia de Cusco, departamento de Cusco.\n\nNuestra socia es la  Sra.

He makes and sells fast food in his business called \u201cDonde Rosenberg.\u201d He started two years ago selling deditos (cookies) by the tray.  However, because he\u2019s very curious and forward looking he took a fast food preparation course and asked his father for help.  His father gave him the money to buy a hotdog cart and some chairs.   \r\n\r\nThis is how he started to include hotdogs, salchipapas (fried potatoes with fried sausage), hamburgers and grilled meat and chicken skewers to his fast food.  A relative currently helps him with the work.  He also takes advantage of his sales point to sell minutes of cell phone air time which is an additional source of income.

With the help of her husband, she grows coffee which she harvests once a year, making considerable profits.  She tells us that her crops are young and don't require a great deal of maintenance.  However, she fertilizes them constantly to maintain their quality.  During the year, Carmen also works selling rainforest-bee honey.  The cost of this honey is very high because it has curative properties.  She sells an average of 20 kilos a day.  She tells us that she has 8 years experience in this business and has regular customers.  In addition, Augusto, her husband, works in the public transport business with a motorcycle taxi, covering the Pichanki to Sangani route.  This also makes them daily profits.\r\n\r\nThe current aim of this family is to improve their standard of living and expand their honey business.

Her only daughter, Mariluz, is 16 and lives in the city of Lima. Jacinta now lives alone in the house she owns in the community of Santa Rosa de Palomar in the province of Chanchamayo. Jacinta is an admirable woman. Her hard work and decisions have made it possible that Mariluz is educated in the capital. She doesn't mind living alone because she knows that ultimately her sacrifices will bring good results. Thanks to farming, she has been able to get ahead and cover her expenses. She has her own farmland where she plants coffee, plantains and avocado. In her region, coffee dominates the production. The work is hard and tiring, so she has to hire workers for cleaning, spreading manure and harvesting her products. The months of May and June are crucial for the coffee bean business. The buyers already know how to contact her. Jacinta isn't worried about her sales, just about her production.\r\n\r\nShe is aware that she won't be happy alone. After saving enough money, she will travel to Lima to live with her daughter. She will leave workers in charge of maintaining her crops, so they don't go uncared for. \r\n\r\nJacinta belongs to the communal bank \"Aroma de Cafe\" and this will be her second loan with MFP, whom she thanks for their support. She will be punctual in her repayments, as she was in the previous cycle. With the money she will buy bags of compost for her crops and will also pay the wages of the laborers that she will contract during the harvest.

Dengan memelihara 4 ekor penggemukan Wayan N. memenuhi kebutuhan hidup keluarganya lewat keuntungan- keuntungan yang diperolehnya. Dalam setiap enam bulan Wayan N. mendapat keuntungan Rp 1200.000,- yang kemudian dipergunakan untuk mencukupi biaya hidup sehari-hari dan biaya sekolah putrinya yang masih di SMP.

Her ability lies in her hands and creativity, which opened doors to dedicate herself to decorating.  Over time, this gave her incentive to specialize in making handicrafts and decorations for various events and milestones.  She has not stopped working for 16 years now, as people solicit her services for special occasions.  In the afternoons, she exhibits her precious decorations in her house, trying always to be ready if called to decorate a reception hall since sometimes events are unpredictable.  Likewise, she is always aware of current trends and latest changes in design, and she tries to specialize in her craft by taking classes in this area.  All of this sacrifice is aimed to help her open a store with two friends, who have the same desire to provide a diverse range of decorations for the home and they hope to create a large enterprise in the future.  This is her fourteenth loan with MFP and, since she became part of this group, she has tried to participate with her colleagues who are very dedicated to the development of the cooperative bank.

She is a hardworking woman who teaches different forms of dance to the children in her neighborhood.  In her free time, she sells a well-known brand of beauty products.  This work requires that she walk through the hills where she lives in order to find new customers.  During the summer the work can be very tedious and the heat is suffocating.  Nonetheless, she is successful with her sales.  Since she offers products on credit, her customers often do not pay on time so every day is a struggle for her to get ahead.  In the future, she plans to open a bookstore in her home and will enlist the help of her husband, who works as a mason.  Martha wants to start this business immediately and is very confident about pursuing it without having to abandon her cosmetics sales.  She is sure that it will go well because she is very knowledgeable about the area where she lives.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the sixth loan Martha has received and she is very grateful to everyone who made this loan possible so that she can continue to work.  She also promises to continue leading the other members of her Communal Bank and motivating them not to fall behind in their payments.  Martha plans to invest the money she requested in the purchase of school supplies so that she can move forward with her bookstore project. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":511743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase school supplies to stock her new bookstore","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-23T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718197},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751872},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934331},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673099},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886929},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:58Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153932}],"funded_date":"2010-03-24T00:27:23Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":191570,"name":"Kyehemba Turihamwe Group Of Kyenjojo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"It\u2019s now two-and-a-half years since an evergreen and enterprising N.

Merlyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Merlyn is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Merlyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling of fruits and vegetables in the local community.  Julieta has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Julieta joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Julieta is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Julieta from ASKI.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She lives in Bago City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Lorry is borrowing PHP 11,000 to fund her business operations. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Lorry aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She retails to a mixed-gender clientele from her home, door-to-door and in the 'Chateau de Segou' market, and accepts cash or credit.\r\nWith this loan, Oumou hopes to make an average monthly profit of 15,000 CFA, which will be used to reinvest in her activity and to pay for her children's healthcare."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":807429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy groundnuts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assetou                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paye                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":66666.66,"processed_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":68071.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120283},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":34035.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882116},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":34035.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699212},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":34035.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655477},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:45Z","rounded_local_amount":34035.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874273}],"funded_date":"2011-08-02T03:37:19Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Buecheler","image":566239}},{"id":318597,"name":"Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

Her husband works as a mason. \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s works as a housewife and sells Avon products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and accessories for women), in order to earn her own income and be able to help out her husband with the household expenses.  She works three days a week, mostly in the mornings while her daughters are in school.  This makes it easy for her to make her runs.  She sells on credit and collects every two weeks.  She\u2019s been doing this for two and a half years and things have gone well for her.  She enjoys her work because it doesn\u2019t prevent her from being with her daughters and helping them when they need it.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be to buy perfumes, creams, and cosmetics so that she can take advantage of the special offers and sales this month.  She has been part of the communal bank for two years and she likes it because the loans are easy to get.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to provide the best for her daughters.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":939061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-12-09T21:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250774757},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257183126},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263318583},{"amount":206.25,"local_amount":206.25,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":206.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033627}],"funded_date":"2011-12-11T13:19:00Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:26:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Yudy is married and the mother of two children aged 3 and 8, whom she has always wanted to provide with everything they need.\r\n\r\nAs her husband's income is not sufficient to cover their household expenses, Yudy began a business by purchasing a dairy cow which earns her income on a daily basis from the milk that she produces.  Thanks to this, she is able to contribute financially to the household expenses.\r\n\r\nYudy currently has the potential for her customer to purchase more milk than she is able to produce with just one cow, and for this reason she is hoping that a loan will provide her with the possibility of purchasing another dairy cow to increase her milk production capacity and allow her to generate better income.\r\n\r\nYudy hopes in this way that her income will increase considerably, and in this way she can provide her family with a better quality of life.  She also hopes that her children will be able to have access to a better education, and that in future they will have financial stability.  Yudy has the dream of her business providing the possibility of being able to purchase their own home, and in this way being able to provide her husband two children with better opportunities to progress in life."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1006305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a dairy cow to increase her milk production capacity and be able to earn more income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Carmen de Viboral","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yudy Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":56891},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":58491},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":60137},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":61829},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":63568},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":65357},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":67196},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":69086},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":71030},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":73028},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":75083},{"due_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":77196},{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":79367},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":81600},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83896},{"due_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":86257},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":88684},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":91179},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":93744},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":96381}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.24},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.08},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.54},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.88},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":2271,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Rose Igbinoba is 57 years of age with three (3) children.

They have two children who are 12 and 18 years old and both are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nImelda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Imelda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty.

He provides transport services to his passengers within the city. He also provides pick up and drop off services for school children. \r\n\r\nShameem has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband, who wants to repair his rickshaw. His rickshaw is unreliable and doesn\u2019t run for long hours, which is affecting his income. With a fully repaired rickshaw, he will be able to do his work more efficiently and make more money. \r\n\r\nShameem is hopeful that a loan investment will be profitable for her husband and it will result in good profits for him.

She earns her living by operating a fish vending business.  Her husband Quirico, who is 45 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 7 to 21 years old. Rosario joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosario has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 26,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 22,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,000 to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Rosario L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Despite this limitation he is not discouraged; on the contrary, it gives him the incentive to work with greater determination to realize his goal.\r\n\r\nBecause he wants to increase his production, now he has a nursery with four thousand little coffee plants, which he plans to plant at the end of the year and so begin to produce in greater quantities.

She embroiders for a living, an art that she learned thanks to some friends. Over time she has become more creative with her embroidery, and now these friends are very happy to have helped her. She used to sells tamales in the markets, and needed an additional activity to increase her income. Thanks to this art, everyday she receives a good quantity of polo neck sweaters to be embroidered, an activity which she carries out at home. Nevertheless, she continues selling tamales, as she receives orders for different holidays when large quantities of this dish are served to guests.\r\n\r\nAlionza's priority is to install an embroidery workshop, as it is a very profitable business thanks to increasing export orders, and having adequate machinery would help her greatly. She has been a client of MFP for four years, and this is her fifth loan. MFP has helped her to build relationships with people and form part of good team that works responsibly.

Maria has two kids, and both are in school. She has been running a grocery store for six years. It all started because she didn't have a job and needed to feed her family. Maria believes that with a loan, her business can get a little further ahead; she wants to have all the resources necessary for investing in her store.

She is married and a mother, though all her children are already of age and so are no longer in her care nor in their father\u2019s care.  Victorine has been to school through the 5th grade, that is, through primary school.  Then, she learned how to sew, something she has been working at for a few years. \r\n\r\nAlong with sewing, Victorine has been selling various items: candies, cookies, canned foods (milk, sardine, tomatoes), sugar, pasta, soaps for the laundry, dishes, and bath, batteries, candles, etc., and this business has in the end supplanted her sewing.  She has already benefited from four loans with Alid\u00e9 and has repaid them.  She needs funding to diversify her business by selling pub products and fruit juices.

She raises pigs to supplement her husband's income and to make life a little bit more comfortable for their family.\r\n\r\nShe joined NWTF- Project Dungganon in 1991 but stopped in 1999. She rejoined in July of 2006, so that she could get a loan to raise pigs to augment their family income. She buys the piglets, feeds and fattens them for several months and then sells them. This adds PHP 4,000 ($83) to her family's monthly income.\r\n\r\nThe income she earns from raising pigs in her backyard for the last 3 years has helped her family a lot especially with 7 children still going to school. This is why Nieva is committed to continue and expand with this activity so that she could increase her income potential.\r\n\r\nThe PHP 18,000 she is borrowing will allow her to buy more piglets and feed than her previous loan which she ably paid off because of the weekly easy-payment scheme.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

She has been a widow for years and currently lives with her six adult children.\r\n\r\nRemedios owns a general store which has been around for 35 years. She also prepares barbecue and sells it to customers. Remedios makes rags from textile trimmings and sells them to customers. She also finds time to sell cosmetics and apparel through the direct-selling scheme.  From these activities, she could realize a monthly income of $980.  \r\n\r\nShe joined the Kiva field partner, Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative, in 2006.  Her previous loans with the co-op were used to purchase textile trimmings from garment factories.  She used some of the money to buy more items for her store, such as soft drinks.  Now on her tenth loan cycle, Remedios is applying for a new loan amounting to P45,000.00 which she will spread out through all her business activities.\r\n\r\nRemedios would like to see her general store someday grow as big as a commercial grocery chain, so she could help a lot of people by providing quality products at a cheaper price.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":379614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

After finishing school, he started to engage in land cultivating, but it was not very profitable because of the deficiency of cropland. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, in order to find better place to live, Nuraly decided to move to the Chui region in the north of the country. Gaining a wide experience in raising livestock, Nuraly started his business in cattle breeding, which became the main source of income for his family. With initial capital of 10,000 Kyrgyzstan soms (KGS), he managed to earn about 12,000 KGS monthly.  Due to his strong efforts, Nuraly has established his farm and today it has two bull calves and still needs to be developed.  \r\n\r\nNuraly plans to use the loan of 80,000 KGS to broaden his business through buying three bull calves.
