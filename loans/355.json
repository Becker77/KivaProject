She only supports her family.  Gina attended school until the 9th grade, and she stopped when she became pregnant.  Gina lives basically by selling wooden chests which she acquires for 1,500MT in the center of the country and then sells in the city of Maputo for 5,000MT.  With this she has had a monthly income of 30,000MT.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan through Hluvuku and Kiva, but she already had a loan for 12,000MT with the credit association that she applied to a vegetable sales business that did not have good results.  With this loan of 18,000MT she intends to replenish her stocks.  She has future plans to construct a suitable home given that in this moment she lives in a rental.  She also intends to purchase a car, and everything counts on the help of credit.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva

To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Joanne has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP whenever she sells an animal she has raised. Joanne said that it is difficult to have four very young children but she is doing her best to meet their needs. Joanne's family lives in the village of Alibago, Enrile, Cagayan. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Joanne joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. Joanne is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the third loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His father grew vegetables and so he decided to help him grow his crops and learned the trade perfectly.\r\n\r\nJuan started his own business with his father's help.  He has been working for five years for his own family.  His advantage is that the land where he grows his crop is good land.

She is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Sharel owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector: she runs a general store. Although it is not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Sharel has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 750 Samoa talas (WST) a month (approximately $350 USD) from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Sharel joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and for the ability to engage in business activities. Sharel is requesting her first loan of 1000 WST from SPBD, which will be used to purchase additional goods to sell. Sharel plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her

Many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags, or kerosene in order to light them. The fire requires constant fanning to ignite and maintain the flame and makes cooking quite a hot and laborious task. It may not be the easiest or most environmentally friendly form of cooking, but it is the only option many people can afford. Which is good news for Parmo, who requires a loan of $275 in order to add to her stock of mkaa and continue meeting the customer demand.<p>SELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve economic and social emancipation of women.<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro Leasing.

Thi Nguyen, 58 years old, joined the Fund in 2001.  Her family\u2019s situation is very unfortunate; her husband passed away, leaving her to raise their one child by herself.  The child is now grown and live at home with Mrs. Nguyen.  When she first joined the Fund, the family invested in livestock.  In every round of funding the family used the money successfully and brought in a large income.  Currently she is investing the funding in general store run out of her home, and it is truly a business venture that brings strong results with high incomes.  In her town, there are very few people running general stores, so the majority of the townspeople buy goods from her family\u2019s store.  Although her family situation was in a very desperate state, thanks to her perseverance the family\u2019s finances are now very much improved.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

They are on their 5th solidarity loan, after having correctly reimbursed the preceding loans. This new loan will be used to buy 4 bolts of high-quality \"bazin\" (a sort of damask) which will be dyed before being sold, 150 pairs of shoes, 10 dozen perfumes and raw materials for making incense  (5kg of \"magnonkiss\u00e8ni\" and 5kg of \"n\u2019gu\u00e9ni\"--seeds of wild exotic plants--and a case of perfumes). To have good quality incense you soak the \"magnonkiss\u00e8ni\" or the \"n\u2019gu\u00e9ni\" in eau de Cologne for a month or more before using other sorts of perfumes to embellish it. They buy all the raw materials in S\u00e9gou in the big open-air market and sell their wares for cash and retail or for credit out of their homes and walking through the neighborhoods and the big marketplace, to a clientele composed of men and women. <P>\r\n\r\n They expect to make a monthly average profit of 39,000 F CFA which will be used to help their husbands support their families.

He has over ten years of experience as a salesman and two years ago opened his own business. His storefront business sells CDs, records, clothing, and gifts. Gaudencio\u2019s wife and one of his sisters help him run the store. His business attracts the growing Latino population in his community.\r\n\r\nOne of Gaudencio\u2019s greatest challenges is that he doesn\u2019t always have the goods that his customers are looking for. With his second ACCION USA loan, Gaudencio will be able to diversify his inventory by purchasing more clothing and Mexican accessories. This will allow him to retain more customers who come into his store looking for specific items. \r\n\r\nGaudencio has enjoyed being his own boss and generating extra income for his family. He felt the hardships of the economic crisis when no bank would lend to him. Receiving a loan from ACCION USA has allowed him to maintain his business and support his family. Gaudencio hopes to continue growing his business so that his family will be well off some day.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.

Mrs Irma, in order to help her children in school, sells her chickens and turkeys. She gives her earnings to her children so that they can keep studying--so this loan will benefit her family. Mrs Irma has a lot of experience and says that she does not find it difficult to raise the animals, but that it would be difficult to raise other animals such as cows, because she would have to let them out to eat and stay out all day.\r\n\r\nMrs Irma's dream is for her family to be in good health and for her business to advance, and to be able to sell all of her animals, and for her children to finish studying what they want to study.

She is a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRose operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat home-cooked meals during the evening when all  family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Rose's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 400 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Rose is requesting a loan for 16,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRose dreams of giving her her children a high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":980911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The civil war, which took place soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., severely damaged the already-weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in agricultural production and the manufacturing sector.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  All of these factors have resulted in a severe lack of jobs and have forced hundreds of thousands to leave Tajikistan to find work in other countries, mostly in Russia.  While Tajikistan has experienced some economic growth since the end of the Civil War, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON International's mission is to promote sustainable economic development and improved quality of life in Tajikistan by insuring reliable access to financial services for the economically active members of the population. IMON has eight branch offices throughout Tajikistan and their entrepreneurs work in many parts of the country's economic sector including trade, manufacturing, agriculture, and services. As of October 2008, IMON had 27,802 active clients and a total portfolio of $28,405,549.  Approximately 44% of these clients are women and 65% are from rural areas.

Unfortunately, her undergarments sales did not go as expected; so for this new loan she has decided to try a new business.

She has a partner, and lives with her 26-year old daughter and 1-year old grandson. All the adults in the family work; Elida has a butcher's shop that sells poultry. \r\n\r\nShe began the business on her own and doesn't hold daily hours of operation because she has her own chicken farm. Every 6 weeks she has chickens ready for sale. Elida has realized she needs a loan to buy more chickens and chicken feed. She also has a business selling clothing and will invest in the purchase of more clothes.\r\n\r\nThis loan will provide her with the products necessary to meet her customers' demands, so that she can earn more income and improve her family's living standards. Elida hopes to expand her business to become a wholesale poultry distributor.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":580074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase or chickens, chicken feed, and clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Santa Elena, Usulutan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2010-08-08T12:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elida Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":34.52},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":36.14},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":36.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":38.45},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":40.58},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":42.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":43.31},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":44.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":46.19},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":47.81},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":49.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.52},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.14},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.45},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.58},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.78},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.31},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.92},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.19},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.81},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.55,"local_amount":34.55,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":34.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172162962},{"amount":37.28,"local_amount":37.28,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":37.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177458843},{"amount":35.8,"local_amount":35.8,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":35.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182596885},{"amount":39.43,"local_amount":39.43,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T10:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":39.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189181619},{"amount":352.94,"local_amount":352.94,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:55:19Z","rounded_local_amount":352.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191474454}],"funded_date":"2010-08-09T02:36:32Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:55:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":224811,"name":"Yenny","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal  \u201cKUSIKOYLLOR \u201d;  El banco comunal est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Huanchac, provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

This business came to be because her husband earned minimum wage and they were not able to cover the basic expenses and so Barbara partnered with a friend and they established a small business. She said that it was not at all easy and she had to work hard, knocking on doors to sell her dress clothing. She finally managed to save some money and she set up a shop with her partner. Thanks to her effort and dedication she has managed to secure a better income. Her children go to a private school, she has 4 sewing machines for her business, but above all, her family has a better quality of life. Barbara says that she is now saving to purchase an industrial sewing machine. The loan that she was granted will be used to purchase merchandise (fabrics, thread, etc.).

She has also suffered from ill health. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she plans to buy baby pigs, purchase cassava to produce water fufu, and to be able to afford the transportation of her products to the market. She knows her business is going to succeed because she has acquired some basic training on finance management and marketing strategies from GHAPE and also has some form of experience in this business. Manka'a has the skills and other supporting factors for success in her business. The loan, if granted, will enable her to sell in her neighborhood at cheaper rates. She has also taken and successfully repaid loans from GHAPE in the past.\r\n\r\nShe will put her profit back into her business and use part of it to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay children\u2019s hospital bills. Her children\u2019s school needs will be taken care of. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

She is a down to earth and hard-working woman.  She is married to Timoteo who is 52-years-old and they have three school age children and they all live together in their own home.  Paulina has worked very hard since she was 19-years-old.  At that time she worked only in agriculture which only enabled her to maintain her family members.  With the savings she accumulated she opened a grocery store where she offers a variety of staple products.  This is how her stand generates good profits.  She opens the doors of her business very early in the morning to wait for her first buyers.  She mentions that the key to getting better customers is attending to them in a friendly manner and helping them with their purchases.  What she likes best about her work is having a good relationship with her customers.  Now she has been in this business for 10 years and considers the most difficult part to be having to be on her feet all day long.  Her business is going very well and thanks to this she was able to acquire more land to cultivate where her beloved husband works.  With the money from the loan she will buy supplies for her store.  With time, she hopes to expand her house and make her store bigger.  This is her twentieth loan and she is very happy to know that she will have support once more from all of you to continue growing.  In her communal bank she is a member who participates and is very punctual to meetings.  With the money from the loan she will buy merchandise like: sacks of rice, sugar, oils, and detergents.

Once he finished, he realized that working with metal was much faster and easier than wood and therefore more profitable. <\/p>\r\n<p>Today they have four employees (3 of them pictured next to Martha) that work with them and get paid by commission.

Though their village is far from the market and the main municipality, Emeline never allowed these circumstances to hinder her from earning money. She had been selling a variety of cooked food in her neighborhood, even reaching houses farther away in their village. She is used to walking through the rough and narrow road covered with trees to make sure that when she comes back home, she brings money that the children need for school. Neither rain, the heat of the sun, nor tiredness is an excuse for her to stop her from what she has been doing.\r\n\r\nEmeline's family owns a small land that can be used in planting rice. However, this land has not been productive because there was no business capital to start with. The vision of profiting from this kind of business made her join ASHI and take a loan. From then on, her farming business was born and with the help of her family, she tries to maintain it together with her food selling business.\r\n\r\nHaving her family, her own children, and ASHI, Emeline is secure for she can have her own business, which can enable her to send all of her children to college and give them a better life.

She is married and has six adult children.\r\n\r\nFenumiai owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has just started operating this business and earns approximately 650 WST a month.\r\n\r\nFenumiai joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,400 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nFenumiai is now requesting a new loan of 5,150 WST which will again be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be her 6th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is married and has eight children, whose ages range from 12 to 26 years old. She has been a member of the Yoff savings bank - which belongs to the U-IMCEC mutual loan and savings union - since July 2009 and has never taken out a loan. She is known for the sale of \"Diembe\" drums, masks, handcrafted clothing and smoked fish which she exports to Paris. She has been developing her business in this area since 1984. It is above all her husband, a former employee of Air Africa, who encouraged her to take up this activity because he was able to offer her a ticket from time to time. What interests her most in her business is the trips she makes and the profits she earns. She sells mainly to order. She is asking for a loan of 500,000 francs which will be used for the purchase of certain products she has ordered and to give her some pocket money. Thanks to the profits she makes she can cover the costs of her children's schooling. \r\n\r\nAs part of its ongoing vision to participate actively in the battle against poverty, U-IMCEC, with the backing of its lenders, is successfully providing support to people so that they can carry out lucrative revenue generating activities; this in turn contributes to a welcome socio-economic

She is 30 years old and the mother of three daughters and one son. She is married to Willie Boy, a 31-year-old fisherman. She lives in Talim, Binangonan in the province of Rizal, Philippines. She belongs to a poor family that needs help to change their standard of living and she is grateful to ASHI for support, even in all the challenges in life.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her belief and faith in getting out of poverty, Rashelle decided in 2008 to join ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), a micro-finance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with a chance of having start-up capital for generating income. During her previous loan from ASHI, she carefully invested in her sari-sari store (a small retail store selling different goods). The profit is what she uses for daily expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nNow on her fourth loan, Lolita proposes to borrow Php 20,000 to create a broader business. Specifically, the amount will be used to purchase sacks of rice, vegetables, cooking oil, canned goods, and other supplies for her general store. She is very determined and disciplined in using the money which is lent to her. \r\n<p>\r\nRashelle still dreams of the best for her family: to provide the best education for her children and to have a happy family. During her almost two years in ASHI, she has shown herself to be industrious and determined to make her dreams come true. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASHI: Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) has the distinction of being the oldest existing replication of Grameen Bank Approach (GBA) to credit delivery to the bottom poor in the Philippines. With its outstanding achievements over the years, it has become one of the role models in credit delivery to the poor in the country.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":494784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Heng A. and Saei C. all live in Preaek Thom Village in Kandal Province, Cambodia. The six members of this lending group are part of AMK\u2019s Loan Workout Program. All clients have outstanding loans that are delinquent and they are currently unable to pay back the full amount of their existing loan. \r\n\r\nTheir business ventures, which they funded using their existing loan, have failed, putting them in a very unfortunate position. In addition, less work at garment factories and sickness in their families have drastically reduced other sources of income for each family. All six clients will use their loan to start a new business making T-shirts.\r\n\r\nAs part of AMK\u2019s workout program, each client is given a workout loan that will be used to purchase sewing machines, an electricity line and additional sewing equipment. AMK has hired a tailor to train the group to make T-shirts. The material will be provided by AMK to ensure that quality material is used and so that the clients do not have to purchase it themselves. \r\n\r\nAMK has partnered with Ahkun.org to sell their T-shirts online. Fifty percent of all profits will go to this group and the other borrowers in their village who are unable to repay their loan.\r\n\r\nThis program is in contrast to the traditional ways that microfinance institutions deal with delinquent clients:\r\n\u2022\tBy rescheduling the loan and pushing off the problem to another day\r\n\u2022\tRepossessing items that the clients own, including their house or land.\r\n\r\nBecause of AMK\u2019s strong social mission, AMK has created this program to provide an alternative solution to one of microfinance\u2019s dark sides.

Shaloobu is well educated and works as a geography teacher in the school in Kenesh village. She is known for her strong commitment to education. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, teacher salaries in rural areas are very low. For this reason, in 1990, Shaloobu began to breed farm animals using starting capital of 10,000 KGS. She also began to grow potatoes and clover on her farm. Her ongoing efforts to develop the farm led Shaloobu to obtain her first loan from Bai-Tushum and Partners, which was used as intended and repaid without any delays. Now Shaloobu plans to use this loan of 100,000 KGS to buy eleven sheep, three bull calves, and two colts. With the revenues from the loan, she plans to pay for her son's wedding.

She earns her living by operating a bakery and buying and selling dried fish. Her husband Narsiso is 59 years old. They have five children who are 25 to 33 years old. Teresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 26,000 as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future family and business needs. Teresita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

","en":"Robert is 20 years old and single with no children. He lives with his mother in the district of Tambogrande, an agricultural area located in the region of Piura, more than four hours from the city of Chiclayo, the capital of the region of Lambayeque. For three years, Robert has raised pigs. He keeps his animals in corrals located at a relative's house. When they reach a good stage of development he offers them for sale to business people that usually visit the area where he lives. In addition, to generate additional income, he offers passenger transportation services in his mototaxi, a vehicle that comprises a motorcycle and a cab to transport people inside it.

She'll buy at one market and then sell at another, making perhaps US$7 to $13 per day and taking home half of that after travel  expenses and food and the like. With this loan Maria is branching out and buying a calf, hoping that the sale of the calf later will increase her income. She'll buy the calf for about US$200 and hope to sell it later for between US$300 and $400. Maria has three school-aged children, and all are in school. She herself had no schooling at all and cannot read or write. She dreams someday of buying the plot of land  by their house, which would cost about US$7000. Maria's village is nestled right against the side of the Santa Maria volcano, part of a complex of volcanoes that regularly rumbles the area and that completely destroyed the village in the early 20th century. It's a place of beautiful green hillsides and lush plots of corn and vegetables, all divided into little sections called cuerdas. The poorer women often rent just one cuerda and try to grow their own corn for the family and sell some vegetables from it. Those who have more sometimes own two or more cuerdas, and sometimes rent even more. It's hard work, and they always refer to their life as a \"battle\" or \"struggle\", but they continue with the battle to feed their families and keep the kids in school.\r\nWrittten by Randy Fay and

Every day Gusti Kurniati is very busy with all of the work involved in raising her pigs from cleaning their pen to bringing them food.

Unfortunately, the cost of pig feed has gone up.  She makes approximately 10,000,000 selling a pig and after paying for a boar and the pig feed she has about 2,500,000 every 4 months.

Sampai umur 4 bulan biaya pakan diperkirakan akan  menghabiskan Rp.5.000.000,- karena saat ini semua biaya pakan naik. Pendapatan kotor dari penjualan babinya Rp.10.000.000,-.

She and her husband, Mr. Sum San, are farmers who own a small piece of land to cultivate rice to earn a living. In this plantation, they gather a little rice revenue, but not enough to provide a better life to their family. Additionally, their family members also live in an old house in poor conditions; thus, Mrs. Thoeurn S. decided to ask for a loan to add to her savings to build a new house for her family members. She has six children, three of whom are working in a garment factory while the remaining three are attending the local school. Her husband is presented on the right of the photo.

Because of her creativeness in making pots, some of her customers ordered them in bulk so that they could also resell them to neighboring communities.\r\n\r\nLeonita aims to give her family a better and comfortable life.

In the past, she sold mostly non-perishable or semi-perishable foods such as rice, beans, flour and oil \u2013 foods which make up Dominican staples. She is a 33-year-old borrower who lives near San Pedro de Macor\u00eds, Dominican Republic. Maria and the other borrowers in her group live in Los Llanos, a small town to the north of San Pedro. She lives with her husband and three teenage children in a small home made of cement blocks and wooden paneling. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore coming to Esperanza, Maria was unable to find a fair loan. With this, her first loan with Esperanza, she will expand her sales to include fruits and vegetables. In the past, it was not viable for Maria to purchase such perishable items. Now, with an increase in her cash flow, these items will bring in even more profit. She hopes that with the new income from this loan, she will be able to finish the house with cement blocks only. That way, it will be secure from thieves and safer as a shelter during hurricane season. She likes that Esperanza not only gives her a loan, but also creates community, gives lessons, and provides other banking services such as savings. She is now confident that she can send all three of her children to school through university. \r\n<p>\r\nMaria is the coordinator for her group, <i>\u00c9xito con Cristo<\/i> (\"Success with Christ\"), and her story is representative of the other borrowers in the group.

D\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb (20213040006) is a 33-year-old female living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has two school-aged children.  To making a living, T. owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community.  T. has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,500,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,704,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  T. is now requesting a new loan of 7,840,000 VND, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering.  The loan will be the third loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low-income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

She started this business as a result of a high school course in handicrafts that she took several years ago in which she learned how to knit.  She also started making things by hand because her sewing machine broke down.  Margarita is happy to be working with one of her daughters and always learns about creating new models of handbags.  Through the efforts of her daily work, she is able to help her husband since his earnings do not cover everything.  Margarita\u2019s greatest wish is to have a vending post at the market where she can sell her handbags.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Garc\u00eda lives in the San Miguel neighborhood of Copainala, in the state of Chiapas, M\u00e9xico. She has three children, two daughters and one son: Yessenia, Maricela and Juan Dagoberto, all of whom are married and have their own children. \r\n\r\nShe has operated a store for the past 25 years. She comments that with this activity, she has been able to help her family get ahead. Although her store is small, it has given her good results as far as income for her household, and with this, she has also supported her children in finishing their education. \r\n\r\nWhat has motivated her to request the loan from the Realidad Foundation is the need to buy more products and expand her business, and to buy higher-quality products, so that her customers will feel confident about the items they buy from her. She comments that she feels very satisfied with this work, since the store is in a good location, and she is popular among customers for the service she provides. \r\n\r\nWith the earnings she obtains from her business, she will invest in buying more merchandise, so that she will not be limited in the amount she can sell, and with this investment she will obtain better profits, so that she can save and do the best she can for her grandchildren, whom she adores and who are her reason for continuing. \r\n\r\nShe comments that her dream is to build a home for each one of her grandchildren, so that when they grow up, they will already have a place to live; however, the most important thing for her is that all of them finish their studies and have significant achievements in life, and for this reason, they will have her support as long as God grants her life.\r\n\r\nThe group is called \"San Miguel,\" and it is made up of four women. The group has this name because it is the name of the neighborhood where they live. Guadalupe joined the group thanks to her daughter Yessenia, who is the group's representative.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Meet Mercy, a very hardworking, energetic young farmer. Although she has only farmed for the past ten years, she is working hard and learning good farming practices. Through the profits she makes, she has been able to take care of her family and provide the basic needs for her parents.\r\n\r\nMercy lives near Kapomboi in the Kitale area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming. Maize is a very common crop in Kenya and is a staple food for many who regularly eat \"ugali,\" a hard porridge cooked from maize. One can usually buy sifted maize flour in the market, but its cost is high because of the processing. Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly, using a posho mill.\r\n\r\nThe Kapomboi area has only one diesel posho mill (the one Mercy operates) that serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down so farmers cannot grind their maize. Mercy intends to change this by buying another posho mill to serve the area. She will buy an electric, rather than diesel, posho mill, as they are more reliable. Hopefully breakdowns will be few and far between.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, Mercy is applying for a 60,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy a mill. Profits derived from the mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan. In the next two years, Mercy sees herself established and running more than one posho mill. She patiently waits for your
