The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which was ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Gaudens Ayitondji and is the mother of three children, all of whom attend school. Alphonsine also takes care of two other children in addition to her own. For the last four years, Alphonsine has been living with her husband and children in Toweta,  a district of Cotonou (the economic capital of Benin). The couple supports the family together. Alphonsine did not attend school. In order to support herself and her children, she sells baked goods (sweet and savory) in the Sainte Cecile district in Cotonou. Her sideline commercial activity is selling women\u2019s clothes. Alphonsine buys her stock in Cotonou. She has been selling baked goods for about five years. She is a former client of ALID\u00e9 and has previously obtained four loans from them. The four loans obtained earlier have been duly repaid.  This was during the times when Alphonsine was experiencing financial difficulties. In order to bolster her capital and to increase her level of sales, she is seeking a fifth loan from ALID\u00e9. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":449252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing baked goods (sweet and savory)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T16:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alphonsine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":19027.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118020434},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":19027.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858927},{"amount":85,"local_amount":36000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-27T23:22:29Z","rounded_local_amount":38055.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130495093},{"amount":42.74,"local_amount":18100,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":19133.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136619073},{"amount":42.26,"local_amount":17900,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":18921.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575560},{"amount":138.28,"local_amount":58565,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":61908.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166953989},{"amount":31.72,"local_amount":13435,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":14201.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347247}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T18:38:24Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T12:30:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":166531,"name":"Yan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Yan K., age 52, and her husband, Mr. At Vat, age 57, have been married since 1979 and have five sons and two daughters.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":693940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Calamba Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jailyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1150,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50922,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221679240}],"funded_date":"2011-02-04T11:45:02Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:54:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":269549,"name":"Reynaldo Al\u00ed","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Reynaldo H. es originario del municipio de Achuapa, se dedica a laborar como operador de Pozo para ENACAL en dicho municipio desde hace seis a\u00f1os.

Here he formed his family with Eugenia, his wife of 8 years. They have 2 children: Carlos and Carla, who they are educating and raising in their own house. \r\n\r\nWhen he was young, Carlos learned all he needed to know about the earth and how to make it produce. It was then that little by little, with the passage of time, he was placed in charge of his parents' lands. Now, he has extensive cultivated fields, in which he grows coffee, plantains, and avocados, which he sells in the city markets at La Merced.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes most about his work is cultivating the earth, because it is the activity that offers sustenance for his family. He has been at this for 12 years and the most difficult part is protecting his crops from plagues of insects. But constant work and dedication has resulted in each coffee harvest resulting in good earnings, and the local buyers know him as a hard-working and reliable person.\r\n\r\nAlso, Carlos doesn't forget the noble sacrifice of his wife who works as an educational promoter in the capital of the country, where she teaches children to read and write. Constantly, she travels to see her family without neglecting her work; that's motivates him with much determination, to buy a car for transporting his products.\r\n\r\nCarlos belongs to the \u201cAroma de Cafe\u201d (Aroma of Coffee) communal bank and this is his 4th loan through MFP, whose collaboration he awaits in order to achieve his objectives. And he promises once again to make his payments, as with his previous loans. Carlos  is pleased to be a part of his communal bank, because all the members are responsible people with much solidarity. Carlos will invest the money in buying various sacks of organic manure to spread around his coffee trees, which within months will be harvested."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":789957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"buy various sacks of organic manure to spread around his coffee trees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-14T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1518.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621344}],"funded_date":"2011-06-15T14:48:41Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":310530,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is 30 years old and lives in the Philippines.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":320376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy charcoal in bulk for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T19:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":301837.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773302}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T00:56:06Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":113015,"name":"Pabla Petrona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pabla Petrona G\u00f3mez tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene 2 hijos y la actividad econ\u00f3mica a la que ella esta dedicada es a la venta de mercader\u00eda en general, ella se inicia en este rubro siendo una madre abandonada pero que con mucho valor decidi\u00f3 enfrentar su situaci\u00f3n e invirti\u00f3 unos ahorros que tenia en la compra de mercader\u00eda, de esta manera pudo hacer clientela quienes le compraban al contado y al cr\u00e9dito, al principio fue un poco dif\u00edcil, pues sus ni\u00f1os estaban peque\u00f1os y ella no tenia clientes fijos por lo que tenia que caminar largos trechos para conseguirlos.

R. es un  se\u00f1or de 44  a\u00f1os de edad quien vive con su esposa en una comunidad llamada El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nComo parte de las respuestas a esa situaci\u00f3n, desde hace dos a\u00f1os se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos, propiedad de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce, hecho que motiv\u00f3 a don German a iniciar en la producci\u00f3n de leche para luego venderla a esta planta. \n\nAsegura que su familia  se ha dedicado a esta actividad durante mucho tiempo, por lo que ha podido experimentar todos los cuidados que demanda, adem\u00e1s de la instrucci\u00f3n recibida por parte de sus familiares  a lo largo del tiempo. \n\nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive don German es famoso en todo Costa Rica. Es un queso fresco que se le conoce tradicionalmente como \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d. A los \u201cticos\u201d (como se les conoce a los habitantes de Costa Rica) les gusta mucho consumir este producto; se le encontrar\u00e1 en las mesas acompa\u00f1ando cualquier tipo de comida.  Por esta raz\u00f3n, el mercado para dicho producto es realmente bueno.\n\nDon German desea obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito de \u00a2500,000 (quinientos mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera y poder iniciar con su negocio ya que desea ser un microempresario exitoso y  as\u00ed poder ayudar a que su familia siga adelante esto es una de las cosas que lo motiva a esforzarse y trabajar con mucho esmero.\n\nDon German es socio de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una de las 100 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica. Este ser\u00e1 su primer pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico. Tambi\u00e9n destaca que gracias a este tipo de organizaciones y medios facilitadores de cr\u00e9dito puede dedicar m\u00e1s tiempo a las actividades productivas. \n","en":"German M. R. is 44 and lives with his wife in a community called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba in the province of Cartago.  This is a small rural community of approximately 2,000 people.  Its residents are dedicated to milk production and to growing coffee.  It has an irregular landscape, and much of the land is maintained as tropical forests.  The community has very picturesque landscapes that combine the tropical forest with lovely lakes, coffee plantations, and dairy farms.  El Sauce is located approximately an hour and a half from Turrialba, the nearest commercial center.  However, several times a year, the road becomes impassable due to the rains that slam the region.  This is without a doubt one of the biggest challenges for the community.\r\n\r\nWhen there weren't a lot of jobs in the area, many people opted to go out looking for work in Turrialba or at banana farms located in the Atlantic region of Costa Rica.  Currently the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so neighbors are looking to invest in projects in this region to avoid having to migrate to find work. \r\n\r\nAs part of the answer to this situation, two years ago, a cheese factory was built in the community.  It belongs to El Sauce's Association of Milk Producers.  This has motivated German to start producing milk to sell to this plant.\r\n\r\nHe assures us that his family has been dedicated to this work for a long time, which is why he has been able to experiment with all of the work that it demands.  He has also received training from his family members for a long time now.  \r\n\r\nThe cheese that comes from the region where German lives is famous throughout Costa Rica.  It's a fresh cheese that is traditionally knowh as \"Turrialba cheese.\"  \"Ticos\" (the name given to people from Costa Rica) like this product a lot, and it can be found on tables accompanied by any type of food.  For this reason, the market for this product is very good.\r\n\r\nGerman hopes to obtain a microcredit of 500,000 colones to buy a dairy cow and to be able to start his business.  He hopes to be a successful microbusinessman and to be able to help his family get ahea.  This is one of the things that motivates him to work very hard and very carefully.\r\n\r\nGerman is a member of the Producers Association of El Sauce, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his first loan, and he hopes to continue growing at a personal and economic level.  He also stresses that he is thankful to this type of organization and easier ways to access credit so he can dedicate more time to productive activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

Kebbeh sells in the Bokeza market in a stall alongside other vendors.  She has been running her business for 3 years.  Today her business is only open when she has inventory, even though the demand is constant.  She\u2019s taking a loan to increase her inventory sufficiently so she can keep her business open year-round.  She treats her customers so well that she believes they will come to her year-round from adjacent villages.  With the profits she will invest in the future of her kids, especially in education since she was unable to attend school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":380323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing palm oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Lofa Co.

They have seven children who are 6 to  16 years old. \r\n\r\nLuzminda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luzminda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to buy more fishing gear and additional hogs to raise so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children and support the family. Luzminda A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married and has two children, aged 16 and 7. In 2009, she established a vegetable farming business. Working seven days a week and eight hours a day, she supoorts her family. She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer for her farm.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Sita plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. Over 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer. With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner, MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW was Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to its clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Meet Lydia a simple country woman aged 26. She comes from a very hardworking family who works the land to earn their living. Thanks to the knowledge they have passed on to him, Lydia today raises and sells cows. She starts work in the early hours of the morning (5 a.m.) caring for and feeding the animals. She is the proud owner of a small parcel of land, on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past six years. Her primary sources of income are selling eggs and milk, and through this venture she has earned a decent income. She also engages in personal business in order to make ends meet(motorcycle business). Lydia passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cows. Although this humble mum has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. Lydia is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. With the loan capital, she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day. This will help to fully satisfy the demand. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is a field partner, she attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills. This will help her save more money in order to repay the loan fully and to improve her living conditions.\nLydia says that her main goal during this festive season is to watch over her family's well-being, be self-sustaining, and generate more profit from her business so that she can give her family a better quality of life.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2046800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2208.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2272.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2339.06},{"due_date":"2016-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2407.42},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2477.78},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2550.19},{"due_date":"2016-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2624.72},{"due_date":"2016-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2701.43},{"due_date":"2016-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2780.38},{"due_date":"2016-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2861.67},{"due_date":"2016-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2945.26},{"due_date":"2016-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3031.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.37},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.34},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.96},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":2415,"name":"Johanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>For about 8 months Johanna has been selling clothing from a catalogue.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, which enables them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":320422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase clothes in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T20:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tusajigwe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":503062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868017}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T23:18:38Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":113031,"name":"Socos Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Socos, el Banco inicia su tercer ciclo con 18 socias.

The members come from the Socos district.  The members all have different jobs, such as grocery sales, food sales, clothing sales, small animal sales, and agriculture sales.\r\n\r\nTake the case of Elva, for example, who is 30 years old and separated with 2 children.  Elva sells basic grains in the city of Pisco, where she travels weekly.  She purchases the grains in her district.  In addition, Elva also grows potatoes and peas.\r\n\r\nFlorentina is 28 years old and married with 3 children.  Florentina and her family have a weaving workshop, where they make items such as rugs, which they sell in the city's artesanal market.\r\n\t\r\nThe bank members need different loan amounts, such as 300, 600, and 900 Soles, combining for a grand total of 13,000 Soles for the Communal Bank.  The money will be invested in the purchase of peas, wool, rice, noodles, sugar, wheat, and small animals.  The members' dreams are that their children can complete their studies, to purchase a car to transport their products, and to construct a house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Lucas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":329346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase peas, wool, rice, noodles, sugar, wheat, and small animals.

She is 56 years old. Erlinda is married and has six adult children. Erlinda operates a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Erlinda has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos (about $104) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Erlinda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Erlinda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Ismael manages day-to-day operations of the business, with his wife handling business finances.  In addition to the two of them, there is also a part-time driver who helps when needed.  \r\nIsmael describes his business as a \u201cdo-it-all\u201d outfit because of its diverse clients and the wide array of services it provides.  The business originally began as a hauling service, and Ismael would set up contracts with companies or individuals that needed material removed from a site.  Ismael had one truck with which he did all the hauling, and he grew his business by word of mouth.  \r\n\r\nA few years ago, Ismael was able to purchase a backhoe, expanding the work his business could do.  The backhoe lets him to dig ditches for electrical lines, clear away trees and brush, break up concrete and excavate for houses, just to name a few of its uses.  For the competive industry in which Ismael operates, possesing such capabilities makes his business more attractive to clients.\r\n\r\nIsmael is using the money from this loan to meet pressing business expenses.  He does not take any upfront payment for work he does, because of the negative image it would portray to customers.  He believes it builds respectability for his business when he waits to collect payment until a job\u2019s completion.  This loan will allow him to buy materials needed for jobs, as well as help him with meeting other pressing operational costs such as payroll.  Business has been slow over the past few months due to the economy and inclement winter weather (when it rains, work grinds to a halt until the ground dries).  All of this puts pressure on cash flow, and affects Ismael\u2019s ability to take on new business.  Ismael says were it not for this loan, he would have had to sell some of his equipment.\r\n\r\nIsmael and his wife have 5 children, the latest of which are 18 month old twin boys.  Despite all the work that comes with maintaining and growing a small business, Ismael and his wife make family a priority.  They enjoy helping the kids with their schoolwork, and encourage their children to be active in extracurricular activities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4525,"image":{"id":713370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Materials for already undertaken projects, payroll and other operational expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Antonio, Texas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2011-02-16T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4525,"lender_count":148,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ismael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4524.69,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":4525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":330.48},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":357.9},{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":363.84},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":366.8},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":372.55},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":375.9},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":380.53},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":386},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":389.97},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":395.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":399.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":404.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.93},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":363.86},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":372.57},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375.93},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380.55},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":386.03},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":390},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395.27},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":399.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404.6},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":4525,"local_amount":4524.69,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:54:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201207803}],"funded_date":"2011-02-21T01:01:17Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T09:54:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":277776,"name":"Luy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luy V., 41, resides with her family in Takeo Province, Cambodia, an area known for its pre-Angkorean temples.

farming for ten years now. His farm produces maize, tea, milk, and vegetables, but mostly eggs which he sells to the local market.

As a single woman, Lorena thinks that the most important thing is to think about her future and that of her family. This is why three years ago, she bought a small plot of land where she grows plantains, corn and coffee. She then sells it to buyers that visit the indigenous community on the weekends.\r\n\r\nWhat she loves most about her job is planting, working the small farm, and the unconditional help she gets from her brother, Frank. \u201cThis is my incentive to come out ahead,\u201d she mentions.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":256924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more cloth for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T18:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130719},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130720},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027511},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613512},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010591}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T19:52:01Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":88471,"name":"Sorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Sorn L., 51, and his wife, Mrs. Yat Cheng, 48, who live in a small village in the suburbs of Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia, married in 1980 and have four children: one son and three daughters.

two children.  She is 37 years old, and went into business several years ago when her family income started to drop, and work on the collective farm could no longer cover all the family expenses. The children were growing and so she decided to find another source of income.  When Robiyahon started to trade at the market, she had very little working capital.  The gradual reinvestment of a portion of her profits into the company yielded even bigger profits. Also, not long ago her younger brother began to help her, and now he and his family are part of the business as well.

This is 30-year-old Joyce K. from Mbeya . She is married with four children between the ages of 2 and 10.\r\n\r\nJoyce has been running a genge business since 2008. A genge (grocery store) is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to, to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nJoyce works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week and currently earns about $120 a month. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase items in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to open a new business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":320458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase items in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":900000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":901462.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773314}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T19:39:19Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":113047,"name":"Samfien","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A. is married to two wives and has six children.

Vasati has successfully repaid a previous loan of $1600 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Vasati is now requesting a new loan of $2200 WST, which will be used to purchase a transport vehicle to improve the business.  The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Vasati from SPBD.  Vasati plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The street where she lives isn't paved yet.  Four years ago Lorena began selling Yanbal (a brand of catalogue cosmetics) thanks to a girlfriend who encouraged her to do so in order to have a source of income for her family.  She works from 2pm until 6pm selling cosmetics and perfumes.  She buys $280 worth of cosmetics per month and she sells them for $400 per month.  Her 16-year-old daughter helps her sell.

They have four children, a 29-year-old, a 24-year-old, a 19-year-old and their youngest daughter, 16, who is in public secondary school.

She lives with her husband in a nuclear family in the Somono district of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Mainouna left school in the third grade of elementary school (according to the Mali education system) in order to set up a small business at her mother's to sell sweetmeats. After several years' apprenticeship with her mother in order to master the mechanics of business, she ended up developing her own business selling millet and rice, which she has been carrying out now for seven years. She benefits from a large customer base and carries out her business on the market of Somono in the town of S\u00e9gou.\r\n\r\nWith the aim of increasing her working capital in order to make more profit, she resorted to Soro Yiriwaso. She has been in relations with this company for the past 48 months. After four group loans and two individual loans which have all been paid without incident, she is now on her third individual loan which she plans to use to buy 800kg of rice. She gets her supplies in the Office zone of Nigeria, more precisely in Dougabougou and S\u00e9ribala. \r\n\r\nMrs. Mainouna T. generally sells for cash to a customer base made up of both women and men. With this loan she expects to make a monthly profit of 75,000 FCFA. This profit will allow her to help her husband and to contribute to social events (baptisms, marriages etc.). Her ambition is to have a piece of land to live on. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

Meet Everlyne, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Kitale area of Kenya. Everlyne, 30, has been farming for the past 10 years. Through those years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Everlyne is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. She is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Kitale area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Everlyne could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Everlyne, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Everlyne believes that this loan will be of great help to her. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Everlyne to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children.\nShe hopes to be able to make progress as a smallholder farmer and to have a more stable income.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2046874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":2447,"name":"Geoconda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Geoconda is a seamstress who makes sheets and clothing.

C. is 46 years old and single. She has four children, two of whom are married. Her two younger children, both boys, are 18 and 13 years old. Her older son is finishing high school, where he studies Computer Science, and her younger son is a freshman in high school. Her partner, who she lives with, is a mechanic and sells bicycle parts to help support the family. For the past four years, Mrs. A. C. has owned a small local store located at Kilometer 104 of the Leon Chinandega highway, which is better known as Telica. This is her second source of income: she is a schoolteacher, but does not earn very much since her teacher's salary is so low. Since her partner doesn't earn very much as a mechanic, either, she decided to open the store to better support her children. \r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to inject more capital into her small store to offer a wider variety of merchandise for household consumption and to grow the store into one of the biggest in the area. With this loan, she plans to expand and strengthen her inventory by buying rice, sugar, oil, soda, detergent, cosmetics, chicken, eggs, milk and other products. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":210099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy rice, sugar, oil, etc. for local store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Telica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-10-06T18:20:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicita Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T04:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5316705},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9935064},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858560},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399820},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091803},{"amount":56.24,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985213},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445823},{"amount":281.26,"local_amount":5416.69,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5575.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956479}],"funded_date":"2008-10-06T19:57:52Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":72103,"name":"Anwar's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anwar baji is the wife of M. and lives in a city named Arifwala, Pakistan.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"\u201cAssociation Femme D\u00e9veloppement Entreprise AFDE Num\u00e9ro 15\u201d is composed of five women who average 38 years of age and who live in large traditional extended families in the Grand Thi\u00e8s district in the city of Thi\u00e8s, located 70 km from Dakar, the capital of Senegal.  They know one another through ties of community and kinship.  Some of them do food catering, and some sell cloth.  They learned how to cook when they were young, so they are very experience and in high demand in these businesses.  Women\u2019s clothing in West Africa is an essential part of the culture, and all women wear very colorful clothing.  Commerce in fabrics therefore does well.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith regard to improving the quality of their services and expanding their businesses, the members of this reliance group decided to join the micro-finance institution IMCEC.  They received a group loan before from IMCEC, and they indeed repaid it. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members plan to use this loan to replenish their stock of cloth and to bolster their restaurant business, accepting cash at the Grand Thi\u00e8s marketplace.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members hope to realize an average profit of 30,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The profits will be used to make loan interest payments, to provide for family needs, and to invest the rest in business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":301185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy cloth and to strengthen their restaurant business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2009-04-09T23:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Codou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nogaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokhaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Codou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T19:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44636070},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T04:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53037980},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T20:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63262084},{"amount":128.09,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T23:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73703068},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T05:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87132654},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T08:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97046923},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:18:01Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103892472},{"amount":128.16,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110780980}],"funded_date":"2009-04-11T14:34:21Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T17:57:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":104871,"name":"Eudosia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eudosia es socia del Banco Comunal Soluci\u00f3n.\nEudosia es conviviente, tiene 49 a\u00f1os y 1 hijo, Eudosia tiene una tienda en su casa en donde vende abarrotes en general actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas con la ayuda de su hija.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":320505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase items in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T23:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olesta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":900000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":901462.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773319}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T17:40:25Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":113063,"name":"Las Productoras De Patahuasi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The members of the communal bank \u201cProductoras D.

He lives in a traditional extended family with several other families in the Darsalam neighborhood in S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\n\nMamadou abandoned his studies in the third grade of basic school (Malian educational system) for personal reasons. He then started to learn the tailoring trade alongside his uncle for three years.\n\nAfter this stage of his apprenticeship, during which he learned a great deal, he decided to branch out on his own; that was fourteen years ago now. He has a great reputation due to his genius for creating unique items.  In addition to his tailoring business, Mamadou Kon\u00e9 also occasionally sells grain.\n\nIn an effort to improve his business, he has turned to the loan program offered by the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso. This is Mamadou's first individual loan, with which he intends to buy two 20U sewing machines.  He buys his supplies locally in S\u00e9gou. He makes the clothes and sells them for cash or credit to both men and women.\n\nWith this loan he hopes to generate a monthly income of 100,000 FCFA, which will allow him to take care of his expenses (e.g., food, clothing) and provide for the needs of his workshop.\n\nHis ambition is to get into commercial grain storage in S\u00e9gou.\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent,

Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP, which was also funded by Kiva lenders, was used to fund the operations of her eatery and general store business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is taking out her 16th loan, in the amount of 23,000 PHP, which she intends to use on her business.

Miriam is requesting a loan to buy ingredients like wheat, oil, eggs, yeast, and cinnamon, to bake bread. She also wishes to buy chickens to dress and sell in her community.  This so she can obtain income and advance her family.\r\n\r\nShe was motivated to carry out this activity to help her husband earning household income and, together, to make a contribution to their advancement, each one giving the best they could with their own activity. With the earnings obtained from her two businesses, she can buy all the necessities and not see herself limited in either of her activities, and she can have better income each day.

She is 29 years old. Marilyn is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Guava.\r\n\r\nMarilyn is married and has 2 school-aged children. She owns and operates a specialized retail store, selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, instant noddles, canned goods, coffee, milk, and toothpaste in the local community. Marilyn has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,200 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marilyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and increase working capital. Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Marilyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Monthly, Salvacion earns approximately Php 9,500.\r\n\r\nTo help her advance her business, Salvacion is applying for a loan amounting to Php 19,000. She will buy more quick-selling items such as toiletries, canned goods, and instant noodles to add to her inventory of products. She sees this as a sure way to increase her profits over time.\r\n\r\nSalvacion simply dreams of getting away from poverty and giving her family a prosperous life. She desires that as her business grows with the application of every entrepreneurial skill and the spiritual support CCT gives her, every member of her family will experience not only happiness, but joy that transcends all circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has been in this business for the last three months and says that it is profitable. The major challenge Alice faces is financial constraints.

Besides saving man-power, it's also more efficient. We can raise Kereman cows faster so that we can sell it in 4 to 6 months. Therefore, I Nyoman Kartikayasa used the loan from Dinari to buy 1 cow (2-3 years old) which cost Rp. 3,500,000 (about $386). The rest of the loan was used to cover the cow's food expense. I Nyoman Kartikayasa feeds the cow twice a day in the morning and in the evening. The basic food is processed food made from the mixture of rice chaff, corn and ground soyabean dregs. The estimated cow's food per kg is Rp. 1,500 (about $0.16) (Rp.1,500 x 120 days = Rp. 180,000 -- about $20). This processed cow's food is given every morning. In the afternoon, he feeds the cow with natural food such as grass, jackfruit leaves, and cocoa skin which contained good protein for cow. When the harvest time comes, the cow's weight was 415 kg and its price is Rp. 15,000 (about $1.65) per kg. Hence, the net income (after subtracted with the initial capital and cow's food expense) was Rp. 2,545,000 (about $281). I Nyoman Kartikayasa is very pleased with this business. He hopes to get more loans from Dinari so that he can raise more cows. He can use the income to cover his family's daily expenses.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDi Kabupaten Jembrana, Bali Barat,  pemeliharaan sapi Kereman ( sapi yang dikandangkan ) sangat diminati oleh masyarakat . Selain menghemat tenaga, juga lebih efisien. Dengan adanya sapi kereman yang pemeliharaannya cepat, jangka waktu 4 - 6 bulan sudah siap untuk dijual. Oleh sebab itu lewat Dinari, I Nyoman Kartikayasa memperoleh modal pinjaman Modal ini dipergunakan untuk membeli 1 ekor sapi yang sudah cukup besar ( umur 2 \u2013 3 tahun ) dengan harga Rp. 3.500.000,-. Sisanya dipakai untuk biaya pakan.. Sapi kereman I Nyoman Kartikayasa diberi makan 2 kali setiap pagi dan sore hari. Makanan pokoknya makanan olahan ( konsentrat ) yang terbuat dari dedak padi yang kasar, jagung, ampas kedelai yang dihaluskan kemudian dicampur menjadi satu. Perkiraan harga pakan per kilogram adalah Rp.1.500,- ( Rp. 1.500.- X 120 hari = Rp. 180.000.- )\r\nPakan olahan diberikan pada pagi hari dan untuk siang hari diberi makanan alami sebagai makanan tambahan seperti rumput, daun nangka dan kulit coklat ( kakao ) yang proteinnya bagus untuk sapi. \r\nPada saat panen berat sapi I Nyoman Kartikayasa 415 kg dengan harga per kg Rp.15,000,-. Jadi pendapatan bersih setelah dipotong modal sapi dan pakan yang menjadi Rp. 2.545.000,- selama empat bulan. I Nyoman Kartikayasa sangat senang dengan usahanya ini . Harapannya supaya pinjaman dari Dinari bisa meningkat agar bisa pelihara lebih dari 1 ekor. Dengan keuntungan ini bisa dipakai untuk keperluan rumah tangganya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":80277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Vivian plans to invest her loan in her already existing provision. She will divide her loan between articles such as rice, savon, sugar, magi, palm oil and transportation costs.  She plans to contribute 50,000 CFA (approximately $100 USD) of her own savings towards her business plans.  \r\n \r\nThis is Vivian\u2019s second loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2007.  From her past experience, her articles are in high demand in her area and she can sell it quite quickly with fast turnover.  Bringing palm oil and other articles from the main market to her community will reduce the transportation costs of her clients as they will be able to purchase these items nearby.  She is confident that this loan will allow her to provide more products and therefore sell more as she will buy in bulk.  \r\n \r\nWith the profits from this loan, Vivian hopes to expand her business.  She also plans to support her children, improve their education, and improve her family\u2019s living standards.  She knows she will not have a problem with her repayments because her loan schedule is set up so that her payments are small and regular.  \r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":320550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase crops in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-17T00:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Queen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":701137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773322}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T06:56:14Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":113079,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anita J. is from the town of Lopez Jaena.
