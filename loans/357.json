She is 44 years old, is married and has six children between 3 and 27 years old. Three of the children go to school. Maria finished second grade but did not have time to finish school because her father made her spend most of her time working on their farm. She lives in her own house.\r\n\r\nShe began a small business selling turnovers at the corners by the school, but with her husband's help she was able to get a stand at the Central Market where she sells basic goods like tomatoes, onions, carrots and rice. She has spent an average of 8,000 meticais on her purchases and has a profit of 3,000 meticais, which she uses for household expenses and construction. Maria also sells meals (soups) daily and earns 350 meticais. She also relies on her husband's help.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with Hluvuku. She is asking for 10,000 meticais to increase her inventory. The earlier loans were for 5,000 meticais and 15,000 meticais and were used for her business. She paid them off successfully and is confident that she will do the same on this loan so she can get more loans, as she would really like to help her daughter, who is currently unemployed."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":834901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

F. is a 31-year-old woman living in the town of Matautu Uta Lefaga.  She is married and has five school-aged children.  The main source of income from her crop-raising business comes from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Asoiva has been engaged in this business for over three years.\r\n\r\nAsoiva joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Asoiva has successfully repaid a previous loan from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Asoiva is now requesting a new loan of $375 which will be used to purchase more harvesting equipment.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Asoiva plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

They hope to earn an average monthly profit of 62,700 FCFA, which they will use to pay the interest on their loans, cover the expenses for their families' needs and they will invest the rest in their businesses. \r\n\r\nPlease note: In the photo their are only 5 women, as the sixth member of the group (called Awa C.) had gone to the hospital with one of her children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Margot Bonner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":450290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase peanuts, beans and clothes for re-sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tedi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Solo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-23T10:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":150482.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152468},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":75241.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991307},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-18T08:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":75241.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021582},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":75241.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746372},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":75241.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778913}],"funded_date":"2010-01-01T20:16:14Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Margot Bonner","image":645826}},{"id":167016,"name":"Kahengye Group, Rukungiri","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

Nowadays she lives with her small 4 year old son.  She works in agriculture, as passed on to her by her parents.  She grows potatoes and then sells them.  Her mother is a big support in all that she does and is always there to help her.  It's because of this that she is able to work in the fields.  During planting season and also during harvesting her mother is always there to help.  While she waits for the harvest, she has another business, which is selling used clothing in the city of Tacna.  She returns periodically to watch over her crops.

They live in a flood prone area in a former private hacienda. She is married to Mauricio and has four children: Virgilio\u2013 23 years old, an elementary graduate; Belinda\u2013 20 years old, a high school graduate; Estelita\u2013 19 years old, also a high school graduate and working as a domestic helper; and Marvin\u2013 15 years old, a high school undergraduate. Due to the lack of financial resources, they were not able to provide their children with higher levels of education and because some of her children lack the interest to study. \r\n\r\nFor 15 years, Leticia was able to maintain her village store through the help of her husband and the financial support of a microfinance institution. She hopes to engage in another type of business in the future and to be able to support her husband in his farming needs since they no longer have children to send to school. She knows that she must work hard in order to achieve her business plan someday and to avoid asking for credit from traders that offer large interests. With this, Leticia would like to borrow a loan of PHP 7,000 that she will invest for her store and farming needs.

It is a large neighborhood on the northern limit of Santo Domingo. The brand new Santo Domingo Metro (subway train) has a station right at the entrance of Guaricanos; however, modern improvements haven't reached many of our borrowers' homes. All services, especially water, are scarce. Finding employment is difficult, which is why many people, especially single mothers like Nereida P., find that they need to put their skills to work in order to support their families. Nereida is thirty-six years old and has two children. She didn't complete middle school, but went to beauty school and received a certificate in beauty culture. She set up a salon where she works alone. Peak days are Saturdays and Sundays. She explains that things are not easy lately. \"People come less often than before,\" she points out. Even so, she's been able to build a faithful clientele that will still come to get their hair done at least once a week. Nereida knows they pay not only for the service, they also pay to have HER provide the service. She will use this loan to buy specific hair products so that she can offer \"special services\" to her customers. When you wash hair with brand name products you can charge more, and Dominican women are willing to pay well to have their hair well taken care of.

This region is more than four hours from the city of Chiclayo which is the capital of the region of Lambayeque.\r\n<p>\r\nShe sells cosmetics from a catalog and works by request.  Her customers are her neighbors and acquaintances but she is always in search of new clients since the more orders she has, the more she earns from the company that provides her with the products.

He loves this business because, as he says, this serves as source of income of the family aside from farming.\r\n\r\nMost of Jerry's profits in the hog raising business has been invested in agricultural land that they are now planting with rice. Jerry still wants to expand his business. He is requesting a loan of PHP40,000 to buy two additional piglets and feed for the maintenance of his hogs. He hopes to gain higher income again for the future of his family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":897874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy two additional piglets and feed for the maintenance of his hogs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"San Bonifacio, Burgos, Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2011-11-03T01:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jerry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":427.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":18469.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250705326},{"amount":522.5,"local_amount":22000,"processed_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":22574.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263495035}],"funded_date":"2011-11-03T10:22:52Z","paid_date":"2012-03-16T07:41:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":352043,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a 32 year old married woman who has four children, three of whom are in school.

J. is married and has three minor children. She specializes in selling rice. Rice is the most important Tajiks food product, because it is used to prepare Tajiks plov (pilaf). To buy goods, Ochahon goes to a wholesale market that is held once a week in neighboring Kyrgyzstan. Ochahon then sells rice all the week in the central market.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Olo, 43 years old, and together they have two children, Yessenia, who is 12, and Jonathan, who is 4.  This beautiful family lives in a humble and cozy home which they own.   Rosa has a disability in her legs, but this does not discourage her, nor is she afraid of the hard work that comes with farming.  When she can't work she feels useless.   So her husband, and her oldest daughter help her with her business raising donkeys and cultivating potatoes and other crops which are in high demand.   The income she generates is enviable, and you only have to listen to her to feel that anything is possible.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>    What she likes most about living in the sierras and cultivating squash is that when they are ripe, she can prepare delicious sweets.  Rosa says that her children are good students, so she prays for strength to continue working so that she can pay for their education.   In the future, she plans to plant in greater quantity, and with the income she would like buy a house in the city and set up a small general store.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> This is the 6th loan with MFP.

With the loan that she is applying for, she plans to buy twenty sacks of fertilizers and a thousand banana plants, with which she will be able to renovate her cultivations, and also be able to contract workers to help with the process.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy Quan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":522184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a thousand banana plants, twenty sacks of fertilizer, and contract workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-10T11:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2055.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886314}],"funded_date":"2010-04-10T14:29:00Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracy Quan","image":null}},{"id":196311,"name":"Rathnawathi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rathnawathi is a 50-year-old married woman living with her husband in the town of Hikkaduwa, in southern Sri Lanka.

His oldest son currently attends university, and his three teenaged children attend a local secondary school. His wife makes traditional Mongolian boots and sells them to supplement her family's income. He operates a small wooden products production business in his area. Baatarbold started his wood products business in 2001. He received a loan from Xacbank in 2008, and spent it to purchase a saw machine and started to produce home furniture. He has used the success of his business earnings to greatly improve his quality of life. His earnings have also enabled him to pay for his children's tuition fees and school supplies for his children. For the future, Baatarbold hopes to purchase new tools to help him to improve his product quality and to increase the variety of wood products. He is requesting an 800,000 MNT loan to buy a new machine and raw materials for his business.

She lives in her parent's house along with her husband Alonso, 43, and her 4 beloved children, who are the main motivation for all of her efforts.  For her, raising livestock is an activity that she has been learning throughout her life.  From the time that she was very young she learned this trade from her parents, who worked hard to give her a good life.  She takes her animals to sell in the livestock market in the city of Tarma.  There she gets good prices, since her cows are the biggest and strongest in the whole market as a result of the care that she gives them.  \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this type of work for 26 years, and what she likes most is feeding the animals.  In the future, she hopes to increase the number of cows that she has and in this way increase her income.  What she considers most difficult is transporting her livestock to the market, since this is very tiring, but she knows she has to do it and she is ready to work very hard to reach her goals.  This is her 4th loan with MFP, and she has a strong desire to make her payments on time, just as she did with her previous loans.  She is a cheerful and well-liked member of her communal bank, and she hopes to continue to work well with all of the other members.

For 7 years, she has lived with her partner and father of her 2 children.  Currently they live in a rented house.  For 12 years, she has produced potatoes, peas, and corn, mostly on rented plots of land.  She trieds to plant in different places with diverse temperatures so her harvests can alternate.  Her husband is in charge of carrying out the most difficult work; above all his presence during the harvest season is indispensable.  Her potato harvest has yielded very good results thanks to the good market price, but corn is in a bad period because the prices have dropped a lot.  This is why she has decided to postpone its harvest until the prices improve.  This is why she is preparing 2 plots of land to plant peas.  She will plant them in different stages to avoid having all of her production earn less money if prices fall.  Hilda is very happy with being a farmer because this work allows them to support their family.  She is the secretary of her communal bank, and she has had this position for two consecutive cycles.  She is working with a lot of efficiency.  This is her eighth loan with MFP.  During this time she has not defaulted.

She is 43 years old, married, and the mother of two.  Her children are 15 and 10 years old and both in school.  She studied through sixth grade in the old school system and stopped when she became pregnant.  She takes care of her two children only.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 1996 Isaura's husband, who works for the national ministry of defense, was transferred and he, Isaura, and their children left the city of Maputo for Boane.  They live in her husband's barracks in the military area of the city.  <P>\r\n\r\nIsaura is a mobile shrimp vendor.  She learned how to conduct this business with friends six years ago.  She does not have any employees and works ten-hour days.  Now she can buy 10,000 MT (<em>meticais<\/em>)'s worth of shrimp, which after she sells it, earns her a profit of approximately 5,000 MT.  This amount, plus the amount her husband earns, supports the family, and she is able to put some money in a savings account.<P>\r\n\r\nWith the loan of 10,000 MT Isaura intends to invest in diversification of her products by purchasing squid and crab.  Her largest challenge\/goal is one day to buy a bigger freezer than her current one, so she can preserve her products better.  Her dream is to construct a small home one day.<P>\r\n\r\nIsaura learned about Hluvuku (Kiva's Field Partner) through its employees.  This is her second loan with the institution.  She previously received a loan of 5,000 MT, which she used to invest in her business and which she repaid successfully.  She has committed to continuing to pay properly and be able to access future loans.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

It is located two hours away from the city of Chiclayo, capital of the Lambayeque region.\r\n\r\nSince she was very young, Berelinda has been raising and selling barnyard fowl and small farm animals. She grows ducks, turkeys, chickens, and guinea pigs in order to later sell them to the merchants who visit the area where she lives. This business is very useful for Berelinda's family since the income from her husband's job as a construction worker is not sufficient to cover family expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nBerelinda has worked very hard, and little by little she was able to grow her business. With the profits received from the business, she has been setting up a small grocery shop in her house. She hopes that the shop will bring additional income that would allow her to improve the conditions for her family. \r\n\r\nBerelinda would like to expand her livestock business in order to keep moving forward and grow as an entrepreneur. This is why she is asking Edpyme Alternativa for her first loan in the amount of 1500 soles. She plans to invest the funds into the purchase of additional animals and balanced animal feed which would allow her to achieve her goals.\r\n\r\nBerelinda is a woman who is very devoted to her family; she enjoys working hard to help her family make progress. Her greatest wish is provide her son with an opportunity to go to college so that he could have a successful future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrei Vazhnov, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":522209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of small farm animals and animal feed to expand livestock business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Portada de la Sierra -

It is truly a dream come true for Mercedita as she herself possesses a college diploma and believes it is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMercedita operates a variety store where she sells not only groceries but LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) for fuel and cosmetics from the popular direct selling brands. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Philippine pesos (PHP) of cooking oil, or an egg. Juanita earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling at piece rate.

Baod, Bantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: pig-fattening and dress-making businesses. Her husband Demetrio C., who is 51 years old, works as a tricycle (three-wheeled vehicle) driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 14 children who are between 17 and 35 years old. \r\n\r\nBeverly joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Beverly has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to pay as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for future education of her children. Beverly C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She enjoys inventing new techniques of cultivating land and effective methods of raising cattle. There\u2019s a saying that a man should accomplish three main things in life: plant a tree, build a house and raise a son. Zulfiya\u2019s husband has performed all three, mainly thanks to this family business that they\u2019ve been running for eleven years already. \r\n\r\nZulfiya hopes to add the acquired loan to her monthly income of about $44 in order to purchase cattle and food for it. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Micro-finance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Resty, who is a mother to four, was prior to this mostly inclined to subsistence farming.  She still regards the day she set forth in this business as a watershed moment. Watershed in the sense that she has been able to better her family's standard of living with earnings from her business transactions. Before this, she was mostly relying on a small income from food sales.  \r\n\r\nThe Pub business has been paying dividends though she says she still has a lot of leeway to make up if she is to notch up more success in this enterprise. The Pub business is highly competitive and one needs to restock constantly with a variety of hard and soft beverages to meet the growing demands of clients. Her business has the potential to make headway in leaps and bounds provided she stays focused.\r\n\r\nThis business is one of the most lucrative businesses in the country at the moment and Resty knows hard work and the further revamping of her services and facilities will help a lot. \r\n\r\nShe carried out some refurbishment on her facilities late last year and the upshot was increased partiality to her services. That was, however, short lived as the operating costs shot up. Because she was paying more for rent, she was hard pressed in restocking with the best beverages that her clients ask for.  However, she managed to take that in her stride. Monthly she says her gross sales profits total up to Ugandan shillings 200,000. Resty says she is requesting this Kiva loan to purchase more crates of both hard and soft beverages like sodas and beers to resell.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":818693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and a videoke business. Her husband Eric G., who is 47 years old, works as a driver to earn his living. They have 5 children who are between 9 and 25 years old. One child already has a family, 3 are working and 1 is currently going to school. \r\n\r\nGina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, with which she intends to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and put up an additional business(poultry). \r\n\r\nGina G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Since the store\u2019s founding in 2006, Lower Haters has developed a dedicated following of artists, designers, friends, and fans.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nMarketing and finding new customers is Lower Haters\u2019 biggest challenge, according to Janice, but once people have visited they usually come back. All of the items found in Lower Haters are designed by local artists, so \u201cpeople feel connected to every piece in here. The artists often stop by the store, and we end up becoming a big family.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nJanice and Corey further foster that sense of community by actively participating in the neighborhood merchant\u2019s association, the Lower Haight Art Walk, and by transforming Lower Haters once a month for their late-night art receptions. In addition, they have begun hosting trunk shows where vendors are able to set up their own booths right in the shop, and interact directly with their customers.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nJanice and Corey now want to add silk-screening to the list of services that they can offer. Up-and-coming artists, who may not be able to afford the higher cost of small run printing services offered by other companies, will be able to bring their designs to print at Lower Haters. Printed t-shirts will be sold directly in the store, or made for concerts and other promotional events.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nBut despite Lower Haters\u2019 success and the new business that silk-screening will attract, Janice and Corey were unable to secure a small business loan from a traditional bank. With a $5,000 loan from Opportunity Fund, their local microlender, Janice and Corey will be able to purchase a used silkscreen machine and begin operating it at their store. They are excited about the collaborations this new equipment will allow them to pursue.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nTo find out more about Lower Haters and shop online,
