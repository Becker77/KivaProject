Working seven days a week and five hours a day, she supports her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid five loans from Patan BPW. She used her most recent loan to buy a young milk-giving cow.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Niru plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD .50.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction and as fuel for fires. It can also be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner microfinance institution, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Her husband Luisito is a miner. Irine is mother to two children, both of whom are already studying in elementary school. She, together with her husband and children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nIrine operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five Philippine Peso's (PHP)-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 PHP in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nIrine hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.

:"Fotima Y. has been selling office\/school supplies for 7 years now.  She has a secondary school education.  She is a widow and has 3 children, who help her in her business.  The children study in school, and since she substitutes as a father to them, she also works as a dishwasher in one of the cafeterias in the city.  She has been a client of  MLF \u2013 MicroInvest for almost 4 years.  She started by borrowing 300 somoni (currency of Tajikistan).  Thanks to her responsibility and discipline with MLF \u2013 MicroInvest she has increased her activity to 3000 somoni.

History of note includes: it was once a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki; and the birthplace of the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p> \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition when they request a loan. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and IMON will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is thankful to the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative for providing her loans, which she has used to buy her products in bulk and stores them in the freezer. She now earns more than P5,000.00 a month in net income, but her earnings sometimes vary depending on the supply and demand for frozen products.\r\n\r\nRoberta applied for a new loan of P12,000.00 from CCT so she can re-stock her frozen supplies.

She is married to a farmer and they have four children. Thanks to her dear husband's seeding skills she is very familiar with agricultural work. Her loving husband gave her farming fields 10 years ago and she's been working them ever since. At the same time she raises and sells cattle. These activities have helped to pay the economic expenses of her family. Dilbar's wishes to improve the quality of her products are what drives her to request a 5000 Somoni loan.

Make her request possible so that this hardworking mother can continue to develop her work, which gives her a lot of satisfaction.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great philosophers, scientists, and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina, Firdousi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others.The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mrs. S. started in the business of selling palm oil. Next she started selling thioub (dyed cotton cloth) from Mali and sometimes wax cloth (a high quality pagne cloth). She has 5 years of experience in this business. It is also a business that she chose for love and for necessity, as her husband is retired, and it is up to her to make money to financially support her children. Thus, she is seeking a 200,000-franc loan to be able to order thioubs in Mali through her daughter, who is a trader and often travels to buy goods. Holidays like the Tabaski (or Festival of Sacrifice) or the Korite bring her a lot of business, which allows her to meet her personal needs, as well as those of her family. It also allows her to take care of her medical expenses, since she is very sickly.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sherry W., Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The loan she is requesting is to buy melons, oranges, bananas, watermelons and mangos, etc.  Her greatest challenge is when the harvest season has concluded and products become expensive, making it necessary to work with loans.  She says she does not have much competition because she buys her merchandise before the harvest.  Teresa is 63 and although she does have competition she sells directly to the customer so her sales volume is satisfactory.  Mrs. Blanca is 54 and her husband works as a security guard.  They have two children.  They are now better off because her husband is working.  Her goal for the future is to gradually make home improvements with her earnings and loans.

She has a small table located in front of their house where she retails her goods. Before, she was selling vegetables and barbeque but she thought of changing her vending into bread, soft drinks, food seasonings and other commodities.\r\n\r\nShe is planning to have a small store to be able to make her vending convenient and comfortable for her customers. In this regard, she is requesting a loan of PHP 5,000 to be used in buying more items to sell so that her income will increase. Thus she will be able to have funds to build her store.\r\n\r\nSo far, she is earning a net income of 200 pesos daily. She really hopes that she will have more capital to make her business grow.

Supporting her partner with the household\u2019s expenses was a deciding factor in her current occupation, as she had worked in various arenas before deciding to dedicate herself to public transportation 6 years ago.  They managed to buy some vehicles that they rent to people who are in the transportation business.  Due to the delinquency that abounds in her zone, each time she leases out one of her vehicles she examines each potential renter very carefully.

She is 50 years old and has raised three children. Her eldest son works at a police station. Her middle daughter is married and her younger daughter is a college student. Nurbubu and her husband are, by their nature, very active people. Therefore, Nurbubu prefers a noisy and busy daily routine to the quietness of being at home. They sell foodstuffs in a small shop. \r\n\r\nAccording to them, it is always possible to set up a business.  In the beginning, Nurbubu did not have a container or a building to use when she wanted to start selling. So she and her husband made a small space right inside their house for their shop.  Long ago, Nurbubu already had experience selling dishes in a big market. This was an incentive for her to open a shop at home after her marriage. Investing just $45 in this undertaking, Nurbubu now earns three times as much on a monthly basis. This very same shop has given Nurbubu an opportunity to educate her children and build a new house. Now Nurbubu hopes that by using this loan she will be able to purchase more goods to enrich the assortment and increase the turnover.  Nurbubu plans to complete the building of their new house, see their son married and build a shed for keeping cattle.  \r\n\r\nNurbubu\u2019s partners are Nazgul, Kanitat and Ramis.  Nazgul, 31, has three children, all of whom are school students. Her husband works as a policeman. Nazgul is engaged in raising cattle and selling milk. Nazgul needs a loan to buy a cow.\r\n\r\nKanitat, 47, is a mother of three children. She is occupied with animal husbandry, selling milk and also needlework. Kanitat needs this loan to cover expenses related to harvesting wheat. \r\n\r\nRamis, 18, is single. Despite his young age, he and his brother, 17, already take care of his family, which consists of his mother and a five-year-old sister.  Ramis raises cattle and sells milk.  He needs this loan to plant wheat and purchase fuel.  He has decided to try farming and if everything goes well, become a farmer.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She has been in this business for over ten years and with MCDT for eight years, currently servicing her twentieth loan. Besides this banana business, she also sells beer at her home.

She could not continue her education through 8th grade due poverty; she had to leave school to fend for her younger brothers, because their father had died.<P>\r\n\r\nRebecca and her family live in the Zayzay community in Paynesville, but she sell in the Red-light market which is the biggest market in Paynesville, Liberia. Rebecca\u2019s business is the sale of 'fufu' (a locally made Liberian dish of cassava).  She has been running this business for more than 34 years and hopes to get involved in the real estate business.<P>\r\n\r\nRebecca started by selling children's clothes and her capital, 1000 Liberian Dollars, was given to her by her husband. She sells clean 'fufu' and talks to customers in a good manner in order to encourage them to continue buying from her. Rebecca needs this loan to add to her capital to improve her business. She dreams of giving her children a better education and building a house for her family in the future.<P>\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Rebecca is the one holding the sign.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:<P>\r\n\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.  Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship.  LEAP seeks to help rebuild post-conflict Liberia through its group and individual loans to micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs, and puts emphasis on lending to women.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":475520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more fufu for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Paynesville, Montserrado County","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.5 -9.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":141,"posted_date":"2010-01-22T23:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rebecca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janjay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Trobeh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LRD","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1239},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2205}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":17.55,"local_amount":1239,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1246.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123952505},{"amount":31.35,"local_amount":2213,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2225.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123952506},{"amount":152.83,"local_amount":10788,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":10850.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128985511},{"amount":66.58,"local_amount":4700,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4727.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136711324},{"amount":110.36,"local_amount":7790,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T07:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":7835.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144997880},{"amount":36.83,"local_amount":2600,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2615.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152755945},{"amount":9.5,"local_amount":670,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":673.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159667368}],"funded_date":"2010-01-23T01:37:18Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:32:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":175054,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth N.

She has four children, of which only one lives with her along with two grandchildren in a home she owns in the native community of Pucharini. Diana says her business consists of buying and selling clothing. She acquires her merchandise at wholesale from the \"Gamarra\" center in the city of Lima. Once purchased, she travels through the native communities of Pichanaki and sell the items, since she has customers there who make orders in advance, so she has the security of always having faithful buyers. At the same time, although at a smaller scale, she works in the fields harvesting bananas, avocado, coffee and citrus fruits. She assures that her clothing sales have always been lucrative, attracting regular customers. \"On good days my investment of 1,000 soles triples,\" she says excitedly. As far as problems she has had to overcome, Diana mentions the lack of her own capital as principal, but with time and thanks to her tireless work, this enterprising woman plans to open up a convenience store so she won't have to travel as much. With your support, Diana will obtain her fourth loan through Kiva partner MFP, an organization she is grateful to, and promises to work hard to make her payments. At the same time she feels content working with her community bank because some of the members also make a living in the same trade. Once she obtains the credit, she will travel to the city of Lima to invest 2,000 soles in the purchase of clothing, since she already has confirmed clients for December and January."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":905110,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase clothing in the city of Lima.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-27T02:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":716.3,"local_amount":1910.14,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1945.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455279},{"amount":33.7,"local_amount":89.86,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":91.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452413}],"funded_date":"2011-11-11T19:29:27Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":355835,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is married with seven children.

However, Roxana's husband's luck is not so good, since he was fired from his previous job due to his company downsizing. Because of this, Roxana had to figure out how to help her family get through this. And so it was that she got a job with a woman who owned a beauty salon close to her house, and she learned how to apply artificial fingernails, which she was really good at. After a few months, she decided to start her own business applying artificial fingernail, which has allowed her to support her family.<p>\r\n\r\nRight now, her husband does have a job, but Roxana is determined to grow this business so that it can be left as patrimony to her daughter. Roxana is convinced that this winter season is the best for the application of artificial fingernails, since many women have parties and want to look their best. This is why she is requesting a loan for US $ 635 to be paid within 6 months. With this money Roxana will be able to buy more materials to apply more fingernails, and so be able to buy a small gift to her daughter as a reward for studying hard and getting ahead.

Mario has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Mario joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

Mario is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand his product offerings. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Mario from GDMPC.

One of her cousins allows her to use a storage space which is located near her clients, in order to store her cleaning products. Adelia hopes to use this loan to purchase various cleaning products which she plans to sell to mechanics. She says that the products she sells are top quality products in high demand.\r\n\r\nThe loan consultant who has been working with Adelia describes her as a hardworking entrepreneur with a fighting spirit who is dedicated to her business. Adelia has lupus, but she doesn\u00b4t let her illness prevent her from living a normal life. In general, Adelia carries out domestic tasks in the mornings: preparing breakfast and lunch, cleaning the house, etc. The afternoons are dedicated to her business: seeking new clients, collecting payments from existing clients and making sales. Adelia's goal is to one day work in a centralized location, a small store, where she could offer her clients various cleaning products. At the moment, the only factor standing in the way of progress is a lack of working capital.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Arlene earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nTeodora hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she fervently hopes that her business will stabilize and be successful one day.

Before she sold tamales she also sold cosmetics and clothing to the tobacco factory workers.  Now she buys 1,500 ears of corn every three days and has five sellers and three bicycles that they use to sell the products in the streets.  She would like for her products to be sold in the fairs and supermarkets in order to increase her sales.  \r\nShe is requesting the loan to buy 4000 ears of corn as this will help her to buy ingredients and increase her sales.

They have five children, only one of which lives with them in the farmhouse they own in Huanchan. Luisa has been farming for 28 years. Her main crops are potatoes, peas, maize, and beans, which she plants on her 18-hectare farm.\r\n\r\nWhat Luisa most enjoys about her work is selling her harvest in the local markets so that she can see the results of her hard work. She also raises small livestock such as cows, pigs and rams. After raising the animals she sells them at a higher price, averaging about 150 PEN per animal and higher for male animals. \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is lack of working capital, since she can't rely on daily income. Luisa belongs to the \u201cUni\u00f3n Huanchan\u201d community bank, and this is her third loan with MFP. She is grateful for the continuous support from her bank.

These items are purchased at the main market of SAN City. Following the off-season, the harvested crops are stocked for a certain time, so that they gain value. And then they are sold retail (and often in bulk) and for cash at the main markets of SAN and DAH and at surrounding markets.

There are 52 \"comunidades\", \"recintos\" and \"cooperativas distribuidas\" [local geographical entities] in the canton, along with important resources such as the Mindo Nambillo National Forest.  Much of the canton is pasture land and ranching is an important business.  Local farmers grow palmito, sugar cane, platanos and fruit on small plots here.  Pedro has lived on his own for a year.  He has a son, but the son doesn't live with him.\r\n\r\nPedro's parents have a natural medicines business and he learned the business from them.  He opened his own shop 5 years ago and has made good progress.  He wants to expand the business now and he needs a loan because he can't add the inventory he wants without one.

(\"One Heart\" in Quechua) Village Bank is maD. up of fifteen women from the Paucar\u00e1 community of Acobamba Province in central Peru. Paucar\u00e1 is located about 3200 meters above sea level and is mostly flat, with a chilly climate suited to to grow grains and tubers. Most members of the community are dedicated to raising livestock or farming, while others sell merchandise in local markets. \n\nNorma and Martina are two members of Huk SunqulL..\n\nNorma is married with three children who are 12, 8 and 5 years old and are all currently in school. Norma is a schoolteacher, but she is not paid enough to live on, so she also sells dry goods (rice, sugar, flour) at the local Sunday market. When she first started it was tough, since people gossiped about her having to have two jobs, but she says she has gotten past that. In the beginning, her husband didn't want to let her go out to the market to work as a vendor, but once he realized she was earning money he started to help her. Today, Norma says that her business has grown a lot since she started working with FINCA, and her husband is now very understanding. She has developed a better relationship with her family, too. Norma is requesting a loan of 600 soles (US$200) to buy a wider variety of merchandise to sell at her market stall. Norma's dream is to buy a car and for her children to graduate with professional degrees. \n\nMartina is married with two children who are 18 and 12 years old. Martina sells lamb soup and chicken soup in local markets, and also sells at meetings of the \"Juntos\" program. She has increased her sales since she started selling soup at these meetings, since she used to just work at markets. Martina is requesting a loan of 600 soles to buy more lamb to make soup to bring to other local markets. She says that FINCA has taught her good values and how to be responsible with herself and her family. Her dream in life is to build her own house and to open her own store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":230663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy lamb, dry goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T13:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma Semida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salesiana Tarcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violeta Yobana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eleodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luzmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1500,"local_amount":4599.99,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4637.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215124},{"amount":500,"local_amount":1533.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1545.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396838},{"amount":500,"local_amount":1533.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1545.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088515},{"amount":500,"local_amount":1533.35,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1545.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35981952}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T18:22:12Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:04:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":80455,"name":"Cynthia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cynthia A. sells food items like rice and sugar at Atonkwa near Elmina.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which began soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

que sue\u00f1a verlo crecer y ayudarla a su prosperidad familiar, para lo cual dirige todos sus esfuerzos.   \n \nNora se siente satisfecha de la vida, da gracias a Dios diariamente por estar viva y reafirma el proverbio que dice no hay mal que por bien no venga, porque con el desplazamiento ella encontr\u00f3 la oportunidad de tener un mejor futuro en otra tierra, que  quiz\u00e1s no hubiera logrado en el lugar que la vio nacer. \n\nEn su negocio llamado \u201cConfecciones Angie\u201d, compra telas e insumos de bajo costo y elabora vestidos econ\u00f3micos, ella dice que con ello contribuye a aliviar la problem\u00e1tica de capacidad de compra que tienen las personas que viven en su barrio y sus alrededores, pues \u201csus clientes se sientan muy satisfechos al poder estrenar un vestido nuevo\u201d. \nSu primer cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, fue por valor de $1.500.000 que reembols\u00f3 estrictamente de acuerdo a su plan de amortizaci\u00f3n, pues lo invirti\u00f3 en mercanc\u00edas y variedades que le ayudaron a obtener una buena utilidad para poder adquirir nuevos electrodom\u00e9sticos y utensilios  para su hogar que aun no pose\u00eda; en la actualidad aplica a un cr\u00e9dito por valor de $2.000.000, que invertir\u00e1 en la compra de materia prima e insumos para la confecci\u00f3n de ropa, en comprar calzado y vestidos infantiles para surtir su vitrina y en adquirir una maquina de cocer nueva,  pues adem\u00e1s de confeccionar  tambi\u00e9n vende mercanc\u00eda en su barrio.\n\nSu m\u00e1ximo sue\u00f1o es obtener una vivienda y un local para organizar y expandir su negocio logrando adquirir tecnolog\u00eda de punta  y  posicionarse en el mercado ofreciendo muchos puestos de trabajo y logrando dividendos que le ayuden al crecimiento humano, espiritual, profesional, de sus hijos y de sus futuros empleados. \n\nSu desafi\u00f3 actual es la falta de maquinaria adecuada para hacer un trabajo de mejor calidad  y recibir capacitaci\u00f3n y  en uni\u00f3n de su esposo y de su familia emprender el montaje  y desarrollo de una gran empresa de confecciones.\n\n","en":"Nora Elena Garc\u00eda B. is 33 years old and lives in the traditional neighborhood Olaya Herrera in Cartagena.  She is a native of the town of San Juan de Nepomuceno in the department of Bol\u00edvar, which at the this moment has been hit with insecurity, violence and forced displacement, requiring Nora to flee this conflict area 5 years ago to the city of Cartagena.  She fled along with her 3 children of 9,7,and 2 years and her husband, who works in the countryside since he could not find decent work in the city.  It was thus that she assumed the responsibility of supporting the household, practicing her trade as a seamstress that she learned when she was very young.  With the help of a generous couple who gave her a sewing machine she was able to start, with great enthusiasm, the business that she has today.  She hopes to see this business grow and help her family become more prosperous, and she directs all of her efforts toward these goals.  \n\nShe feels satisfied with her life, and gives thanks to God daily for being alive.  She reaffirms the saying that every cloud has a silver lining, because with the displacement she found the opportunity to have a better future in a different place, which perhaps she might not have had in the place where she was born.  In her business, called \"Confecciones Angie\" (Creations by Angie), she buys fabrics and supplies at low cost and makes economical dresses.  She says that with this business she helps alleviate the problem that people have in her neighborhood of not having enough money to buy new clothing, and says that \"her customers feel very satisfied being able to wear a new dress for the first time.\"  \n\nHer first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation was for $1,500, which she paid back strictly according to the established schedule.  She invested it in a variety of merchandise that helped her to obtain greater profits, which enabled her to acquire new household appliances and utensils that she did not yet have. She is now applying for a loan of $2,000 that she will use to buy raw materials and supplies to make clothing, to buy shoes and baby clothes to put on sale in her glass display case, and to acquire a new sewing machine, because in addition to making clothes she also sells merchandise in her neighborhood.  \n\nHer greatest dream is to have a home and a place to organize and expand her business, managing to acquire state-of-the-art technology and positioning herself in the market offering many jobs and generating profits to help the human, spiritual and professional growth of her children and future employees.  Her current challenge is that she lacks the adequate training and machinery to do work of the best quality and to start, along with her husband and his family, to set up and develop a large apparel company.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

For the past year she has worked with a friend raising and selling chickens. She says that the work is straightforward as they only have to provide what is necessary for the chickens to grow without difficulty and then, after one month, they sell them at a good price to their friends and acquaintances, who need them for food or to sell. She doesn't like that the chickens often become sick because they are quite delicate, but she is pleased that they grow quickly and so they can get regular income. She says that this business is quite profitable and the income enables her to help her husband with the household expenses. As she is an enterprising woman, in the future she plans to grow the business and for this she and her friend need to buy some land to increase the number of chickens they can keep and raise them in more space. This is the second loan that she has had from MFP, and she promises to make her repayments punctually so as to not disappoint all the people who have made the loan possible and are helping her to continue working. Graciela plans to use the loan to buy food and fatten-up the chickens, and so have them grow more quickly so they can sell them and generate good profits. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":595111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy chicken feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-03T22:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":122.9},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":138.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":142.52},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":148.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":153.15},{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":159.34},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":165.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":168.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.03},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.44},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.76},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.43},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.09,"local_amount":122.9,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":128.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154593},{"amount":52.03,"local_amount":138.75,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":145.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449905},{"amount":53.87,"local_amount":143.66,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":150.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588604},{"amount":55.33,"local_amount":147.53,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":154.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725109},{"amount":57.43,"local_amount":153.15,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":160.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463204},{"amount":69.89,"local_amount":186.37,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":195.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886609},{"amount":63.24,"local_amount":168.63,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":176.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326944},{"amount":52.12,"local_amount":139.01,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270325}],"funded_date":"2010-09-04T10:01:14Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":232891,"name":"Rakel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rakel B. is from the village of Poblacion, Lantapan, Bukidnon.

Together with Julia, his wife of ten years, he cares for their children in their own home, which is located in the district of Acostambo. \"I have many goals to fulfill,\" he declares. \r\n\r\nAlthough he doesn't have the money necessary to buy his own agricultural land, he doesn't let this discourage him. Every day he puts more effort into his work, and saves what he can towards buying land. Already Cesar has seven years of experience growing potatoes, other tuber vegetables such as ulluco, oca, and mashua, barley, broad beans, and peas. He says that he rents plots of land from his community because it costs less and this way he also supports growth for its inhabitants. \r\n\r\nFor every harvest he takes advantage of his trips to the capital to sell his crops. He travels twice a week, bringing maca, peas and potatoes, which he sells at \"La parada\", the largest market in the country. \r\n\r\nAs he's a country man, he takes advantage of owning three horses and three donkeys and uses them as cargo animals to transport fertilizer to the fields. \"This way I get less tired,\" he explains. \r\n\r\nThis is Cesar's fifth loan with MFP, and is happy to know that he will have financial support and feels secure continuing with his work. Apart from anything else he promises to comply with his payments. Furthermore he appreciates being a part of his community bank because all of the members are responsible and supportive. \r\n\r\nUpon receiving the funds, Cesar will invest the money requested in the purchase of natural fertilizers to spread on his crops, which include several varieties of potato such as yungay, canch\u00e1n, Andean and huario macho.

That was mainly thanks to her daughters, who advised her that she had already spent too much time doing physically demanding work in people's homes which could lead to long-term health problems. Carmina has supported her business and that of her husband through loans from EDAPROSPO for the past eight months. Both of them have pooled their incomes to cover the expenses of their home and their 14- and 11-year-old daughters. Together, they also make the monthly repayments on their loans. In the future, Carmina would like to expand her store into a mini-mart, specializing in soft drinks, beer and sweets, as these are the products she profits most from, and unlike groceries, they don't spoil. At any rate, before she invests much more in her business, she wants to invest in her daughters' education, and once they have completed their studies she will invest everything in her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":280681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Invest part in her store, and the rest in her husband's recycling business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T23:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":190,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59.67,"local_amount":56.69,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":59.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084952},{"amount":40.32,"local_amount":38.31,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":40.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978432},{"amount":100.01,"local_amount":95,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-23T07:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439320}],"funded_date":"2009-03-10T02:20:57Z","paid_date":"2009-06-23T07:39:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trisha Bury","image":804995}},{"id":96855,"name":"Jameda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jameda A. is married and has 6 dependents.

Safarali has been in the livestock business for many years. He supports his wife and four children. Since he began his business, he has worked hard to use his earnings to sustain his home. His livestock business has helped him to achieve his goals. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, Safarali needs to purchase more livestock in order to grow his business and improve the living conditions of his family. He is seeking a loan from IMON International in order to acquire additional animals to offer in the markets.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes \r\n\r\nand its rich history which includes its place as a key post \r\n\r\nalong the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the \r\n\r\nGreat's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, \r\n\r\nscientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), \r\n\r\nFirdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The \r\n\r\ncountry is home to communities that still speak the ancient \r\n\r\nSogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th \r\n\r\nmillennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the \r\n\r\nIslamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central \r\n\r\nAsian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A \r\n\r\ncivil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the \r\n\r\nU.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, \r\n\r\n93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is \r\n\r\narable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of \r\n\r\nunemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work \r\n\r\nin other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of \r\n\r\nTajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity \r\n\r\nand the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the \r\n\r\npopulation still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with \r\n\r\nKiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients \r\n\r\nrepresent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva \r\n\r\nhave already been distributed to thousands of IMON \r\n\r\nInternational's clients and will continue to provide thousands \r\n\r\nmore with permanent access to the varied financial services they \r\n\r\nneed.

There is also a stone face carved in a mountain by the Inca. It is a beautiful place that is always visited by local and international tourists. Our members are happy to have inherited the culture and traditions of the Inca, and they carry the honor and the pride of Inga Pirca in their daily lives.\r\n<p>\r\nThe communal bank \"La Inmaculada\" is formed by a group of 10 men and women, who are all ready to overcome and move forward little by little. We have some of their stories here.\r\n<p>\r\nEsther Yolanda L. P. is a member of the bank She lives in Inga Pirca, and is 22 years old. She has lived with a partner for one year. She has three children who are 6, 4, and 1 year old. Her first son is in the community school. They do not have their own home; they live in a house that a family member is lending them for a while. Her husband is a chauffeur, and supports her in everything. She says he is a pillar in her life.\r\n<p>\r\nEsther works as a domestic employee in the city center, and in the little time that she has at home, she raises chickens and guinea pigs.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan, and she is interested in the benefits she can receive as a member of the Espoir Foundation. With this loan she is going to start a chicken coop, so that she can stop working for other people and dedicate herself to her children and her business. Her dream is to have her own home.\r\n<p>\r\n Mariana de Jes\u00fas V. lives in the Santa B\u00e1rbara neighborhood in the Santa Ana parish, 40 minutes outside of Cuenca. She is 43 years old, and is the single mother of 5 children who are 22, 19, 14, 6, 3 months. The first two are not recognized by their father and have their own home. The younger three are recognized by their father, but he does not help them with anything. Her 14-year-old son often takes care of the house until Mariana comes home from work. They live in their own adobe house, which is an advantage.\r\n<p>\r\nMariana works as a domestic employee in the center of the city. She also raises chickens and guinea pigs, which she feeds before and after work.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan. She learned about the benefits and opportunities of the Espoir Foundation thanks to a friend who invited her to be part of the communal bank. With the loan, she will get a chicken hatchery so she can have her own business and improve the quality of life of her family, to help them move forward like she has been doing.\r\n<p>\r\nHer dream is to have a brick house, so they can live comfortably without worrying about the winter, and give her children a better life.\r\n<p>\r\nMartha Adriana L. is another member of the bank. She lives in Inga Pirca, in a beautiful place in the Ca\u00f1ar area. She is 21 years old, and lives with her partner of five years, and they get along very well. She has two children, who are 3 and 1 and a half. Her husband works in construction, and they have their own home.\r\n<p>\r\nMartha is a domestic employee from Monday to Friday. On weekends she works on her business. She raises pigs, chickens, and guinea pigs, although her guinea pigs recently died. Now she is trying to recover from that loss. She also slaughtered a pig from her farm, and she sold the raw meat by the pound. She says that sales are good.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan, and she feels happy to have entered this little bank, because she knows the benefits that the foundation offers, and the members are friends in the community and are ready to overcome.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be invested in pigs for her farm.\r\n<p>\r\nHer goal is to have a store, because there are few in her community, and to be able to only run her business so she can have more time to care for her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Iverson, Kiva

For two years he has been making these clothes for festivals that are popular in the towns in the outskirts of his region.  Sometimes he works with his father on special jobs.

Emelda dreams of securing the future of her family and lifting them out of poverty by giving her daughters an education, sending them to earn college degrees when they grow up. She is very optimistic that she will achieve this goal because her daughters excel in school - both earning first honors in the past year. <p>\r\n\r\nAt first, only her husband was engaged in selling \u201cBalut\u201d around their community, neighboring villages and the nearby towns, but even with his best efforts, his income could not provide for everything that the family needs. Since \"Balut\" is such a popular Filipino snack, Emelda knew that if she helped her husband and sold \"Balut\" in other places, she'd would earn an income, and this is what she did. When she was able to save enough, she put up a small general store adjacent to her house, but she also continued with her \"Balut\" vending.<p>\r\n\r\nWhen she needed fresh capital to expand her business, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005. She reciprocates the support provided by NWTF-PD by paying back her weekly installments on time and paying the loan in full within the set loan term. Emelda has continuously maintained her good credit standing, and the loans she takes help her increase her income potential. Her present average monthly income is PHP 9,000, which enables her to save for her daughters' future education.<p>\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, her twelfth, she borrowed Php 10,000 as additional capital for her \u201cBalut\u201d business. Now that she has fully repaid that loan within its term, she plans to take another loan of PHP 13,000 for her 13th cycle loan which she plans to use to purchase additional inventory and working capital for her business. She intends to use the income from this loan to continue supporting the household expenses and the education of her daughters.<p>\r\n\r\nEmelda is shown in the picture posing inside her general store with some of the \"balut\" eggs.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few but thousands of women.

She is 49 years-old. Liza is the leader of a ten member group loan offered by Kiva partner ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLiza is widowed and has two adult children. Liza owns and operates a general store which sells both food and daily use products in the local community. Liza has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 500 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Liza joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Liza is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Liza from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and North-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":464092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Sara used to work selling dresses, but now she spends her time taking care of her younger daughter.  She currently works selling food during the weekends, and makes different stews for her customers.  She has spent the past 7 years working in various businesses, which have always been profitable.  She enjoys cooking typical rural Peruvian food, which is why she would like to have her own restaurant in the future.  For this reason Sara would like to re-start selling shoes and dresses.

If this weren\u2019t enough, she also works attaching beadwork to articles of clothing.  In this job, she works with a middleman who leaves the items of clothing with her and then pays her when she delivers the finished products.  Since she\u2019s a very enterprising woman, she plans for later in the future to improve the set up in the videogames business in order to improve her profits.\r\n\r\nThis is her 7th loan with MFP and
