This will be his 10th loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he doesn't want to default on his payments so he can continue looking for more work and making more money and do right by the people who made this loan possible. With the loan of 1,500 soles he is requesting, he plans to purchase wooden planks and metal post so he will be able to do construction jobs.

Her in-laws would not let her live a peaceful life, that notwithstanding, she also has the problem of inadequate capital to start up a good business for income generation. \r\n\r\nShe has taken and repaid loans 10 times since she joined GHAPE in the year 2002.  The amount she is requesting will be used to buy motor spare parts to add to what she already has.  She thinks she will succeed in the business because of the expertise she has gotten and the marketing techniques acquired in relation to this business venture.  Her activity will help the community since car owners will buy parts to repair their cars at cheaper rates. \r\n\r\nWith the profit obtained from this loan she will use it to improve on her standard of living, pay tuition fees for her children and improve her family's financial problems.  She prefers a loan from GHAPE because it is easy to obtain a loan from GHAPE and with low interest rates and the period of repayment is gradual.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

They live in their own house located in the Parque Industrial neighborhood of the Pichari district.  When a business or activity that one is involved with is no longer profitable, an immediate change is necessary, if not, whatever capital one had invested could be lost.  This is the case with Yanet, who in time noticed that her business of selling groceries was no longer profitable because on the block where she lives there are many stores selling groceries.  That is why she decided to buy and sell small animals in her space that previously was the grocery store.  She has acquired many customers in the small time that she has been in business.  She not only sells animals but also added the sale of ground spices which has also provided a good income.  She is excited about the good income that she is earning up until now with the help of her husband and her repeat customers.

She sells shoes and sandals every day in the city of Caman\u00e1, located in the south of Peru. This area is a vast and dry oasis in the Desierto de Sechura, which dominates the south-eastern coast of the country. Caman\u00e1 has historically been an important tourist destination in Peru. However, the frequent and strong earthquakes and tsunamis in the past decade (an 8.4 in 2001 and an 8.0 in 2007) decimated the city, destroyed the tourist industry in Caman\u00e1, as well as jobs, livelihoods, and homes. The result of this unemployment has been the creation of an atmosphere ripe for microfinancing. Microfinancing gives people with small businesses and few resources business opportunities in the labour market.\r\n\r\nLeonarda's husband is a master builder, and this brings in a good income. They use this money to invest in the small business, as well as in the care and education of their little children. The youngest is barely two years old, and the oldest is 8. Leonarda tells us that one of her favourite dishes is \u201cChupe de Camarones\u201d [Shrimp Chowder]. In Caman\u00e1 it is easy to find and enjoy this delicious dish because they are very close to the sea--this guarantees the freshness of the product.\r\n\r\nLeonarda is a woman who works an average of eleven hours a day. This allows her to make 130 Soles per day. With this money, she is able to pay the original cost of the shoes. She thinks that her business is successful because she provides good customer service and is very charismatic. Thanks to the Kiva lenders, she will be able to buy new merchandise to sell. This will allow her to provide better customer service, thus making a better income. Her dream is to be able to expand the size of her business and therefore increase her income in order to be able to thatch the roof of her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":951613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

Amelia esta pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito para comprar insecticidas, abono org\u00e1nico, fertilizantes, calidra y arboles de aguacate. La meta de do\u00f1a Amelia es seguir haciendo crecer su huerto y cuando empiece a tener ganancias quiere poner la cerca nueva para que los animales no se le metan a comer sus arboles. Dice que ella esta muy contenta con trabajar con la financiera por que gracias a esta su negocio si esta funcionando y espera nunca defraudarla ya que le tendieron la mano cuando mas lo necesitaba.\n\n","en":"Amelia is a 58 year old widow.  She had five children, but she lives alone because her children are married.\r\n\r\nShe says that she is from a place that is rich in nature.  The inhabitants safeguard the forests because the loggers cut the trees without permission.  She says that in her community the people preserve their roots.  They speak and dress \u201cmazahua\u201d (an indigenous people of Mexico), which they are proud of.\r\n\r\nAmelia says she started to grow avocadoes over two years ago.  She says that, \u201ceven though it is a business in the long term, it pleases me to grow this fruit because it is well suited to the climate.  The crop is not difficult to take care of, and shortly they will bear fruit in May.  God willing, I will have my first harvest even though various little trees started to bear fruit.\u201d  \r\n\r\nShe says that now, as she does not have any income from the avocados, she makes crafts from \u201cocoshal\u201d (dry leaves that come from a pine tree).  She makes things like napkin rings, bread baskets, jewelry cases, fruit dishes, and decorative vases.  She takes them to sell at the Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary because it is very close to her area.  \r\n\r\nAmelia is asking for a loan to buy insecticides, organic fertilizer, fertilizers, Calidra (brand of hydrated lime powder), and avocado trees.   Amelia\u2019s goal is to continue making her orchard grow.  When she starts to have income she wants to put up a new fence so that the animals do not get in and eat her trees.  \r\n\r\nShe says that she is very happy to work with the loan because, thanks to the loan, her business is functioning.  She hopes to never let the lenders down because they lent a hand when she needed it most.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":964385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy insecticides, organic fertilizer, fertilizers, Calidra (brand of hydrated lime powder), and avocado trees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-12-29T20:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":895.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":938.45},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":955.97},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":973.81},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":991.99},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1010.51},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1029.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1048.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1068.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1088.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.89},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.31},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.02},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":132.93,"local_amount":1833.53,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1858.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193884},{"amount":211.83,"local_amount":2921.77,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2961.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330240},{"amount":73.26,"local_amount":1010.5,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044258},{"amount":228.09,"local_amount":3146.13,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3188.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656453},{"amount":78.89,"local_amount":1088.07,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:57:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1102.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317169}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T22:12:55Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T16:57:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":380869,"name":"Zoila Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Zoila de 24 a\u00f1os fue educada por su madre con mucha responsabilidad y valores morales en los que enmarca su vida, pues al quedar hu\u00e9rfana vio como su madre los sac\u00f3 adelante y la llev\u00f3 a lograr su licenciatura en matem\u00e1ticas.

She is the owner of a business that sells all types of beverages and staple products, and she has been working at this business for more than five years.  She says that she was sick and had to rest for one month.  This generated a lot of expenses and her business lost money, but thanks to the loans that the Paraguay Foundation gave her, she was able to regain this capital and thus could buy all sorts of merchandise such as sugar, milk, meat, all types of beverages, yerba mate (tea), rice, noodles, oil, etc.  Now her business is newly stocked, but she always has current customers who are waiting for the products that she sells.  She plans to do additional work and at the same time run her current business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

This year they have planted 30 sacks of seeds in irrigated fields and 20 sacks in seasonal fields, thanks to the help of their children who still accompany them. Both feel very satisfied and thankful to the land that provides them its fruits. Once they have collected their harvest, they will contract a truck to transport it to various markets for its sale, recuperate their investment and return to plant the next field.

She has worked for four years selling cosmetics, a job that she does with much joy, as she has the chance to make a good income.  In order to increase her sales, she has to go out and visit her friends and relatives, who are her regular clients.  She does this work from 9am until 6pm, and she becomes very tired from the long distances that she must travel, trying to make the trips quickly so she can arrive home with time to support her children\u2019s educational activities.  For this reason she has decided to use her savings of many years to buy a moto-car which she will use for public transport.  She will administer the earnings from her home, and in this way will have extra income, which will make up for the additional time that she will dedicate to her family without having to leave to sell her cosmetics.  This is her first individual loan, but she continues working happily with the communal bank, Kiva partner Microfinanzas Prisma, to which she has belonged for many years and where she is very committed to the growth of the group.

Her oldest son is already earning for himself and the other one has just finished a nursing degree in college.\r\n<p>\r\nSaveniana and her husband parted ways almost two decades ago.  She was left to care for and rear her 2 sons. But this never hindered her from moving forward.  She went into business.  She owns a general store, which has been running for the last 7 years.  And just last year, she opened a store for RTW (ready-to-wear) clothes in Cartimar.  She used her savings as capital for this new business.  She makes P25,000.00 a month out of the combined proceeds of her businesses.\r\n<p>\r\nSaveniana joined Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2002.  Since then, she has been enjoying the benefits it provides to its clients.  Through the years, she became an inspiration to CCT members, old and new, especially by showing her endurance to her trials and challenges as she raised her sons and supported their education.\r\n<p>\r\nSaveniana has applied for a new loan of P17,000.00.  She will use these funds to purchase additional inventory (clothes and beauty accessories) for her bazaar.  At this point of her life, Saveniana could never ask for more.

She is also a source of support for her husband in the various roles they have, such as parents of two children who live with them in the house which they managed to build after a great deal of effort. Five years ago they had the chance to acquire three \u2018motocarros\u2019 (three-wheeled motorized carts), which are a great help in making ends meet. Carmen manages the business and makes sure the motocarros are working properly. The vehicles are rented to various people, generally young men, who earn a living by transporting passengers in these \u2018taxis\u2019. For this reason Carmen checks that they are responsible people and use the motocarros in an appropriate manner.

He is a construction worker and his wife, Mrs. Sothea Nhel, is a farmer who owns 2 hectares of land to cultivate rice on to support her family. Now they are facing an obstacle because their house is too old to live in, but they do not have money to repair it.

He owns a minivan and offers transportation services in the city. He understands his role as the head and provider for his family, and is ready to work 24\/7 to provide for the needs of his loved ones. He has been faithfully working in this business for eight years. \r\n\r\nAbdumavlon has found his niche in this business. Today, it\u2019s a lot harder to start your own business as a public van driver. Currently, Abdumavlon\u2019s net profit is about $500 a month. An economical diesel engine in his vehicle helps him reduce his operating costs and adds to his bottom line. Loans that Abdumavlon has received from IMON International have helped to promote stability and growth in his business. \r\n\r\nAbdumavlon is asking for a loan of 7,000 Somoni to purchase necessary car parts to fix his minivan. He understands the effort and commitment it takes to be a private entrepreneur and is willing to work hard in his business to be able to support his family, which is the first priority in his life. \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Geofrey is the facilitator of the group. This group joined One Acre Fund in the year 2011 and will re-enroll in the 2012 program. \r\n\r\nGeofrey takes care of six children at home. He joined One Acre Fund in order to grow enough to feed his family and access fertilizer and hybrid seeds. In the recent 2011 season, he had a very good maize yield harvesting 12 1\/2 bags on one acre of land.

She's asking for a loan to stock summer products because in the beach season there will be a big demand for sardines, canned tuna, etc.  By working hard and using credit wisely, she hopes her small store will ultimately become a large general store and that when she is older, her children will take it over as a family business so that they can lead dignified lives.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Elvira R., es madre solera de 45 a\u00f1os, habita en una humilde vivienda del Barrio Laureles Sur  y desde hace 10 a\u00f1os de forma improvisada mont\u00f3 una peque\u00f1a venta de productos varios, con cr\u00e9ditos ha venido creciendo y hoy en d\u00eda tiene una pulper\u00eda abastecida con toda clase de productos de alimentos l\u00e1cteos, enlatados, alimentos crudos como  frijoles y arroz entre otras cosas de importancia en el hogar como papel higi\u00e9nico, pasta de dientes, etc. Solicita un  Pr\u00e9stamo para abastecer de productos de verano para esta \u00e9poca de playa  en que se demanda mucho las sardinas, at\u00fan enlatados, con su esfuerzo y el buen uso de sus cr\u00e9ditos su sue\u00f1o es  que su pulper\u00eda sea una  Miscel\u00e1nea grande y que cuando ella este mayor sus  hijos la administren y mejoren el negocio familiar con el cual su madre pudo darles una vida digna."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":137688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy product for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-03-08T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-23T18:05:44Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":13520,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2253.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2253.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2253.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2253.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2253.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2253.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":121,"local_amount":2256.44,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2307.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189717},{"amount":121,"local_amount":2256.44,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:47:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2307.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217787},{"amount":121,"local_amount":2256.44,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2307.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246779},{"amount":121,"local_amount":2256.44,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2307.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":275342},{"amount":121,"local_amount":2256.44,"processed_date":"2008-08-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2307.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":304890},{"amount":120,"local_amount":2237.79,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-24T07:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2288.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335838}],"funded_date":"2008-03-09T18:05:44Z","paid_date":"2008-09-24T07:07:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":44021,"name":"Fatima Rosario","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"F\u00e1tima C. is married and has an 8-year old daughter who is an elementary school student.

Martha has 4 children.  Her oldest son is 45 and self-employed, her second son is 38 and self-employed, her 33 year-old daughter is studying the 5th year of secondary school, and her other son is 28 and studying for an Advanced Technical Degree.  Her husband does not work due to his advanced age.  Her proposal is to expand her business and turn it into a cafeteria where she can offer customers home-style cooking and a la carte meals.  She also hopes to have a store so that she can have various incomes to meet the difficult economic situation.\r\n\r\nIn her business she sells meals: breakfast, lunch, and refreshments.  She has had this business for 10 years and works at it daily.  She started this business with a small table where she sold fruits and vegetables.  Then later she decided to put together a store, which she started with only a few items.  However because of personal problems she decided to make a trip out of the country, and she had no choice but to leave her daughter in charge of the business.  When she decided to return to the country her business had completely declined, and she tried to start over again with another by selling food.  This is what she has been committed to until now, so that what happened to her other business does not happen again.  She has a variety of customers like doctors, nurses, and employees from different places.  The loan is for capital to buy fresh fruits and vegetables to make natural refreshments and fresh meat for making her different meals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelly Wester, Kiva

market, ask anyone about Munavvarhon A.. Everyone knows her. She has sold leafy green vegetables for the past ten years, starting out with dill, parsley, garlic, radishes and sorrel. Her inventory additionally includes canned fruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\nMunavvarhon previously lived and worked in Kanibadam, but after the death of her husband she moved to Isfara. Her daughters married and she now lives with her 18-year-old grandson.  \r\n\r\nAlthough she is 53 years old, Munavvarhon herself travels to Khojand twice a week to buy greens. Her friends also supply her with vegetables from Kokand, Uzbekistan at a good price. In the spring Munavvarhon grows dill, parsley and salad greens in her own garden.  She recognizes that competition is fierce and prices have begun to rise.  She does all she can to improve her business, and offers discounts on bulk orders in order to keep customers. For the past two years Munavvarhon has taken out business loans and she acknowledges that it is thanks to MicroInvest that she was able to expand her range of products.  Taking advantage of the low summertime prices, with the last loan she purchased a large quantity of canned goods and vegetables in order to stock up for the winter. She is planning to open an additional retail outlet with her next loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":259348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Opening of a new retail outlet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T18:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Munavvarkhon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":305.34},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":316.03},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":327.09},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":338.54},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":350.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":362.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.79},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90.86},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.04},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.73},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":178.64,"local_amount":621.37,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:18:44Z","rounded_local_amount":622.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20427166},{"amount":94.04,"local_amount":327.09,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:55:52Z","rounded_local_amount":327.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27120672},{"amount":97.33,"local_amount":338.54,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":338.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015789},{"amount":100.73,"local_amount":350.38,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":350.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599526},{"amount":104.26,"local_amount":362.62,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-21T07:47:43Z","rounded_local_amount":363.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52993976}],"funded_date":"2009-02-19T02:07:55Z","paid_date":"2009-07-21T07:47:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":89099,"name":"Gulzar Allah Wasaya Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulzar Baji is a 37-year-old married lady and has resided in a city named Multan, Pakistan for the past 24 years.

Umedjon is 33 years old, married, and has three children. All of his life he has devoted to agricultural work, and on market days he brings his products to the market. For Umedjon the harvest is what he enjoys the most and he devotes a lot of time to sorting wheat, onions, watermelon and rice. \r\n\r\nAgriculture is full of satisfaction for him and his family, even more when they sell for a good price at the market. That is the motivation to continue planting. At the same time Umedjon raises cattle. \r\n\r\nThis is the 9th loan that Umedjon has with IMON International, making his payments on time. He is very grateful to those who support him, because they allow him to provide well-being to his family. With the money requested, Umedjon will buy seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants, and also cattle.       \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about IMON International's work, please visit: www.imon.tj\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":596313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing seed, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants, cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2010-09-08T12:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Umedjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":976.82},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":996.18},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1027}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":976.82},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":996.18},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1027}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.3,"local_amount":0.3,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T10:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":0.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177695983},{"amount":1.11,"local_amount":1.11,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206666245},{"amount":2107.55,"local_amount":2107.55,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2107.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211444721},{"amount":891.04,"local_amount":891.04,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T07:50:22Z","rounded_local_amount":891.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221989828}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T23:02:30Z","paid_date":"2011-08-17T07:50:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":233343,"name":"Sok","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sok M., 46, is a professional silk weaver, making US$ 2 each day in Takeo province.

She is still sad about his death, but the constant support she receives from her 3 children motivates her. She lives alone in her own home in the city of San Ram\u00f3n (in the central Peruvian rainforest). The happiness she shows is a reflection of the support she receives from her children, who built their houses around her so they could look after her. Elena makes a living selling food, vegetables and fruits, from a little space set up in her home. She has been at this business for 4 years, but as this successful woman tells us, she also has a business selling coffee and honey. She gets these products in the city of Perene, where she travels constantly, and then sells them in the country\u2019s capital. Elena\u2019s strengths are surprising because she also grows potatoes in the city of Tarma, where she travels every harvest season. She is, however, aware of her advanced age, which is why she would like to buy a knitting machine to make sweaters to sell in the city of Huancayo and La Oroya. This is her eighth MFP loan, and she is happy belonging to her communal bank, which, in her own words, \u201cis like family.\u201d Once she gets the requested loan, she will use it to buy supplies for her grocery shop and if she makes any extra money she will spend it on growing potatoes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":681177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of grocery items and to invest in growing potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":162.87},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":170.2},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":177.86},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":185.86},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":194.23},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":202.96},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":212.1},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":221.64},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":231.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":240.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.04},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.7},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.47},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.38},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.4},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.58},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.88},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.35},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":59.04,"local_amount":162.87,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:26Z","rounded_local_amount":165.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463724},{"amount":61.7,"local_amount":170.2,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:30Z","rounded_local_amount":173.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887107},{"amount":64.75,"local_amount":178.62,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:01Z","rounded_local_amount":181.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327468},{"amount":67.64,"local_amount":186.59,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":189.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196015},{"amount":69.86,"local_amount":192.74,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":196.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269699},{"amount":73.94,"local_amount":203.97,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:35Z","rounded_local_amount":207.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549704},{"amount":76.52,"local_amount":211.09,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":214.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718399},{"amount":80.35,"local_amount":221.64,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":225.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349958},{"amount":84.91,"local_amount":234.24,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":238.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850518},{"amount":86.29,"local_amount":238.04,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":242.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665764}],"funded_date":"2011-01-04T03:30:04Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":266128,"name":"Akil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This borrower is from Iraq.

She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Salde, who is 44 years old, helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 10 and 18 years old. Vivian joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1991 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 29 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vivian has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 30th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for her children's education. Vivian is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

En este clima c\u00e1lido y \u00e1rido se encuentra la casa y empresa del cliente. Luis disfruta mucho visitar a su familia y pasar momentos inolvidables en sus tiempos libres; como bien se sabe el Per\u00fa se caracteriza por tener las comidas m\u00e1s deliciosas del mundo y uno de los platos que a Luisa le gusta mucho es el \u201cPato con Tau-si\u201d.

She is very charming, and has the energy that many young people would like to have. She lives in Ica, Peru. \r\n\r\nIca is located in the Sechura Desert, around four hours south of Lima, the country's capital. It is celebrated by Peruvians as \"The Land of the Sun.\" It is known in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (one 8.0 in 2007, and 6.9 in 2011), for its production of grapes, asparagus, and olives, and perhaps especially as the source of Pisco, the traditional national drink of Peru. The home and business of the client is located in this warm and dry climate. \r\n\r\nIn her spare time, Luisa really enjoys visiting her family and having unforgetable times. As is well known, Peru is notable for having some of the best food in the world, and one of the dishes that Luisa really likes is \"Pato con Tau-si\" (duck cooked Chinese-style). \r\n\r\nShe would have really enjoyed being able to study agronomy, but due to her lack of income, she wasn't able to afford the degree she wanted so much.  But with the passage of time, she found a business opportunity that allowed her to have another livelihood. \r\n\r\nLuisa sells raspadillas (shaved ice), which is crushed ice to which a kind of sweetener is added, and chicha morada, a soft drink made from purple corn. She does this work for approximately seven hours daily. She worked with her father from a young age, and this is why she felt like having this kind of business.\r\n\r\nIn a day, Luisa can serve from 30 to 40 people, and this allows her to earn an average of approximately 55 soles daily; on a good day she can earn up to 75 soles, and this helps her with a few additional expenses. \r\n\r\nLuisa thinks her business is successful because her customers feel satisfied, and always come back to her business. Luisa is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since with the help she has been provided, she will be able to tackle a new business idea, which consists of buying fruitcakes, made from a base of sweet cake and candied fruit, to sell at her business for the Christmas season. \r\n\r\nThis improvement will help her have another product to sell, and take advantage of sales during Christmas and New Year's. She will also invest part of the loan in a few products that she needs for her raspadilla stand. This combination of effort and investment will allow Luisa to have her own shop within a few months, and fulfill her great dream, \"to have a restaurant.\"\r\n\r\n

She is a farmer who owns a small piece of land on which she cultivates rice to earn a living. In her plantation, she has some problems because her field is infertile and it is far from the irrigation system. In order to solve these problems, she decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer and gasoline. She would use the rest of money to hire a laborer to plow the field. Her husband, Mr. Chuk Touch, is a hardworking man. This couple has four children, two of whom are construction workers and the other two are attending the local school. \r\n\r\nFifteen members in this group loan have end-of-term (EoT) loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Those having EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

She is 37 years old, married, and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, Luna owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Luna has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 2,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\nIn 2009, Luna joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Luna is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her third from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":531103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 30 years old, single and does not yet have children.  She finished twelfth grade but did not continue school because of financial difficulties.  She lives in her own house with her relatives and supports two brothers who live with her.\r\n\r\nShe never left her hometown.  After she stopped studying because of financial difficulties, Clara began her own business.  She has run this business for more than seven years.  She has no employees and earns about 10,000 to 15,000 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses.  She also saves some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nClara has never had loans from other banks.  She learned about Hluvuku through her friends, who are also customers of this institution.  This is her third loan, and she is asking for 25,000 meticais.  She intends to buy clothing (pants, blouses, jackets, skirts and other items) to increase her inventory.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay off this loan on time so she can take out more loans.  Clara's dream is to attend college.  In the future she intends to ask for more loans to develop her business and become a businesswoman of renown.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The group was named this because the location where they meet is in the open and in the mornings one can appreciate the start of a new day and the rising sun. \r\n\r\nBrigida is one of the members of the group. She is 39 years old and she is married with Bernabe. She has 4 children, 2 of whom are married, and 2 are in primary school. She has been selling clothing for 2 years. She started the business because she used to get bored at home and she needed to do something to keep her occupied, so she started to sell clothing. At the start her sales were low because she only sold to her clients and family but with the passage of time her sales have been increasing. She goes out to other communities to sell her products. This business is very important to her, not only because it occupies her time but also because it helps with the school expenses of her 2 young children and with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nBrigida requests a loan to purchase more clothing. This is the season when sales are very good and she needs to have more variety. She will purchase: blouses, skirts, beach shirts, t-shirts, undergarments, pants, and hats.  She will increase the variety the products to offer her clients, as they are the most important reason why her business has been increasing. \r\n\r\nShe comments that her business has been doing very well, although there are times when it is a little quiet and there are almost no sales. But during other times she is able to recover and it has gone very well. She hopes that it will go well so that she will be able to make her payments and to help her husband with the household expenses. \r\n\r\nHer greatest dram is to see her children earn a career and to be in good health, which are the most important things in life. \r\n\r\nThe group \"Frente al Sol\" is thankful for the support granted to them and it is thanks to this that they will be able to revitalize their business and to keep it growing.

The mother of 6 plies her business in the Jinja district. She was previously involved in farming and grocery store businesses, respectively. Many low denominator people find commodities sold by these small retail enterprises much cheaper than those sold by the supermarket stores which are mushrooming up in almost every town. This, therefore, means the small retail businesses can be lucrative. However of recent, the status quo has given rise to a rising middle class. These middle class people are increasingly partial to goods sold in the supermarkets, despite the price difference. This has, however, not dampened the spirits of most retail business people, including Zulaika. Her 10 year old experience in this business is clear testimony to her hard work and determination. She, however, has never rested on her laurels. She strives day in, day out to make new plans for her business, including expansion plans. She says she still has a lot of leeway to make up to see all her plans come to fruition.\r\n\r\nMost of these retail businesses also operate on loans and the credit crunch in many respects adversely affected them. Zulaika, took this all in her stride. \r\nOn the side, she ekes out a supplementary income from a poultry sales business. On a weekly basis, she makes gross profits in the amount of Ugandan shillings 120,000. She says with this requested Kiva loan, she intends to purchase more retail commodities like sugar, salt, basins, toothpaste, beans, maize flour, rice, etc. to resell.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4250,"image":{"id":818938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more retail commodities like sugar, salt, basins, toothpaste, beans, maize flour, rice, etc to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Jinja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.583333 33.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-24T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4250,"lender_count":144,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zulaika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebecca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibra","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bairye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Halima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sirina","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hillary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petwa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":11000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1833333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1833333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1833333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1833333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":708.33,"local_amount":1833334,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1834584,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227249018},{"amount":1416.67,"local_amount":3666665.99,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T09:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3669165.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868589},{"amount":708.33,"local_amount":1833334.01,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1834584.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648427},{"amount":578.25,"local_amount":1496649,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1497669.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313776},{"amount":838.42,"local_amount":2170017,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-02T09:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2171496.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275400}],"funded_date":"2011-08-18T21:11:09Z","paid_date":"2012-03-02T09:19:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":323518,"name":"Lerma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lerma is 62 years old and is a married woman with seven adult children.

Se dedica a la venta de ropa, lo que realiza de forma ambulante por las calles, ofreciendo de puerta en puerta los diversos modelos para todas las edades. En esta actividad se ocupa todo el d\u00eda, hace m\u00e1s de 3 a\u00f1os. No le es muy dif\u00edcil vender su mercader\u00eda, puesto que con su gran simpat\u00eda ha logrado tener clientes que le hacen pedidos mensualmente. A Edelisa le agrada el ofertar sus productos, porque puede tener una gran cantidad de amigos por todos lados y eso es favorable para ella. Sin embargo, lo dificultoso es tener que lidiar con el clima, pasar horas de horas caminando en pleno sol, lo que es muy agotador. Edelisa desea invertir en la compra de mayor cantidad de mercedar\u00eda para vender en las festividades, de la misma forma, desea con el tiempo, adquirir un motocarro, ya que en la selva el transporte en moto es la mejor inversi\u00f3n."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":190797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Invest in merchandise to increase sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-08-14T02:20:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edelisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-28T13:20:58Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-09-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":257,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340547},{"amount":87,"local_amount":248.57,"processed_date":"2008-10-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-29T07:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":254.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372910},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:26:48Z","rounded_local_amount":255.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335714},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:30:01Z","rounded_local_amount":255.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9956892}],"funded_date":"2008-08-14T13:20:58Z","paid_date":"2009-01-16T01:30:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":64541,"name":"Mariam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariam  is 22 years old.

The women all live in the Bamanan Kin district of Markala (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali), and they know one another through ties of marriage and membership in the same traditional women's association in the area.  Thanks to the correct organizing of this traditional association, they've benefited through the NGO ROCAM from training in the dyeing of cloth, literacy, sanitation, and organizing micro-credit tontines banks with an interest rate of 10% a month.  This group does commerce in various goods, such as toys for children, cakes and cookies, soaps, firewood, juices for beverages, Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), etc.\r\n\r\nIn their search for supplemental financial resources, the women decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their fourth solidarity loan, after having repaid the preceding ones.  This new loan will be used to buy 28 bolts of Wax <i>pagnes<\/i>, 57 cart-loads of firewood, 2 sacks of sugar, a box of flavorings, 25 kg of dried hibiscus flowers, and 25 kg of tamarind.  \r\n\r\nThe group members resupply themselves with different goods at the grand marketplace of Bamako, from the fair vendors of Sansanding and Thien Bamanan, in Diamarabougou, and on the banks of the Niger River.  The goods are sold in an itinerant manner at the marketplace and door-to-door in Diamarabougou.  The firewood is first split and then placed into basins at home for resale to a mixed customer base. \r\n\r\nThe group members envision realizing an average monthly profit of 51,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to cover the healthcare costs for the children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Linked by married and business ties, these women sell pagnes, fruit, and grains just as Kadiatou D. does. \r\nIn order to increase her purchasing power and obtain more stock, she decided to turn to the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She is on her fifth group loan and all of the previous loans were repaid in full. \r\nMrs. Kadiatou D. sells grains in the Bougouni Grand Market. With this loan, she plans on buying 1 ton of millet, 600 kg of corn, and 700 kg of beans. She buys her stock from suppliers in the surrounding villages and then sells them retail, for cash and credit in the Bougouni market to a client base made up of both men and women. \r\nWith this loan she hopes to make a monthly profit of 15,000 FCFA which will be used to take care of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":761005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy grains.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"\tKadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\tFatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\tRokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\tMinata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\tBintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":84567.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301536},{"amount":191.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":84567.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216581117},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":84567.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750874},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":84567.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120178},{"amount":191.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":84567.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882050},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:24Z","rounded_local_amount":84567.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699145}],"funded_date":"2011-05-02T20:45:16Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Manuel Carreiro","image":null}},{"id":298946,"name":"Asuncion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Asunci\u00f3n es un se\u00f1or de 59 a\u00f1os de edad, \u00e9l vive junto a su esposa en la zona rural del distrito de La Victoria en Chiclayo.

This is her 3rd loan, she has demonstrated relatively good payment history, as she was behind in some of her payments which she attributed to the problems in the state such as civic work stoppages and

past obstacles and to improve her situation. Bahri is an extremely hard-working and energetic woman. She is 38 years old, married, and the loving mother of four children. Bahri started her own business because her husband\u2019s salary was not enough to cover their family\u2019s expenses. For more than 10 years, she has operated a store where she sells children\u2019s clothing. Her store is well-known, and people love to visit because it's clean, tidy, and run by someone who is very kind and thoughtful. Bahri hopes that her store will keep growing so that she can maintain a comfortable life for her family, especially for her children. To make that possible, she has applied for a new loan in the amount of $1000 that she will use to buy more clothing to sell. She promises to repay the loan in time and thanks everyone for supporting her.     \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Together they reside in a community located in the Cuzco rain forest, where they own their house. Sonia works with her husband, who is her partner. For some time they have engaged in the production and marketing of cocoa and coca leaf. This activity produces good income that allows them to have a good quality of life. They haven't always enjoyed economic prosperity. There were times when they went hungry because they did not have enough money, but working together they were able to get ahead. \r\n\r\nCurrently they have potential customers, and they are doing well in the marketing of natural products, due to the constant sacrifice of both her and her husband. She is proud and happy for everything that has happened. It is for this reason that every morning she goes to her farm, to care for it, usually working with her husband. At harvest time she has to hire laborers to expedite the efficient picking of cocoa and coca leaf.  Normally, she sells the products to collection centers in her community. \r\n\r\nHer future plan is to install a clothing store, since there are few stores of this type in her community, and she calculates  that it should produce a good income. This is her second loan with MFP, and she promises to comply promptly with her payments. Sonia also likes to participate actively in her communal bank, because responsibility is shared by all members.  She plans to invest the money requested in providing maintenance for her farm, buying fertilizer and manure for their respective plantings of cacao and coca leaf.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":539872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"BUYING MANURE AND FERTILIZER FOR HER FARM LAND ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-14T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2057.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886420}],"funded_date":"2010-05-15T03:36:48Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":204713,"name":"Rehema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehema has been selling her neighbors cooked food  like chapati (flat bread), beans and rice for three years.

Zamboanga del Norte. She is 57 years old, is widowed, and has 6 adult children. To make a living, Mediadora owns and operates a business venture making instant salabat (ginger tea). While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for her business comes from selling instant salabat in the local community. Mediadora has been engaged in her business for more than 30 years and earns approximately 1000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Mediadora joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used as working capital and to purchase additional inventory. This will be Mediadora's first loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
