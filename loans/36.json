N. lives in the city of Vahdat. She is 43 years old, is married and has 6 children. She has a High School education. She is self employed. She sells household items from her own house. She sells laundry detergent, soap and other cleaning supplies. This business is the main source of income for her family. Her turnover, however, is relatively small and does not allow her to increase the variety of goods she has for sale. The profit from the business is just large enough to feed her family. Shahrinisso wishes to see her business grow and generate more and more profit. For this reason she wishes to obtain a loan, which will allow her to diversify her selection of goods up for sale. In addition to that, the loan will allow her neighbors, who are also Shahrinisso's main clients, to purchase more goods  close to home without having to travel to the market. The client plans to repay the loan in a 9 months period.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur.

She lives with her husband and their children, renting in Hamdallaye, one of the districts of the city of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  After having worked in a lot of businesses unsuccessfully, she got started six years ago in this business, purchasing and selling beauty products and various items.  She works at the grand marketplace of Sikasso.  To offer a varied range of products to her customers, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program.  She has been making voluntary savings deposits at Soro Yiriwaso for two months, and she is on her first PIC (individual commercial loan).  \r\n<p>With this loan, she intends to buy 5 boxes of hair cream of different grades, 5 women's handbags, 10 coolers, 5 dozen coffee mugs, 5 boxes of bath soap, and 5 pairs of shoes.  She gets her inventory in Bamako,  Bobo Dioulasso (Republic of Burkina Faso), and often Lom\u00e9 (Republic of Togo).  With this loan, she envisions realizing a profit of 125,000 francs CFA, which will serve to cover the loan interest, to help with family expenses, and to invest in her business.  She now wants to make the most of this Soro Yiriwaso loan to become a major merchant in the marketplace where she operates, in order satisfy her customers, most of whom are women.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\nMadame Fatoumata  S. a 43 ans et m\u00e8re de cinq (5) enfants (2 gar\u00e7ons et 3 filles), vit avec son \u00e9poux et leurs enfants en location \u00e0 Hamdallaye, un des  quartiers  de la ville de Sikasso (troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative de la r\u00e9publique du Mali).

She buys and sells livestock, an activity that she has done for 10 years as part of the family business.  Five years ago, she decided to become independent and start her own business.  Fermina sells her livestock in the plaza in the district of Taraco.  Her years of experience make her carry out her job with a lot of eagerness and happiness.

O. is a 28-year-old man living in the Nyalenda neighborhood in Kisumu, Kenya with his wife and two children. George moved to Kisumu after the post-election violence in the Central Province of Kenya displaced him from his home there. He has been living in Kisumu for one year and has recently started a poultry business.<P>\r\n\r\nGeorge is a boda-boda driver, which means he is the driver of a bicycle taxi (a common, inexpensive mode of transport in Kisumu). Looking to increase his income, George wanted to start a small business that would be easy to maintain while he continued his boda-boda work. He decided on a poultry business, since after feeding and giving water to the chickens he would be free to work during the day. <P>\r\n\r\nA new member to the K-MET network, George was interested in becoming one of K-MET\u2019s Community Health Workers so that he could \u201chelp the people near him who need assistance.\u201d He also found out about K-MET\u2019s micro-finance program and is now applying for a loan of approximately 150 USD in order to expand his poultry business.<P>\r\n\r\nGeorge has 15 chickens at present and sells the eggs to his neighbors. He would like to use the loan money to purchase about 150 chickens. After expanding the number of poultry, he will be able to expand his sales, perhaps getting a stall in the local market.

years of age, is married and has commercial premises from where she buys and sells traditional women\u2019s clothing. She lives together with her 3 children and they all work together in the business, as they have done for 6 years, which is in their home on Chuipachec Place in the Juchanep region, situated in the department of Totonicapan, Guatemala. Now the demand from her customers has increased but the financial conditions in which she finds herself are not sufficient for her to be able to increase her capital. For this reason she approached the ASDIR Association to ask for a loan with the intention of buying merchandise. In this way she will be able to increase her weekly sales and also hopes to be able to offer more opportunities to her children and give them a better quality of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

When she arrived to the capital she studied but interrupted her studies when she got pregnant with her boyfriend. Her uncle turned her away saying he couldn't be responsible of her and her new born. Her life turned difficult and she was able to get a job as domestic assistant where she worked for 3 years, with the money she saved, she started her own business selling pots bought in Maputo and sold in Namaacha a village near the frontier with Suazilandia where she met her current husband who lived in that district.\r\nYears later she moved in with her husband and life and business turned easier. Today she owns a spot to sell pots at the market that works twice a week (Wednesdays and Saturdays). Thanks to Hluvuku and Kiva she has been able to travel twice a week to increase her stock. Her best pots are the numbers 1x20 and 4x20. She buys them at 120mt and 250mt and sells them at 270mt and 350mt respectively. Rosalina watched her business grow with the loans obtaining a monthly income of 7.000mt and gaining a profit of 1.000mt. Besides her two children she is responsible for her parents in law who live with her at home. She is also looking to buy furniture.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva. The first two were used to increase her business and she is requesting the third to increase the volume of her stock, she is confident she will pay it back on time and will request a new loan to build a stable store to sell her pots.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Nina Delgado, Kiva

There are many occupations that were traditionally male dominated but are now done by women. Dilfuza\u2019s is an example.\r\n\r\nDilfuza has been farming cattle for the past five years. Her earnings even surpassed her husband's who works as a farmer. Dilfuza, with the support of her daughter (pictured), is doing well in her business. With a loan from IMON International she expects to buy young cattle. She really hopes that she can produce more cows to be sold so she earns more than last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She and her husband have worked very hard to raise their big family. Despite the many hardships she encountered, she was able to send all of their eight children to school.<p>\r\nShe joined Ahon SA Hirap Inc.

For almost eight years in ASHI, she has shown good performance, so she is being trusted by the institution for further loans.<p>\r\nShe runs a variety store with a little <i>carenderia<\/i> (stall selling foods ready to eat). She started her variety store based on her idea of dealing with customers. Her business is growing because the members of the community in her neighborhood like her products and find what they need in her store instead of going to other places. She is requesting a loan of 40,000 Philippine pesos as her eleventh loan from ASHI to pay for items including sacks of rice, white sugar, washed sugar, brown sugar, cigarettes, canned goods, candies, soft drinks, and cooking oil.<p>\r\nShe dreams of growing her variety store into a mini-grocery store. Her children are her motivation to continue in her business. She dreams of sending her children to school and hopes that they will complete a degree in college. Iluminada now feels very happy about her work and the service of ASHI and Kiva.

He lives in a town called El Torno. El Torno is the fourth municipal section of the province of Santi Iva\u00f1ez, of the  Departament of Santa Cruz. It is divided into four cantons with 65 farming communities. According to the last census from 2002, the town of El Torno has 40,000 inhabitants.  It is a young population, made up of migrants from the country's interior. From the west, Quechuas and Aymaras; from the east, and also people native to the area. \r\n\r\nIn Santa Cruz there are large social differences that inhabit the same space. Next to the great \"quintas\", the properties of landholders and people with bigger purchasing power in Santa Cruz, live the residents of the area themselves. They live in houses that are mainly of simple construction (adobe and roofs thatched with palm).   There is a difference between the towns of Santa Rita and Santa Marta 1 and Santa Marta 2. These are found next to the old highway to Cochabamba. There you will find homes made of brick and tile next to the simplest homes. The farming communities are towards the mountains' interior. These are all made of adobe and thatch and of much humbler conditions. Water and electricity services aren't available there.  \r\n\r\nThese towns are at a distance of between 5 and 20 kilometers from the interior (the pastoral area that volunteers must attend). This pastoral area is made up of 9 communities, accessed by dirt roads on which wagons sometimes pass to be able to access them.  The town's economy is based on fish farming and fruit growing. It is also based on the extraction of stone, gravel and sand from the Pira\u00ed river that encircles the town. There is also a lot of commerce, especially in the town of El Torno, where there is a market where agricultural workers' products are sold.   \r\n\r\nJaime Has been working with EMPRENDER for 2 years. The first loan was to buy a lot of land in the town of San Luis. He has been working this land and is in the process of buying 2 more hectares. With the money from the loan, he will buy seed to plant potatoes and later sell them in the area market. He expects to pay off this loan and take out a larger one.  He is very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the confidence they have in him in granting him this loan.  \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":507499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy seed to plant potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime Alcides \t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151879804},{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172100780},{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188668632},{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201272985}],"funded_date":"2010-04-11T23:03:06Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:51:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":189386,"name":"Dina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dina is 54 years old and is married with four children who are 16, 18, 21 and 23 years old.

E. is from the village of Tinago, Ozamis City, Misamis Occidental. She is 44 years old. Lolita is married and has 2 adult and 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Lolita owns and operates a general retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of goods in the local community. She just started this business.\r\n\r\n In 2006, Lolita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC. Lolita is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used as additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Lolita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of the her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He is married and has 4 children.  Kahramon has a high school education.  He has been purchasing and selling livestock for more than 8 years.  He purchases and sells livestock at the local market, at neighboring markets and sometimes in Uzbekistan.  He earns an additional income from farming where he also gets feed for his livestock.<p>  \r\n\r\nEvery year, in the spring, Kahramon sells his winter livestock and spends half the proceeds to purchase wheat seeds and the other half he spends on new livestock to fatten.  Kahramon has a big yard for livestock and during the day he and his neighbors give their livestock to a shepherd that takes it out to feed in the fields and mountains of Shahristan.  One head of livestock costs 1 somoni per day and the shepherd is responsible for the livestock.  Kahramon and his family work in farming and he will use his loan to purchase a new type of feed for his livestock.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>

He studied through the 5th grade but had to stop as his parents could not continue to afford the costs of his studies. His elderly mother lives with his family. Jorge is a civil servant that has worked at the Boane Institute of Agriculture for the past 12 years where he receives a monthly salary of 2,650.00MT. With his salary he is able to support his family and save a little bit to use in times of crisis.\r\n\r\nJorge has received loans from other institutions that operate in the area. The first loan was for 2,000.00MT and the second was for 3,000.00MT and were both taken out as group loans. He says that he first learned about Hluvuku-Adsema through colleagues and friends after  he opened offices in this part of the Maputo province. He likes Hluvuku-Adsema because he can take out personal loans (as opposed to group loans) of relatively larger amounts. He has previously taken out loans of 5,200.00 MT and 7,800.00MT. This will be his third loan with Hluvuku-Adsema and his first with Kiva with the amount being 10,000.00MT. Jorge is building his house in phases and hopes to complete construction soon so that he can realize his dream of opening a mini market with various products.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She then expanded it into a \"carinderia\" - a small eatery that sold cooked food to her neighbors. After she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 she used her loans to improve her business, expanding her operations to sell groceries and other goods that her neighbors might need - almost like a 7\/11 store.\n\nElizabeth also used the loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon to improve the construction of her store which was originally built from bamboo and other light materials. She slowly reinforced the building using hollow blocks and cement for a more permanent structure. The income from her business enables her to continue fixing and improving her house as well as pay for the education of her two young children.\n\nNow on her 15th loan, Elizabeth is borrowing PHP 19,500 so that she can restock her convenience store and have more working capital to use in her eatery business.\n\n\nAbout NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

She has always been a merchant and 15 years ago she started a prepared meals business based on wheat-flour items like: empanaditas (little turnovers, deditos (a type of fried snack), and various types of rolls.  As time went by, she added other commercial activities, like catalogue merchandise sales.  Seven years ago she added shoe sales.  With her fast-food business, she now has a total of three.  Recently, Petrona decided to abandon her fast-food business because the heat started to affect her hands.  Now she is involved in tutoring children and to provide room and board for persons who come from other cities to study in Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nHer school children tutoring services are from 2-6pm when they get out of school; her daughter participates in this activity.  Since she owns her own home, she can rent space to students from other places and this room and board service is an additional source of income for her and her daughter.\r\n\r\nShe is asking the foundation for a loan, valued at $1.000.000, to invest in this last commercial activity; specifically, to make home improvements.  She will fill in the patio in order to redirect rainwater drainage, install flooring and a wash stand for laundry and will purchase gutters.\r\n\r\nPetrona has been associated with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for 5 years and has had 7 loans during this time frame.  She feels that they have made it possible for her to pay for her daughter\u2019s education as a Systems Engineer and that her being able to study this career was due to the foundation\u2019s help.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges she and her daughter have faced, like times of low sales and the physical and time limitations they have because they live alone, she has managed to get ahead and now dreams with finishing her house and having income that will provide her with much stability in every sense of the word.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She is starting a business planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Tupelele needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 talas or US $50 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tupelele joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Tupelele's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

It has 5 female members who know each other and are neighbors.  They are Sara J.

J., who will buy shoes to fill an order; Elizabeth Mart\u00ednez T., who will buy cosmetics and shoes to fill her orders; Mar\u00eda del Refugio T. M., who will buy manure to fertilize her irrigated fields and Claudia B. E. who will buy sugar, yoghurt, cheese and soft drinks to stock her business.\r\n\r\nClaudia B. E. is 35 years old and studied up to the third year of high school.  She is married and doesn't have any children.  She has a games machine business.  Claudia has requested her loan so that she can start stocking a grocery store.  She will buy sausages, ham, yoghurt, A\u00f1ejo cheese, Oaxaca cheese and soft drinks.  She will also buy paint so that she can paint her home.\r\n\r\nClaudia started her business a year ago as her household needed more income.  She has her games machines on commission and earns a percentage.  She used to sell 'picaditas' (filled cornmeal shells) and 'dobladitas' (a kind of quick bread).  She would like to go back to selling 'picaditas' and 'dobladitas'.  Her business is important because it makes her income.  She has money so that she doesn't want for anything, her business is located in her home and she doesn't pay rent.  Her customers are the children who come to play on the machines.  Her business has competition from another person who has games machines.\r\n\r\nClaudia uses the profits from her business to buy food.  She is planning to expand her business, set up her grocery store and sell 'picaditas' and 'dobladitas'.  She hopes to use her loans to achieve this.  Her business has helped her financially.  The improvements she would like to make to her home are to put down flooring, buy some stools and remodel her water tank.  Her hopes are to grow her business and to put down flooring in her home.\r\n\r\nClaudia is happy to be receiving this loan which she has been given so that her business can grow and become well known.   The members of the group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Many thanks for your help.  Please lower the interest rates so that we can manage and so that all is well.

She has more than 5 years of experience in this field, and she would like to increase her working capital in order to enlarge her business. She is married and has children.\r\n\r\nMs. T. is a beneficiary of the agreement between U-IMCEC (one of Kiva's field partners) and the Program for the Development of Children and Families (PDEF in French) Seydina Issa Laye. The PDEF seeks to reduce poverty within the community, and especially to protect children who come from destitute families. Thanks to this cooperation, the parents of these children can benefit from loans having more flexible terms, as compared to ordinary loans. Since the agreement's inception in December 2008, 120 parents have received financing in amounts varying from 50,000 to 150,000 francs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Rosina has 1 year of experience in this business.  Rosina needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Rosina joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Rosina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

In the mountain region, most people work in the field because they learn from generation to generation.  When she had her children, she continued with this work and since then she has planted corn and peas. These are products that have a high price in the domestic market. At present, although she is not supporting anyone, she keeps planting. Her children suggested she should rest after so many years of work, but Maximiliana really likes to work the land.  She says that she is used to waking up every day at dawn to care for her green fields. She has a lot of plans for the future.

sustento de sus hijas. Se dedica principalmente a la comercializaci\u00f3n de animales: todos los mi\u00e9rcoles viaja hacia los caser\u00edos de la zona y compra aves de corral (patos, pavos) que luego vende a los comerciantes de carne del mercado de la ciudad. Ella sacrifica a las aves y las vende listas para ser comercializadas. Este negocio es la principal fuente de ingreso econ\u00f3mico de su familia.\n\nDe otro lado se dedica a la preparaci\u00f3n y venta de vino. Empez\u00f3 en este negocio hace dos a\u00f1os gracias a que una de sus hijas aprendi\u00f3 el oficio en el colegio donde estudiaba. Marcela fermenta la bebida en baldes de pl\u00e1stico y las ofrece en venta a sus vecinos y conocidos.\n\nMarcela ya ha trabajado anteriormente con Kiva y con el pr\u00e9stamo que se le otorg\u00f3 anteriormente pudo hacer progresar su negocio y aumentar sus ventas, ahora se mantiene viajando constantemente a los caser\u00edos para adquirir animales y seguir comercializ\u00e1ndolos. La necesidad de agenciarse de nuevos ingresos que le permitan sacar adelante a sus hijas ha hecho que solicite nuevamente a EdpymeAlternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 2000 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en la adquisici\u00f3n de mas animales para ampliar sus ventas y percibir mayores ganancias.\n\nElla es una madre que siempre da todo de s\u00ed para sacar a sus hijas adelante. Su m\u00e1s grande anhelo es ver a su dos hijas convertidas en profesionales exitosas. En el pr\u00e9stamo anterior ella ha demostrado puntualidad y responsabilidad al momento de asumir sus pagos\n\n","en":"Marcela is 43, separated  and lives with her two daughters ages 14 and 18 in the San Martin area of the city of Lambayeque, about 20 minutes from the city of Chiclayo. Separating from her husband drove her to to work to maintain her daughters.\r\n\r\nShe makes a living mainly through selling animals. Every Wednesday she travels to the rural communities in the area and buys poultry (ducks, turkeys) that she then resells to the meat sellers in the city market. She butchers the animals herself and sells them ready for resale. This business is her main source of income.\r\n\r\nAnother business is making and selling wine. She started this business two years ago thanks to the fact that her daughter learned the process in high school. Marcela ferments the beverage in plastic buckets and then sells it to neighbors and acquaintances. \r\n\r\nMarcela has worked with Kiva before, her last loan helped build her business and increase her sales. Today she travels constantly to the rural communities to buy animals and resell them. Her need to increase her income to help her daughters succeed is why she is requesting and loan of 2000 Nuevos Soles through Edpyme Alternativa, to invest in the purchase of more animals to increase her sales. \r\n\r\nShe is mother who always gives everything to help her daughters succeed. Her greatest wish is to see her two daughters become successful professionals. She has shown punctuality and responsibility in the repayment of her previous loan. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Solson Scherman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":466497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase animals for resale to the local market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-06-22T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":306.46},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":314.84},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":330.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":338.2},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":349.48},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":360.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.09},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.13},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.6},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.68},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":111.09,"local_amount":306.46,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":313.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878372},{"amount":114.13,"local_amount":314.84,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":322.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618406},{"amount":119.69,"local_amount":330.17,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:15Z","rounded_local_amount":338.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832801},{"amount":380.09,"local_amount":1048.53,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1074.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099405}],"funded_date":"2010-06-22T20:42:55Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":213999,"name":"Motuli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Motuli L. is 38 and married with three children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 57 years old and widowed. Having raised 6 children of her own, she now cares for her four orphaned grandchildren who have lost their parents - her children- to AIDS.

Married with only one school-age child, Liezel is determined to provide for her family since her husband is unemployed.\r\n<p>\r\nShe joined NWTF-Project Dungganon five years ago to start her business selling condiments and vegetables in her community. She is grateful that NWTF took a chance with her in spite of her age, and helped her start her business and guided her on how to handle her finances and how to plan on the expansion of her business. With the help of her husband, all her efforts and tireless determination have paid off as the business now earns PHP 10,000 per month - enough to support their family.\r\n<p>\r\nThis new loan of PHP 20,000 is Liezel's 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and she plans to use it as rolling capital so that she could buy more produce from the farms to sell to her community.\r\n<p>\r\nLiezel is shown in the photo with boxes of farm-fresh tomatoes and onions ready for transport to her food stall in the market.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

She does her buying in  Dantokpa, international market of B\u00e9nin, and in Lom\u00e8, the capital of Togo, a country which borders on B\u00e9nin. <P>\r\n\r\nPrisca is a long-time client of ALID\u00e9's, having already received two loans that were correctly reimbursed. With a view to expanding her business and satisfying the needs of her ever-growing clientele, Prisca is requesting a third loan from ALID\u00e9. Prisca dreams of opening her own shop later on, where she can sell her merchandise. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":414389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buying 3 dozen pairs of shoes, a dozen bags, and 5 lengths of cloth","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-10-26T19:40:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.56,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Prisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":17258.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735981},{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:28:52Z","rounded_local_amount":17258.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623492},{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:02Z","rounded_local_amount":17258.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118020197},{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":17258.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858690},{"amount":39.98,"local_amount":16833.32,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-27T23:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":17431.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130495000},{"amount":39.1,"local_amount":16700,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":17293.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.56,"payment_id":136618839},{"amount":79.32,"local_amount":33400,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":34586.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151834927},{"amount":79.32,"local_amount":33400,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":34586.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166953778},{"amount":39.66,"local_amount":16700,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-29T09:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":17293.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055479},{"amount":38.74,"local_amount":16300,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":16878.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347058}],"funded_date":"2009-10-26T23:13:19Z","paid_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":151839,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine is a 60 year married woman with three children between the ages of 37 and 40.

Her business started to grow and she began selling grains from the basic food basket because her customers were asking for them. She sells corn, sugar, eggs sodas and ice cream. She is requesting a loan because she wants to take advantage of the fact that in these past months she has been able to purchase greater quantities since people are buying a lot of corn and sodas. She travels weekly to the capital to buy corn, sugar and eggs; the sodas she can buy from a delivery truck.

Five years ago, she got the idea to start raising cattle to contribute to the family finances, taking advantage of the space she had available on their land for this business. \r\n\r\nMuhaiyo is engaged in this business together with her husband. Slowly the number of cows increased and with them, her clients started asking for more and more.

Be an important part of the growth of Muhaiyo\u2019s business.   \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

This group is made up of 10 humble women with good intentions. All of them are neighbors in this area. They all work in trade, most embroider napkins and Nahua (dresses), and are hardworking and responsible women.\r\n\r\nThe representative of this group is Lucia J. A., 49 years old and married to Marcelino Garcia L\u00f3pez who is a police officer. They have 8 children, 6 of which live with them. Lucia studied only through primary school. \r\n\r\nLucia is requesting a loan to buy thread to make napkins. She uses the following: white linen, silk thread, cord, etc. In addition to embroidery she also sells chicken, so with the remainder of the loan she will buy chickens. \r\n\r\nLucia has been in this business for 10 years and has learned to make the products from taking a course. She doesn't have a central spot where she sells the napkins, but she brings them to the surrounding communities to sell. Her products are different sizes and vary in price according to the type of thread she uses and the size. She sells products for any where from 20 pesos to 200 pesos. \r\n\r\nPreviously she belonged to a group called \"Sangre India\" where together with other women they made the fabric of the napkins and had a person who collected and sold their products nationally, but as time went by the group broke up and now everyone sells their own products.\r\n\r\nWith the income she receives from sales, Lucia invests in a musical group called \"Santiago\" in which her youngest son plays the drums.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is for her work to be recognized worldwide, that people from abroad will to buy her products, and with great effort and dedication she can achieve this. \r\n\r\nShe feels very happy to receive this loan and thanks the foundation for providing people like her with loans.\r\n\r\nThe women that make up this group are the following:\r\n\r\nAndrea M. A.: 59 years old and sells Regional Snacks.\r\nCarmen V. L.: 41 years old and works making pastries.\r\nCenorina L. X: 40 years old and buys thread to make napkins.\r\nGuadalupe J.

She sells on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesday, and she she also makes and sells tamales once a week.\r\n\r\nMaria Basilisa needs this loan to invest in buying different types of chiles, biscuits, sugar, salt, pumpkin seeds, bananas, chocolates, sesame seeds, oil, tortillas, garlic, onions, and tomatoes to make the mole paste and then go out and sell it.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Maria hopes this loan will help her business to prospser so she can support her daughter to get more education and so she can give her family a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":824408,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"sell mole and tamales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-13T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Basilisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2408.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201932},{"amount":300,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3612.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807524},{"amount":200,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2408.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618618},{"amount":200,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2408.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572861},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1204.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784647}],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T16:45:09Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ross Forman","image":1172721}},{"id":328762,"name":"Luis Alejandro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la parroquia Ayacucho del cant\u00f3n Santa Ana, lugar conocido por sus hermosos balnearios de agua dulce que son un gran atractivo tur\u00edstico del cant\u00f3n y la provincia misma, all\u00ed se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas el Banco Comunal Damas de Agua Fr\u00eda.\n\nEn este lugar vive el Se\u00f1or Luis, tiene 22 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casado pero aun no tiene hijos.

She is married to a driver and has two children, ages 31 and 28 years old. Her parents gave her to an aunt at the age of 5 to be taken care of, but her aunt's husband would not allow a girl child to attend school. They were business people; therefore, they introduced her to business. After she fully matured, she got married and started working on her own business.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, Kadiatu established a rice and palm oil business. Her suppliers are located in Freetown and Makeni. She transports her items by public vehicle and she buys her stock twice a month. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about 1,413,600 leones (SLL) every month from this business. Her challenges are limited capital to buy more stock and fluctuation in foreign currency. Competition is high, but what makes her different from her competitors is that those who keep their business with her store buy more from her. She serves ten customers each day. Her business is popular because of good customer service.  \r\n\r\nKadiatu would like a loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL. Kadiatu has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy the following items: Indian rice (15 bags @ 152,000 SLL) and American rice (11 bags @ 145,000 SLL). The remaining 125,000 SLL will be used for transport. Kadiatu hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 2,827,200 SLL. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Kadiatu plans to build a house for her children. She feels good about taking this loan, because she will earn more income. This loan will help her to improve the business. She will plough back her profits into the business. Kadiatu is planning to expand and this can be accomplished through adequate utilization of her capital. She is hardworking and honest.

In the future, Valentina hopes to invest further in her transportation business and buy her own vans rather than having to rent. Valentina is married with two children in their twenties. Her son is married and is soon to have Valentina\u2019s second grandchild.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Valentina has requested a loan of $1200 to help purchase warm winter coats to sell in her clothing business. She has been an excellent client with Nadiya Ukraine in the past. We are happy to continue helping her with her businesses and look forward to seeing how they develop in the future.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":118930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase cold weather inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Pavlograd","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"48.516667 35.866667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2008-01-23T17:35:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-08T06:14:24Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":6072,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1012},{"due_date":"2008-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1012},{"due_date":"2008-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1012},{"due_date":"2008-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1012},{"due_date":"2008-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1012},{"due_date":"2008-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1012}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":1012,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-29T09:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144745},{"amount":200,"local_amount":1012,"processed_date":"2008-03-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-29T09:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":168431},{"amount":200,"local_amount":1012,"processed_date":"2008-04-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-29T09:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195190},{"amount":200,"local_amount":1012,"processed_date":"2008-05-29T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-29T09:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222389},{"amount":200,"local_amount":1012,"processed_date":"2008-06-29T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-29T09:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251620},{"amount":200,"local_amount":1012,"processed_date":"2008-07-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-29T09:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":280373}],"funded_date":"2008-01-25T06:14:24Z","paid_date":"2008-07-29T09:04:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":37001,"name":"Kyerinda West A Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The group leader of this small group is Zainabu B..

Ma-ao, Bago City, Negros Occidental, is a 62-year-old widow with six grown children. She has been sewing clothes for a living for almost 40 years and at present nets a profit of PHP 3,000 per month.\r\n\r\nDespite her senior citizenship, Julieta says that she is grateful that the Lord God still gives her the strength to continue her tailoring business. And through the help and guidance of  NWTF-Project Dungganon, which she considers as her second home because of the support and trust that the people there give her in spite of her age, she is confident that she can still contribute to the community by sewing clothes for her neighbors, and in turn stay independent by earning her own living.\r\n\r\nJulieta is borrowing PHP 9,500 for her 10th loan cycle from NWTF so that she could buy fabrics and other sewing materials for her business.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women.

Anasthasie gets her supplies in Dantokpa, international market of Benin, and she has been in this business for three years. \r\n\r\nAnasthasie has already received three loans from ALID\u00e9, loans which she has fully repaid. Anasthasie's clientele grows every day, and she is no longer able to satisfy everyone's needs. In order to increase her working capital and raise the level of her business, Anasthasie is seeking a fourth loan from ALID\u00e9.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robin Clochard, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":479495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of corn, sugar, and milk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-01-29T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anasthasie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123859122},{"amount":78,"local_amount":36000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-27T23:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":36498.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130495186},{"amount":26,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":12166.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136619263},{"amount":21.67,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:32:07Z","rounded_local_amount":10138.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835279},{"amount":4.33,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2027.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575669},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T07:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954179},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-28T09:51:53Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055838},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347377},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482504},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617351}],"funded_date":"2010-01-29T21:37:36Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robin Clochard","image":830278}},{"id":176788,"name":"Elsie Ratiza Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsie R. is from the village of Bato, Plaridel.

De esta manera comercializa su producto terminado con clientes que ella consigue directamente, a trav\u00e9s de su esposo o por referidos. Antes de entrar a la Fundaci\u00f3n ella tenia problemas de liquidez que gradualmente ha superado y   porque su capital se encontraba en las cuentas por cobrar de los clientes, estaba en ese entonces su negocio estancado, pero con los cr\u00e9ditos pudo despegar, as\u00ed fue como al   recibir su segundo financiamiento,  logro activar su comercializaci\u00f3n y consigui\u00f3 nuevas posibilidades de inversi\u00f3n. En la actualidad rota sus cuentas por cobrar entre 12 y 30 meses y su c\u00f3nyuge se dedica por completo a la administraci\u00f3n del negocio, mientras ella como es educadora lo apoya parte del tiempo en ello.\nA nivel familiar su meta principal es  continuar apoyado la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos y abrir un punto de venta para ser atendido tambi\u00e9n por su esposo. Su desaf\u00edo  mas importante  se presenta,   cuando da largos plazos a los pagos de  sus clientes  y se han presentado algunos problemas  en su recuperaci\u00f3n pero se asegura de recupera por o menos la inversi\u00f3n.\nIvon su c\u00f3nyuge y su familia son personas muy felices ; su negocio esta ubicado en el centro del municipio de  Malambo a dos calles del parque de la cultura;   donde es muy com\u00fan utilizar el sistema de cr\u00e9dito puerta a puerta como ellos lo hacen.\n\n","en":"In her work as a teacher of biology and chemistry, and with help from her husband, Ivon C. P., an independent accountant, she has gotten together enough money to set up a business making wood furniture, Muebles J. y A.  The Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo has helped the business for over three years.  \r\n\r\nShe is now requesting a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n for $2,000,000 COP.  The loan is to buy raw materials like medium density fiber boards to make ordered modular furniture and to pay for the labor.\r\n\r\nIvon says that at first she only worked at selling the modular furniture and other wood products.  Little by little its profitability made her think of a better alternative.  Now she designs the requested furniture.  She buys the raw material and takes it to shops where she pays for the labor.  She gives them a down payment so that they start the work.  When the product is done, she pays the remaining balance.\r\n\r\nThis way she sells her final product to customers she gets directly from her husband or from referrals. \r\n\r\nBefore working with the Fundaci\u00f3n, she had liquidity problems which she has gradually overcome.  She also encountered problems with the customers\u2019 bills.  At that time her business was stalled.  But, with the loans she was able to take off.  \r\n\r\nUpon receiving her second loan, her sales were stimulated, and she got new investment possibilities.  She rotates her accounts charging between 12 and 30 months.  Her husband devotes himself completely to the administration of the business.  Meanwhile, as a teacher, she helps him with the business part of the time.\r\n\r\nOn the family level, her goal is to continue supporting her children\u2019s education, and to open a spot where her husband can sell also.  Her most important challenge is when she gives customers a long time to pay.

The zone where she lives is 45 minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor the last three years she has been raising small farm animals to sell.  She raises sheep and goat outdoors in a pasture she has.  There they feed on algarroba (fruit of the carob tree which is abundant in the area) and various grasses.  When they reach their maximum level of development she sells them to the general public at the Moshoqueque Market.  This activity is her only source of income so she does her best to maintain her business.\r\n\r\nRosa wants to buy nutritionally balanced animal feed to complement their nutrition so that she will get higher earnings at the time they are sold.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Most of the population makes Ocoshal crafts and use the shrub pine as raw material.  For seven years she has been making Ocoshal crafts and growing avocados.  At harvest time she and her husband cut down the fruit and take it to the city of Toluca for sale at the wholesale market.  There they can get a very good price for their produce, which lets them give their children a better quality of life.

He is happily married and, together with his wife, has a lovely family. Daniel's primary sources of income are milk and some personal business he engages in to make ends meet. He has managed to take care of his family with his income from selling different varieties of food crops. The Kitale area has conditions that favor poultry farming. \n\nDaniel has always wanted to start poultry farming, but the lack of capital has prevented him. He is seeking a loan to buy poultry. With this loan he will be able to satisfy the ready market in his region. Demand for poultry in the Kitale area is high but the supply is low. So, through this loan, Daniel is going to comfortably meet the demand. \n\nHis increased income will allow Daniel to provide a secure future for his school-going children by paying their tuition fees.
