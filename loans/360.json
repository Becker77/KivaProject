Ergashjon is seamstress by profession. Being in this kind of business for along time, she is well known and her dresses are always in good demand at the market. Her husband (who is pictured in the photo) helps her with the business and usually sells dresses at the market, while Ergashjon is always busy fulfilling orders from her customers. Ergashjon has utilized microfinance loans from IMON Interantional to accomplish this development, repaying each with a perfect credit history. Ergashjon\u2019s business is the sole source of income for her family. Currently, she is seeking a loan of 2000 Somoni (600 USD) to increase her clothing inventory, allowing her to increase her profits and provide a higher standard of living for her family.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":270902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She is a 27-year-old mother of three children and lives with her partner. With the confidence and optimism that has always characterized her, she started her own business selling snacks on the the third floor of the municipal building in Tarapoto, where she has a well-conditioned place to serve her customers. She has made a living in this type of business for a number of years and is very satisfied with what she has achieved since it has gone very well. Currently, despite the passage of time, she continues working with the same business and relies on a faithful customer base. Her main clients are people who work in the building where she daily takes up her post and whom she tends to with the charisma she's known for. With the loan of 2,000, she plans to purchase snacks such as, different kinds of packaged cookies, chifles (fried banana slices covered in caramel), and various chocolates, to increase her supplies and better serve her customers.

He lives in a house through an \u201canticretico\u201d arrangement (in which the property owner pawns the house to the occupant).  Gerson is married and has two young children.  He works in the transportation sector, but also has a second job in construction since his transport business is not stable.  His wife Sra. Magdalena looks after their children so that he can work in the early hours until late into the night to support their family.  \n\nGerson is a responsible, dynamic, and hardworking person who puts in tremendous effort to improve the quality of life for his family.  He will use this loan to repair and perform maintenance on his vehicle in order to offer better service to his clients.

While each member receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if she is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Juana P.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nJuana is married to Generoso P. who is a driver who earns an average income of not less than P170.00. They are blessed with eight children, five of whom are already married, one is single and two are in their teens. To help her husband, she decided to engage in micro-business particularly in snack vending and RTW (GTY products) dealing activity.

In spite of her limitations, she was able to pay for her children's university studies since her dedication to her work of sowing potato, 'olluco' (a native root crop), barley and oats (agricultural products), provided her with good profits.  Currently her harvests are in very high demand in the town's central market and, as the fighter she is, during the growing seasons she travels to the cities of Lima and Chanchamayo to offer her tuber crops wholesale.  However, since the growing seasons don't last all year, this hard-working woman buys vegetables to sell in the market in the city of Mazamari.  In the future, she is planning to expand her farm with animals such as guinea pigs, cows and rams.  This is her tenth loan with MFP and during all this time she has been recognized as a responsible person.  For this reason she holds an important position in her work group.  With this loan she will buy 25 sacks of fertilizer since she will begin to sow her crops this month."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":634053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy 25 sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-07T02:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2514.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349797}],"funded_date":"2010-11-07T13:28:38Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":249403,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The mother of three children, Rosa lives in the Hato Mayor region of the Dominican Republic, located in the east of the country.

This hard-working youth works hard to help her parents. A year ago she started studying baking. She learned to make all kinds of cakes and pastries, which she sells to different stores in the area, as her school has agreements with various shopping centers. Every day she makes her desserts from 6 pm to 9 pm. She makes a regular income from the sales, and is thus very satisfied. She has various customers who are requesting buffets (varied snacks) that she also prepares at good prices. As she is a hard-working youth, she plans to open a cake and snack business in the future, where she will sell wholesale. This way, she hopes to continue progressing. This is her first loan with MFP and she promises to pay her quotas punctually as she does not want to disappoint those who are making this loan possible. This loan will allow her to continue working in the search of progress. Rossy plans to invest the requested loan in the wholesale purchase of ingredients (such as flour, oil and butter) which she needs. This way, she hopes to continue working."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":680138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase ingredients for the making of snacks and cakes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-28T15:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rossy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":70.85},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80.46},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82.8},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88.52},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.18},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.12},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.29},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":28.34,"local_amount":70.85,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":79.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887084},{"amount":32.18,"local_amount":80.46,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":90.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327445},{"amount":33.12,"local_amount":82.8,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":92.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195992},{"amount":34.29,"local_amount":85.71,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:10Z","rounded_local_amount":95.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269677},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":88.52,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":99.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549679},{"amount":36.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":102.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718385}],"funded_date":"2010-12-28T16:12:16Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":265788,"name":"Rev-Marcelline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Marcelline owns a business selling fruits, like yellow bananas.

Yadira is a woman who likes to work, so she decided to set up her own carbonated drink and beverage business in a kiosk on the third floor of the Provincial Municipality of the City of Tarapoto. She manages the business herself, without having a fixed work schedule or a boss. She states that she started out with 300.00 PEN and bought three crates of soft drinks.

She currently has the same business and is well-known by her customers, the same workers and people who go to the municipality to fill out paperwork. With this 2,000.00 PEN, she will purchase more drinks, such as different flavors, brands, and sizes of soft drinks, as well as carbonated\/non-carbonated mineral water.

He is a businessman dealing in the sale of clothes, maize, and beans from Namulesa; for 8 years he has been dealing in all the businesses. <P>\r\n\r\nThe main challenge that Paul faces,especially with his clothes business, is that some customers take the goods on credit and fail to pay hence having a bad effect on his cash flow. On average, Paul makes 90,000\/= as weekly profits and one of his strong points is that he is a trustworthy person with a strong drive to invest more into his businesses. <P>\r\n\r\nPaul hopes to construct a house for his family so that they can stop renting. He needs a loan to help buy  20 more bags of maize for resale since this will help expand his stock in that business.

He earns his living by operating a used clothing sales business. \r\n\r\nArvin joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because he aspired for something better for his family. With the help of his past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Arvin has been incrementally lifting his family out of poverty by the sweat of his brow. His previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped him earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, increasing the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for his 13th loan, he is borrowing PHP 20,000, which he intends to use to purchase stocks of clothes to sell so that he can continue to save up for the future expansion of his business. \r\n\r\nArvin A. is a Dungganon man who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of his dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

From the time that she was very young she started to become independent and provide constant support to her parents.  She lives with her parents along with her two siblings Robert and Jessenia.  Her parents taught her to farm, and when she was a child she used to work with them during long days in the fields.  When she finished her secondary education she traveled to the city of Tarma to study in a private institution to become a pharmacist.  Now she is lacking only a little coursework to finish that degree.  But at the moment she is devoting her time to helping her father, since her mother was in an accident that left her bedridden and unable to work.  It was because of this that a year ago, she took on added family responsibilities. Even though it pained her to leave her studies, she feels happy to be once again working in the fields and helping her family economically.  She mainly cultivates large quantities of potatoes on 3 plots of land that she has, and she manages to produce 2 harvests a year.  Since with each cultivation cycle she can produce up to 200 sacks of potatoes on average, she wants to work very hard so that she can provide for her family and return to finish her education.

They call themselves Las Rosas (the Roses). In the group are three men and two women. They are hardworking and, above all, enterprising. The name was chosen by Sra. Patricia who is the group\u2019s representative. It happened when she saw the beautiful roses growing in her garden and they caught her attention. Patricia is 35 years old and single; she doesn\u2019t have any children and lives with her parents at the moment.\r\n\r\nPatricia sells Ranchando novelty items. She walks from town to town and sells in the plazas three times a week. She\u2019s been doing this for eight years. The only problem she has is when it rains, she gets wet and cannot sell her wares. On occasion sales are low, but she says that it\u2019s normal: sometimes they\u2019re low, sometimes they\u2019re high.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to buy ear-rings, hair bobbles, shoe laces, plates, hair elastics, yarn to make hair accessories, bobby pins, nail files, brushes, combs etc. Her goal is to have her own house one day as at the moment she lives with her parents.Another goal is to see her business thrive.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group plan to do different things with their share of the loan. Sr. Modesto will buy manure for his nopal (prickly pear) crop. Magdaleno will buy novelty items. Eleuteria will buy pins and ear-rings. Pascual will buy novelty items.\r\n\r\nThey are very grateful for the loan and the simple repayment conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":899716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy ear-rings, hair bobbles, shoe laces, hair elastics, elastics etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-11-02T16:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eleuteria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdaleno","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pascual","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3644.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3870.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4036.4},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4499},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4702.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":269.71},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":286.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":298.7},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":314.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":332.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":269.71,"local_amount":3644.74,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3644.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573293},{"amount":394.77,"local_amount":5334.73,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5334.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785005},{"amount":270.33,"local_amount":3653.15,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3653.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193568},{"amount":289,"local_amount":3905.4,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3905.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263329938},{"amount":304.06,"local_amount":4108.93,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4109.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044016},{"amount":322.13,"local_amount":4353.05,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4353.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656333}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T15:42:52Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":355995,"name":"Juan Pablo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan vive con su esposa y un hijo, es agricultor y ganadero, los negocios los aprendio por su pap\u00e1 quien siempre se a dedicado a la agricultura y la ganader\u00eda, tiene experiencia en los negocios y no cuenta con un horario establecido de trabajo ya que trabaja solo y en lo propio.\nEl esta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de cerdos para engordar, esta compra le ayudara a incrementar la granja y las ventas y a mejorar los ingresos econ\u00f3micos en su hogar.\nEl proposito de Juan es tener un negocio grande y darle el estudio a su hijo hasta sacar una carrera universitaria.\n\n","en":"Juan lives with his wife and son.

X., 52, can be found just outside the entrance of the school every  day selling fruits in bag, juices, empanadas and crackers to the school kids.. At the beginning of every day, she puts aside the coin from her first sale of the day to give to the church. She believes it brings her good luck to think of others in need. She also owns 4 little plots of lands and rents 10 more plots of land where she grows vegetables. A plot of land is known in this part of Guatemala as a cuerda and is about one sixth of a football field. She sells the vegetables she grows  in the large market in Quetzaltenango. Cornelia is an ambitious woman. With the next loan she hopes to buy 100 chicks and 3 bulls. She and her husband work hard because they want to be able to leave some land for a house to all of their 5 grown children. Unlike most women of her age in this community, Cornelia actually went to school and finished the third grade, so she can read and write. All of her children also spent at least a few years in school. Cornelia's village is nestled right against the side of the Santa Maria volcano, part of a complex of volcanoes that regularly rumbles tand that completely destroyed the village in the early 20th century. It's a place of beautiful green hillsides and lush plots of corn and vegetables, all divided into little sections called cuerdas. The poorer women often rent just one cuerda and try to grow their own corn for the family and sell some vegetables from it. Those who have more sometimes own two or more cuerdas, and sometimes rent even more. It's hard work, and they always refer to their life as a \"battle\" or \"struggle\", but they continue with the battle to feed their families and keep the kids in school.\r\nWritten by Nancy Lewis and

Several years ago, he noticed the need to establish a general store in his community, being that they were scarce; especially those that offer products that satisfy all the necessities of the residents. For this reason, he began his dedication toward his business. He tries as best as possible to offer variety in his products and good customer service, and when there are festivities in his town, he sells beer. He really enjoys this activity because it allows him to work as a farmer in the mornings while his wife works in the store. In the afternoons, he takes over so that his wife can look after their children. The most difficult thing is the transportation of his merchandise from the city to his community. Macario\u2019s reason for living are his four children, for whom he tries to become a better person.

Within it, vegetable production is what he likes most as it is easier to cultivate these plants and the product is profitable in season, which is annually. But the earnings are greater and beneficial for every farmer, especially when buyers purchase the production in great quantities and the expense of transporting the products is avoided as the buyers come to harvest and take them away themselves.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Una dificultad con su negocio es que algunos de sus clientes le piden fiado y se tardan bastante tiempo en pagarle y eso hace que en ocasiones no tenga dinero para invertirlo en la pulperia. Su meta es sacar a sus hijos adelante en sus estudios y tener un negocio mas grande. Desde que FAMA la apoya con prestamos siente que ha podido realizar muchas cosas para ella y su familia. Tienes varios ciclos en FAMA y ha sido una cliente puntual en sus pagos.  \n","en":"Sandra Lizeth is 32 years old and lives in Telica Abajo community, 40 minutes from the city of Juticalpa.  She is a single mother and has three children. Sandra has a small grocery store in her home which she works in on her own from Monday to Sunday, from 6.00am to 9.00pm.  Sandra started this business because she frequently had to travel to Juticalpa to buy food for her household in a grocery store there.  As she kept a good stock of products in her house, her neighbors always came round to borrow stuff.  After a while they would return what they had borrowed.  It occurred to Sandra that instead of lending products, she could sell them instead.\r\n\r\nSandra will use the loan that she has requested to buy general groceries (rice, coffee, sugar, beans, butter, pasta, herbs and spices etc.), so that her grocery store will be better stocked with a wider range or products.  One difficulty she has with her business is that some of her customers ask to buy on account and then take quite a long time to pay.  This means that sometimes she doesn't have the money she needs to invest in her store.\r\n\r\nSandra's goals are to get her children ahead in their studies and to have a bigger business.  Since FAMA have been supporting her with loans, she feels that she has been able to do many things for herself and her family.  She has been working with FAMA for several loan cycles and has been punctual in making her loan repayments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":820150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-07-22T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Lizeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4251.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221657984}],"funded_date":"2011-07-22T18:12:42Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:43:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":319094,"name":"Nilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nilda is 48 years old and has a fish selling business.

He worked for a boss who had the idea to work on foot and sell shoes in the local pueblos. After breaking off from this small business, Victor and his wife decided they would go into business together, and they followed a similar model from Victor\u2019s previous job. They had success early on because they knew exactly whichi towns were the most lucrative, and they offered promotions to the best buyers, whom they knew personally. Each day they work from 5am until 10pm. They have recently been so focused on sales that they have not had the time to replenish their inventory with new stock, so they sell goods in the morning and then use the proceeds from those sales to buy just enough shoes to still sell in the afternoon. Victor\u2019s wife is a great salesperson, and she typically goes to the small towns and local festivals which occur fairly often. They have two grown children who help sell their goods, and the family unit has maintained strong over the years. Their house is their greatest collateral. \r\n\r\nVictor needs this loan so that he can increase the volume of shoes and clothing  in stock to sell when the Riveras go to market.  He is a 48 year-old with four children, who of whom work for the family business. His wife is his right hand, and he could not do anything without her. She is responsible for the finances, taking care of the house, and looking after the children. They saved enough money to move out of Victor\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s house, which was putting pressure on everyone. Their new home was made of cane and they slept on the floor. Now, after working hard, they enjoy a house that is made of concrete, and each child has a room of his own. The Riveras are proud to have gotten out of their previouos situation, which was dire poverty. Although they are still poor, they enjoy a standard of living that most do not have in Ecuador. Their wish is to continue growing the business and open a store located next to their house. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":7693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Victor needs this loan so that he can increase the volume of shoes and clothing  in stock to sell when the Riveras go to market.

She and her husband make a net income of $5 per day to support their young child in school as well as Chim S.'s elderly mother. Chim S. has asked for a loan of $1200 to purchase a motorbike for her family's business.

In 2003, she decided to join ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with the hope that she would be able to access financial assistance for her business. She invested previous loans in the business of grilling pork, chicken, hot dogs and many other items. The business is in demand, especially during the afternoon when kids really long for grilled hot dogs, and for men who love eating grilled pork and chicken, especially while drinking beer. The business seems to be productive and profits sound. Now on her sixth loan, she seeks the amount of 25,000 pesos as additional capital for her primary business of grilling. Part of the loan will be used to pay for the sidecar of her tricycle as a secondary business.\r\n\r\nShe is optimistic that with the help of ASHI and Kiva, she can save money to build her own house and stop renting.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  videoke and a general store. Her husband Pedro, who is 40 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 11 children who are between 1 and 21 years old. Ma. Magadalena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Magadalena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,600 uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to use as additional capital for business and buy stocks for the store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Ma. Magadalena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Dora is a young woman who due to destiny\u2019s capriciousness separated from her husband remaining in sole custody of her son.  At the beginning this was very difficult but she gradually came out of that difficult situation and started farming with her parents growing cocoa beans, coffee and citrus fruit, products that currently are selling for good prices.\r\n\r\nIn the short period of time that Dora\u2019s been doing this work she\u2019s learned to value her efforts.  She knows that the work is hard and one needs constant strength and dedication.  She\u2019s happy with the work she does because thanks to it she earns profits.  In the future she\u2019d like to open a grocery store to earn better income than presently.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first MFP loan and she commits to make her installment payments punctually.  She will use the 2500 soles to hire day laborers to help her clear weeds from her coffee fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":905423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

However, with the help of this new loan, they will be able to further expand their individual businesses, make more sales, and continues to further improve their living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1549791,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy gallons of palm oil to add to her current stock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kenema","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Binta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Umaru ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Fatmata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Billo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Musu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":991960,"name":"Valen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valen is a married woman with two children.

She earns her living with her general store, farming, food vending and being a videoke operator.\r\n\r\nErlinda\u2019s husband, Tomasito, helps her run her businesses.  They have 10 children. Six of the children have their own families and the other four are still single and help their parents with household needs.\r\n\r\nErlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1994 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her general store, farming, food vending and being a videoke operator. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nErlinda is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 14,500 was used to fund operations of her general store, farming, food vending and being a videoke operator, which had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use on her general store and food vending.  Erlinda is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":503845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 WST) to improve and\/or expand the business.\n\nSaitia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Saitia's 4th loan with SPBD. \n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded South Pacific Business Development to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.  Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive updates on SPBD.\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale up to 3--the higher the number, the better off the person.  The metrics are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":722831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
