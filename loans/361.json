Now that she is the mother of five, she doesn't want her children to experience the life that she had. She is 43 years old and married to Lydio, a carpenter. She lives in Morong, Rizal province, in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nWith her innate desire to remove her family from poverty, in 2004 Arlene joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. She was very careful and wise in spending her loans and invested them in her resale business. Her business brings her income that can sustain the needs of her family, specially of her children.\r\n\r\nJust recently, Arlene requested a loan of 20,000 pesos as additional rolling capital for her resale business. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for fifty kilos of peanuts, rice, charcoal, bananas and vegetables, all for resale. She hopes that her business will grow and will bring her enough profit for her to achieve her dreams: to educate her children and also to build her own house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":361558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

He is a very hardworking and responsible father. He lives in his own home with his wife Estela, who is 46. She helps him with his crops. He also lives with his 3 children: Elizabeth, 23, Luis, 20, and Rosa, 17. What he wants more than anything is to have a calm old age and for this he needs to give his children an good education. \r\n\r\nFor Esteban, farming has been an activity he needs to live. Since he was very small, his parents taught him that if he worked in the fields he wouldn't lack for food. That is why he decided to continue with the family work and now he has his own crops. He has planted potatoes, peas, carrots, etc. Once these are harvested, he takes them to market in the city of Tarma.  \r\n\r\nWhat he likes the most about his work is planting, since he knows that his family's stability depends on this activity. He has been in farming for 50 years. What he considers the hardest is taking care of his crops in sudden weather changes, since this affects his productivity a lot. \r\n\r\nThis is the eight loan that Esteban has had with MFP and he knows that the loan will be beneficial to the development of his activity. In his communal bank, he is a very responsible member, and because of this he is very respected. \r\n\r\nWith the eight hundred nuevos soles he is asking for, he will purchase pea seed, fertilizer and insecticide to have a good harvest. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":495631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Puchase of seed and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T11:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esteban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":808.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886796}],"funded_date":"2010-02-25T14:01:59Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":184325,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more salon items in bulk.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-6 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2010-03-12T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":135134.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136741015},{"amount":100,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":135134.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144774129}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T04:05:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":188421,"name":"Juna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Juna N. lives in Dolchoki Village.

The group is comprised of 10 members and it is the first time that they have requested a loan from credicomun.  Mrs. \u00c1ngela Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Hern\u00e1ndez is a member of this group; she is 31 years old and studied until the 6th grade.  She is married and has two sons- ages 8 and 7.  She breeds and fattens sheep, which began 8 years ago with a single lamb, which fattened and sold.  With this money, she bought a lamb for the reproduction of the species and that\u2019s how their business began.  She is requesting the loan to buy food and fodder to feed their sheep. When she sells them, she will be able to acquire others and again invest in the growth of the lamb from the sheep.  Also, she has other animals such as chickens, turkeys, and rabbits.\r\n\r\nShe is excited about her loan application, because she has had other loans, which have benefited her greatly.  She has been able to invest in growing food for her animals and to consume in her home. She has also been able to invest in school supplies and clothing for her children. She is convinced that while business thrives she will continue working to provide greater opportunity for her childrens\u2019 education. She will also be able to improve their quality of life by bringing in goods for the home and services such as water and electricity since she does not currently have them.  Also, she hopes in time to increase the size of her rabbit-raising business because she believes that this business also generates good profits and maybe later can get larger orders, butchered or alive. Then, the business will grow generating the best income possible for her and her family. Areli C. D\u00edaz is the president of the group.  She is 22 years old and studied until her third year of high school.  She is a housewife with no children. She started fattening pigs a year ago and is requesting a loan to buy the food and fodder for these animals. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group include:\r\n-Paulina T. D.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  perfumes\/cosmetics sales and fish vending.  Her husband Roland, who is 46 years old, works as a government employee to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are 12 to 24 years old. Elisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to buy perfumes\/cosmetics to sell to continue to save up for future house renovations.  Elisa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

mayor\u00eda de su poblaci\u00f3n se encuentra agrupada en zonas urbano \u2013 marginales, es aleda\u00f1o a la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nSe dedica desde hace muchos a\u00f1os a la venta de comida en su

frecuentan el lugar. Este negocio le provee de ingresos necesarios para ayudar en el mantenimiento de su hogar, ya que los ingresos que percibe su esposo como trabajador de un peque\u00f1o hotel no bastan para salir adelante.\n\nHace dos a\u00f1os Patricia y su esposo adquirieron una mototaxi (veh\u00edculo motorizado utilizado en el transporte de carga y pasajeros) con unos ahorros que hab\u00edan estado reuniendo, con este veh\u00edculo se vienen generando algunos ingresos adicionales, el veh\u00edculo es manejado por un chofer particular y brinda servicios dentro del distrito de Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz y la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nEl continuo uso brindado a la unidad movil ha hecho que esta empiece a sufrir algunas fallas que requieren de urgente reparaci\u00f3n para que pueda funcionar correctamente. Por ello Patricia se encuentra solicitando a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 2000 nuevos soles que piensa utilizar en la reparaci\u00f3n y mantenimiento de su veh\u00edculo as\u00ed como en la renovaci\u00f3n de las licencias necesarias que permitan brindar su servicio dentro de la legalidad correspondiente.\n\nPatricia es una mujer emprendedora y una madre muy entregada a su familia.

It is considered the most populated district in the region and it also has one of the highest indices of poverty.  The majority of the population is in urban areas and is marginalized; she lives next to the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>Patricia has sold food in her home for many years, she has a menu and cebiche (typical dish made from fresh fish) sold to mechanics that work in the area and to the mototaxistas who frequent the place.  This business gives her the necessary income to help the household since the income that her husband receives as a worker in a small hotel is not enough to get ahead.\r\n<p>Two years ago, Patricia and her husband got a mototaxi (a motorized vehicle used to transport cargo and passengers) with some savings that they collected.  They have gotten some extra income from this vehicle.  It is driven by a hired driver and the mototaxi runs in the Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz district and in the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>The continual use of the vehicle has meant that it has had some problems and it is important to repair it so that it can work properly.  Patricia is asking for a loan of 2000 nuevos soles from Edpyme Alternativa (Kiva\u2019s field partner) that she will use to repair and maintain and to renew the necessary licenses to operate the mototaxi legally.\r\n<p>Patricia is a very enterprising woman and a very dedicated mother.  Her biggest with is to give her daughter a better quality of life.  She has worked with our institution before and has shown to be punctual and responsible when making her payments.  In the picture she is shown with her mototaxi and the driver in charge of driving it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Duque, Kiva

She buys goods from her suppliers every 45 days and has a good stock of merchandise.  However, her working capital is mainly tied up in her long-term portfolio and she needs to finance her business.  This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan, which will be the first loan that she has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy plastic tables and chairs, small electrical appliances, etc.\r\n\r\nAracely's liquidity ratio is high and she maintains a profitability margin which is in keeping with this type of business.  Her new injection of working capital will be successful because she has a good position in the market.  In addition, Aracely and her husband have the experience they need to achieve their goal.\r\n\r\nAracely's dream is to own her own home and, through her efforts, to ensure a prosperous future for her children by supporting them in their education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":791832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home

She learned her trade from her mother who is also in the same line of business.  Before learning her trade, Mar\u00eda was a student, but then decided to sell tamales.  She lives with her husband and children in a house owned by her mother.\r\n\r\nThe corn she uses for the tamales is delivered to her home but it is more expensive because of the delivery.

The loan he is currently requesting would be his second.  He intends to repay it in full and on time as he considers himself a responsible and honest young man, who fulfills the agreements he makes.

She needs a job to get more experience working. Soon she will take a leave of absence, but will remain on the pay-roll. Also, in the afternoon Shukufa helps her mother-in-law sell various goods in a small shop close to her home. They sell such food items as bread, sugar, pasta, etc. and other things including socks, hats, scarves, and all sorts of knick-knacks. Her mother-in-law goes to the town market for the food-stuffs, and has to go to a different town to get the non-edible things. Shukufa is taking out a loan for the first time, but she really wants to make a large profit before the New Year. If everything goes well, she will continue to take out loans in the future.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anya Ezhevskaya, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":244946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"for business expansion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2008-12-27T17:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shukufa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:06:34Z","rounded_local_amount":213.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10229622},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":213.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20427135},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":213.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27120643},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":213.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015761},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":213.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599498},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-30T07:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":213.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52993941}],"funded_date":"2008-12-27T17:49:57Z","paid_date":"2009-07-30T07:41:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":85179,"name":"Bashiran Sabir Ali Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bashiran baji is a 52 years old married lady and has resided in a city named Arifwala, Pakistan, for the past 12 years.

He is a hard-working man who earns income operating a motorbike taxi (called a piki piki by the locals) in Kisumu, Kenya.  However, he currently has to lease a motorcycle which costs a lot, leaving little profit.  Even if he does not get much business on a given day, Christopher has to pay the fee to the motorbike owner.  He therefore dreams of being able to save enough to afford his own motorbike, so that he can keep all the money he makes from his business.  Christopher already has decided on a particular model available at a downtown retail store, and will use his loan to make a down-payment.  \r\nChristopher is extremely excited about the work that

Food Vending , selling ready-made curtains and hollow blocks production. She lives in Prk Mabuhay, Brgy 3 Poblacion, Roxas, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her 3 business ventures, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 3000. Merly is now borrowing PHP 13000 so that she  could  purchase more ingredients for her food vending business.   This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Merly aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Z. is 53 years old and married. They have three children, aged between 19 years old and 4 years old, whom they hope to give good education to the university level. His business is located at Majengo estate in Mombasa, Kenya. Mombasa is the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many, many tourist attraction sites \u2013 not forgetting the Indian Ocean white beaches. \r\n\r\nHumphrey has been selling fish to the local people for the last 17 years and has managed to give employment to two people. He says that this business is profitable and his major challenges are financial constraints and the perishable nature of his products. However, he works hard from early morning to late evening to keep his business doing well.

She leaves home at 6am with one of her children who helps her sell and they return in the late afternoon to then go out again to sell clothes in the adjacent hamlets and to her girlfriends.  She goes house to house on foot carrying the merchandise to offer it since she does not have any means of transportation.\r\n\r\nShe asks Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan to buy more clothes in assorted styles and also to buy footwear to resell since many customers are asking for it and it produces good profits and her son can sell some of the merchandise.  In this way, she can offer more options to her customers having more styles and sizes available since her inventory is small and she sells out quickly.  Besides, she\u2019ll be able to reach more nearby settlements.  Mar\u00eda hopes to earn more income and repay the loan as well as provide food for her family.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s in the process of negotiating for a sales stand in the market to have a more stable place and not have to go on foot door to door to sell her merchandise; she also wants her children to have their own business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":890233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy assorted clothes and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"La Uni\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-10-10T17:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":72.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":73.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":75.54},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":77.46},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":80.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81.49},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.63},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75.59,"local_amount":75.59,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":75.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562708},{"amount":77.52,"local_amount":77.52,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":77.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250773834},{"amount":78.78,"local_amount":78.78,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":78.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182417},{"amount":81.48,"local_amount":81.48,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:56Z","rounded_local_amount":81.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317370},{"amount":83.56,"local_amount":83.56,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033055},{"amount":83.17,"local_amount":83.17,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645275},{"amount":88.63,"local_amount":88.63,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":88.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283491724},{"amount":88.95,"local_amount":88.95,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-17T08:05:21Z","rounded_local_amount":88.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287736278},{"amount":342.32,"local_amount":342.32,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":342.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294561568}],"funded_date":"2011-11-02T19:11:23Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":348292,"name":"Genesis Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Genesis es un grupo solidario muy independiente y responsable y se encuentra en su 1\u00b0 ciclo.

However, lack of sufficient capital is the biggest challenge that bars her from attaining the pinnacles she plans to reach.  \r\n\r\nAgnes is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. A typical cow, she is looking to buy, produces an average of 15 to 20 litres every  day. This amount of milk will greatly boost her sales volume. The money from the sales of the additional milk will enable her to pay her loan obligation without any trouble, and still manage to save some money for other uses. Your loan will help Agnes generate enough income to comfortably deal with farming expenses, which currently constitute the highest of her monthly expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1666305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4426.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4595.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4669.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4795.21},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5037.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5060.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5225.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5337.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5500.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5629.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5780.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5941.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.74},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.07},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.41},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Henry Goodman","image":null}},{"id":754571,"name":"Jesus'mide 1 Group","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe JESUS'MIDE 1 est compos\u00e9 de six personnes qui sont des amies.

is a forty-two-year-old married woman with four children, all of whom are in school. She rears kuku for sale. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. What are kuku, you may ask? Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular because they require little startup capital, require little space, and their eggs can be sold or eaten. Saida is assisted in her poultry business by one employee, her husband, and her children. Her monthly profit is approximately 120 USD. She is seeking a 275 USD loan to purchase additional chicks and feed that she hopes will help her breed more chickens for sale.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional chicks and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-17T21:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-01T01:51:05Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":32424,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344460},{"amount":54.5,"local_amount":59454.55,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":63111,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347912},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970486},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886703},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435964},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130267},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:05Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027098},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:36Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613138},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:39Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010221}],"funded_date":"2008-08-18T01:51:05Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":64701,"name":"Thi Thanh's Group","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n th\u1ecb Thanh Ms 09020033 n\u0103m nay 57 tu\u1ed5i, ch\u1ecb \u0111ang s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng b\u1ed1 m\u1eb9 ch\u1ed3ng, ch\u1ed3ng, 2 con. \u0110\u1ec3 nu\u00f4i d\u1ea1y c\u00e1c con \u0103n h\u1ecdc 2 v\u1ee3 ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb r\u1ea5t v\u1ea5t v\u1ea3 : l\u00e0m ru\u1ed9ng, nu\u00f4i l\u1ee3n, b\u00f2, g\u00e0, \u0111i ch\u1ee3 thu mua ph\u1ebf li\u1ec7u....

Begitu pula dengan Luh Juliasih yang kesehariannya sebagai ibu rumah tangga juga memelihara babi di rumahnya sudah sejak lama. Hal ini tentu saja untuk menambah penghasilan keluarga disamping tentunya membantu suami di ladang. Penghasilan suaminya yang tidak menentu mengharuskan Luh Juliasih lebih giat lagi beternak babi sehingga kebutuhan keluarga bisa terpenuhi. Setelah mengikuti sosialisasi dari staf DINARI akhirnya Luh Juliasih memutuskan meminjam ke DINARI untuk meningkatkan modal usaha ternak babinya. Pinjaman pertama ini berjumlah Rp.3.750.000,- dengan jangka waktu 6 bulan dan pembayaran kembali akan dilakukan pada akhir periode pinjaman setelah babi dipanen. Untuk mengawali, Luh Juliasih berencana membeli 2 ekor bibit babi penggemukan dengan harga Rp.350.000,- per ekornya. Sedangkan sisa pinjaman akan digunakan untuk cadangan biaya pakan selama enam bulan kedepan. Setelah 5 bulan nanti Luh Juliasih berharap mendapatkan keuntungan Rp.500.000,- dari penjualan babinya termasuk babi yang dibelinya dengan modal sendiri. Hasil dari beternak babi ini memang cukup lumayan bisa memenuhi kebutuhan keluarga dan sekolah anak-anaknya.","en":"Raising pigs are side job that is done by the majority of women in Perancak village. Same with Luh Juliasih who is regularly a housewife who also raised pigs around her house since a long time. This certainly helps the family income, besides helping her husband in the field.  Her husband's income is uncertain, and that forced Luh Juliasih to work harder raising pigs, so that family needs could be fulfilled. After attending socialisation from DINARI staff, finally Luh Juliasih decided to borrow from DINARI to increase the capital of her pig farming. First loan was for Rp.3,750,000,- (translator's note: 1US$ fluctuates between Rp 10,000-12,000) for a 6 months period, and payment would be done at period end, after the pigs were sold. To start, Luh Juliasih plans to buy 2  piglets to fatten at Rp.350.000,- per piglet. The rest of the loan would be used as feed expenses for the next six months. After 5 months Luh Juliasih hopes to profit Rp.500,000,- from pig sales, including pigs bought with own funds. Profit from pig farming is sufficient to meet family needs and children schooling.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Gwan Ang, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":259761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Pigs and it's feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2009-01-24T01:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Luh Juliasih","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3750000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":3750000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3971191.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52945108}],"funded_date":"2009-01-24T03:59:07Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:06:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gwan-Liong Ang","image":15626}},{"id":89291,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elena is managing a sari-sari store (a community based store) business in their village.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Canmoros, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She is 59 years old, married and has three children who are 32 to 37 years old. Because of her determination, hard work and dedication to help her children finish their college education, she finally achieved this aspiration. Now she dreams to continue improving their quality of life, her most immediate objective being to buy one more motorcycle as a business asset and to repair their house in the future.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, Teresita was not sure if she and her husband would be able to provide well for their family. This was because she knew that her husband's income was just not enough to cover all the expenses of their family, which included the school expenses of their three children. This is why in January of 1991, Teresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could borrow capital to start a business that could supplement her husband's earnings. She went through the necessary training seminar so that she could understand what was expected of her as an PD member. When she received her first loan, she started a general store adjacent to their family home. Because of its good location, it was able to earn a good income for her and her family.  At the next opportunity to start another business, Teresita went into rice retailing, sold dried fish and even charcoal to expand her product offerings and increase her income potential. She even bought a motorcycle as another source of income. Now she earns an average of 20,000 Philippine pesos per month, which is really a respectable income for a rural location.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, she borrowed Php 20,000, which she used as additional capital for her businesses. Having paid that, while maintaining her good credit standing, Teresita is now borrowing for her 17th cycle loan the same amount, Php 20,000, to be used as revolving capital for her business. Any income will used to buy the new motorcycle that she dreams to add to her ever-growing income sources.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":421029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He was born on July 30th of 1978 in Cochabamba.  He has a land parcel in San Luis on the riverbank. He plants potatoes and peppers and takes them personally to sell in Sucre. Spicy peppers is a very popular product in Sucre for food preparation. It is used in most of the traditional dishes, such as picante mixto, salte\u00f1as, mondongo and fritanga. He has been working with Emprender for three years and he is a good client. He makes his payments on time, because he is one of three brothers and they all help each other so as not to fall behind.

She lives in Purok Salmon within Barangay Zone VI, a part of Cadiz City within Negros Occidental province on the Visayas islands. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and frozen foods business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 5000 PHP. \r\n<p>\r\nBelenda is borrowing 16,000 PHP so that she can purchase more inventory to sell.

She is 55 years old, married and has 1 school-aged and 3 adult-aged children. Lydia is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Lydia V.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Lydia owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for ten years and earns approximately 20,000 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nIn 2006, she joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from PMPC. Lydia is requesting a new loan of14, 500 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products for her retail store. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Maria Dolly from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living condition of her family.\r\n\r\n About PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note:\r\nTo maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nAbout Group Loans\r\n\r\nIn a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee. Under this arrangement, each member of the group supports one another and is responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or default.

From a young age, she has been active, going to the market and looking for the best of everything in order to be able to provide good food to her loyal customers who always seek her out due to her good cooking and kind service. Afterwards she goes to the street with the clock tower where she has a stall and sells her delicious food. She has been doing this job for twenty years and receives assistance from her mother with whom she shares the responsibilities of the business. She likes to cook a lot; she grew up doing this next to her mom and she enjoy being together with her. Moreover, it gives her time in the afternoon to do other activities. Her customers are loyal and always seek her out because they receive good service and also because Flor's dishes are delicious. She's doing well and hopes her business is able to grow, having a more stable stall without going very far, and in this way be able to keep her customers. This will be her second loan with MFP.

She is married to Carlos, and lives with him and their three-year-old child in a home which they were able to buy after a great deal of hard work. Mitzy sells clothing and women's accessories; she has her own boutique which she opened two years ago in a special area of her home. This way, she does not have to pay rent. She provides very good customer service, and works alone. She enjoys her work because she is independent and can make her own money and support her husband with the household costs. She also has time to take care of her little one. Mitzy plans to open another location in a central area of the city, in order to expand her business more. This will be her fourth loan with MFP, and she is happy to have their support. She will invest all of this loan in the purchase of a large variety of clothing and accessories for the Christmas season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":914516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more clothing and accessories for Christmas.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Gabriel P., an electrician, and is the mother of three children, two of whom are already working and settled down with their own families while the youngest will graduate from high school at the end of the school year. By the grace of God, Eleuteria has managed to support her older children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to send her youngest to college. A dream for most Filipino parents like Eleuteria as she herself was once a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nEleuteria operates a canteen and a small variety store and oversees the operations of a gown-for-rent business. In the Philippines, the whole working community and majority of families only eat home-cooked meals during the evening when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal way of living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy greater quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nEleuteria dreams to be able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":625014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings.

She began her business a year ago. She learned in a course from the municipality that she took nearby. She began with a few things with her savings from selling tlacoyos (a Mexican snack). Every day she went out to sell her tlacoyos of fava beans, cheese curds, and kidney beans in the center of the community where she lives. Her business is important because she likes what she does and it generates income for her. She feels proud when she dyes hair, curls it, or does hairdos and the customer likes the result. Her clients are relatives, friends, and neighbors from the community. She is planning to expand her business and to buy all the supplies, furniture and materials necessary for her work, to give her customers better comfort and the services that they request. She thinks she will succeed by making an effort and saving, and with the loan she is going to stock up on all the materials.

She is an experienced farmer because she has been engaged in farming for 26 years.  She typically earns in the neighborhood of $4.00 per day through her effort.
