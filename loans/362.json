Therefore his wife Fatima has applied for a Kiva loan from field partner BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan amount she can financially assist her husband to buy the newspapers and magazines for reselling purposes, so that he can fulfill the demand of his customers and earn more profitable income.\r\n\r\nFor this financial support Fatima is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.

Her husband sometimes works for the construction employer to earn extra income and support the family better. Mrs. Tinh has always wanted to develop production in a sustainable way, so she has taken out loans at the Anh Chi Em Program to have enough capital to expand agricultural production. She also frequently receives training and counselling from the agricultural workers of the Program, so she is well aware of the necessity of having pigsty when raising pigs. For that reason, recently she has taken out a loan from Anh Chi Em to build pigsty. She hopes that with the pigsty, the pigs will grow fast and healthily then help her reap good profit and gradually improve income as well as living standard for her family.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mona joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Mona's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

is Rosario, 65, a resident of Binondo, Manila, Philippines. She is a mother of three children, all of whom are already in college, and married to Vinerando, a vendor. By the grace of God, Rosario has managed to support her children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Rosario as she herself has been an undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nRosario operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 35,000. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Rosario dreams to be able to give her children a high quality education through all of her hard work. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":818686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

O. is married with two children and an Acholi by tribe. He was born in Pader district and came to Kampala in October 2002 due to the rebel war which was terrible in that region of Northern Uganda and led to displacement of many people like him. When he came to Kampala, he had to settle in Acholi quarters where most of the displaced Acholi people live.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhile in Acholi quarters, he was working as a private security guard with the Hwan Sung company. That job came to an end when the company decided to recruit guards from a security organization. He had nothing to do until he joined the women in the Acholi quarters in making paper beads. That paved way for him to join Life in Africa in September 2006 when there was a position open for a security guard. He worked as a security guard in Life in Africa until February 2007 when he was given a position in a craft production team that earns him a better living.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSince he joined the organization, he has been so helpful to the organization and the other members. Through others members who have acquired this loan, he has seen how a small loan can change someone's life. That has inspired him to also try.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor his plan, he has discovered that building materials like stone are in a higher demand than ever before as there is massive construction and renovation of houses and roads in Kampala to meet the Commonwealth heads of government conference (CHOGM) due November 2007 in Uganda.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Acholi Quarter is located on a rocky hill, where stone can be easily sourced and laborers who know this work are available. When Jiponi gets this loan, he will begin by paying for the site right away, then hire people to dig out the stones. This may take him about a week. Then he will have the stones moved out of the pit, while those doing the crushing are also doing their part. In a week, the stones will be out, and about one and a quarter deliveries may be ready for sale, making a total of three deliveries per month. This work does not need much supervision, so all measurements and payments of laborers shall be done by him when he gets back home in the evenings.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo make this project successful, he is seeking loan in the amount of 250,000 Uganda shillings (UGX), and he will be able to repay in six months. (1 USD = 1,722 UGX). Jiponi hopes to make a profit of 150,000 UGX per month. Below is his estimated budget:\r\n<br><br>\r\nHiring a site..........20,000 UGX\r\n<br><br>\r\nExtraction labor.......20,000 UGX per delivery\r\n<br><br>\r\nPorters........... 7,000 UGX per delivery\r\n<br><br>\r\nCrushing labor ........ 32,000 UGX per delivery\r\n<br><br>\r\nSub-total = 79000 x 3 deliveries..... 237,000 UGX per month\r\n<br><br>\r\nContingencies ........ 13,000 UGX\r\n<br><br>\r\n    Total................250,000 UGX"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":21450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Quarrying","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Renting

Karina is a prisoner at the Santa Teresa Preventative Center for Rehabilitation in Guatemala City.  She says that she has committed errors in her life but is now working to change and improve her life and her future.  The Guatemalan government provides food and the most basic necessities for prisoners, but the food amount is small and of very bad quality.  Therefore, prisoners usually need a little of their own money to supplement what they receive from the prison.  As a result, many prisoners in the Santa Teresa women\u2019s prison have businesses within the jail, as is common in much of the developing world.  \r\n<p>\r\nKarina is very entrepreneurial and already has two businesses.  She works making arts and crafts to sell within the prison and is trying to set up a way to sell them outside as well.  Additionally she sells juices within the jail.  In the past she had access to another prisoner\u2019s freezer to cool the juice, but that prisoner left and took the freezer with her.  Obviously Karina can sell much more juice if it is cold, so she is requesting this loan to purchase a refrigerator.  She has already researched her options for refrigerators and has found a high quality used refrigerator and has also already gotten permission from the prison administration to bring it into the jail.  The refrigerator will cost 3,000 Guatemala Quetzals (approximately USD $400) and she will use the rest of her loan to buy more juice to sell.  She tries to maintain a stock of high quality juice and a good variety, such as pineapple, peach, and pear juice in addition to orange juice, apple juice, and Gatorade.  Karina also works to find the best prices for the juices and can currently buy many of the juices for 1.90 Quetzals each and sell them for 4 Quetzals each, a good return.  \r\n<p>\r\nKarina has many dreams of how to improve her life and what she can do when she is able to leave jail.  She has already studied to be a secretary, but she wants to continue studying to specialize in computers and would also like to study English.  She wants to start a business selling clothes and has already though a lot about various strategies that she could implement to develop and improve this business.  She would also like to have a kiosk to sell the arts and crafts that she already makes.  \r\n<p>\r\nFAPE has just gotten permission from the Guatemalan government to loan money to prisoners in Santa Teresa and is also working with the government to provide training for starting a business.  They also are hoping to offer more training to improve businesses in the future.  Although these clients are not typical microfinance clients, like all FAPE clients, they can only receive loans if they have a business or have the desire to start a business and a good plan to do it.  \r\n<p>\r\nKarina is extremely appreciative to have the opportunity to receive a loan to invest in her business.  When she leaves prison, she is going to face many challenges trying to reestablish her life.  She says that she is trying to start to save and plan now to be able to be successful when she is able to leave.  FAPE\u2019s training and her business that she is going to expand with the help of this loan are going to help her a lot to have more knowledge, experience, and maybe even a little money to help her get her new life started.  Furthermore, she will be able to take the refrigerator with her when she leaves jail.  Karina is very committed to reintegrating into society and never returning to prison.  Additionally, she says that she is very grateful to FAPE and to Kiva for giving her opportunities to rise above her mistakes and that these opportunities are like a light and a great blessing.  \r\n<p>\r\nTo learn a little more about Santa Teresa and FAPE\u2019s program there, you can go to this blog to read some observations from a Kiva Fellow: \r\n<A HREF=\"http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2008\/08\/11\/a-day-in-prison\/ \">A Day in Prison<\/A>\r\n<p><b>\r\nTranslated from Spanish by Megan Montgomery, Kiva Fellow.<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nKarina no es una clienta Kiva t\u00edpica, pero como casi todos los clientes Kiva tiene varios desaf\u00edos y est\u00e1 luchando de desarrollar un negocio y mejorar su vida.  Karina es una presa en el Centro Preventivo de Rehabilitaci\u00f3n Santa Teresa en la ciudad capital de Guatemala.  Ella dice que ha cometido errores en su vida, pero ahora est\u00e1 trabajando para cambiar y mejorar su vida y su futura.  El gobierno Guatemalteco provee comida y la necesidades m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicos para los presos, pero la comida es poco y de muy mala calidad.  Entonces, las presas suelen necesitar un poco de su propio dinero para complementar lo que reciben de la c\u00e1rcel.  Por lo tanto, muchas de las presas en la c\u00e1rcel de mujeres en Santa Teresa tienen negocios dentro de la c\u00e1rcel, como es com\u00fan en mucho del mundo en desarrollo.  \r\n<p>\r\nKarina es muy emprendedora y ya tiene dos negocios.  Trabaja en hacer manualidades que vende dentro de la c\u00e1rcel y esta tratando de arreglar una manera de venderlas afuera tambi\u00e9n.  Adem\u00e1s, tiene una venta de jugos dentro de la c\u00e1rcel.  En el pasado, ten\u00eda acceso a un congelador de otra presa para enfriarlos, pero ella se fue y llev\u00f3 su congelador con ella.  Obviamente Karina puede vender mucho m\u00e1s jugo si est\u00e1 frio, entonces est\u00e1 pidiendo este pr\u00e9stamo para comprar un refrigerador.  Ella ya ha investigado sus opciones para refrigeradores y ha encontrado un refrigerador usado pero de buena calidad y ya ha conseguido el permiso de la administraci\u00f3n de la c\u00e1rcel para traerlo en la c\u00e1rcel.  El refrigerador costar\u00e1 3.000 Quetzales Guatemaltecos (aproximadamente USD $400) y utilizar\u00e1 el resto de su pr\u00e9stamo para comprar m\u00e1s jugos para vender.  Ella trata de mantener una reserva de jugos de buena calidad y variedad, como de pi\u00f1a, melocot\u00f3n, y pera, adem\u00e1s de jugos de naranja, manzana y Gatorades.  Karina tambi\u00e9n trabaja para encontrar los mejores precios para los jugos, y ahora puede comprar muchos de los jugos por 1.90 Quetzales y los puede vender por 4 Quetzales, un rendimiento bueno.  \r\n<p>\r\nKarina tiene muchos sue\u00f1os de c\u00f3mo puede mejorar su vida y que puede hace cuando puede salir de la c\u00e1rcel.  Ella ya es secretaria, pero quiere estudiar la computaci\u00f3n para especializar y tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda estudiar el ingl\u00e9s.  Quiere iniciar un negocio de venta de ropa y ya ha pensado mucho en varias estrategias que se puede implementar para desarrollar y mejorar este negocio. Tambi\u00e9n quiere tener un quiosco para vender las manualidades como las que ya produce.  \r\n<p>\r\nFAPE acaba de conseguir el permiso del gobierno Guatemalteco para poder prestar dinero a las presas de Santa Teresa y tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 trabajando con el gobierno para ofrecer capacitaciones de c\u00f3mo iniciar un negocio, y tiene ganas de ofrecer m\u00e1s capacitaciones de c\u00f3mo mejorar un negocio en el futuro.  Aunque estos clientes no son clientes de microfinanzas t\u00edpicos, a la misma vez solamente se puede recibir pr\u00e9stamos si tiene un negocio o tiene ganas de empezar un negocio y un buen plan para hacerlo.  \r\n<p>\r\nKarina est\u00e1 extremadamente agradecida de tener la oportunidad de recibir cr\u00e9dito para invertir en su negocio.  Cuando sale de la c\u00e1rcel, va a tener muchas desaf\u00edos en tratando de restablecer su vida.  Dice que est\u00e1 tratando de empezar a ahorrar y planear ahora para poder tener \u00e9xito cuando puede salir.

They are both artisans\u2014her husband makes blankets and comforters with a large weaver and she is a specialist in small wall hangings, made with a small weaver.  Lucy does not need the help of any paintings or pictures to make the varied combinations of colors and designs on her wall hangings.  She says she has all of the designs in her mind and only needs to concentrate.  She has been making textiles for more than 20 years, and her abilities have earned her the recognition of her peers.  In the month of March her pieces are very profitable, but her greatest difficulty is that she lacks the money to produce large quantities.  For large orders, she only makes custom orders and requires one fourth of the cost up front.  The work of this artisan couple allows them to pay their household expenses and to provide an education for their children.  In earlier loan cycles, Lucy was the spokeswoman for her community bank, where she successfully completed her required duties.  This is her 3rd loan with MFP and she has always been responsible with her payments.  The money that she is asking for will be used to buy materials to make more wall hangings, since Easter is coming up and there is more demand for her work.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":292734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Weaving materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T22:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1319.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123948}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T23:48:12Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":101239,"name":"Bisoliha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"J.

His parents taught him how to get by as an agriculturist, and he learned very well. Now that he is the father of a family, he still works as an agriculturalist. Thanks to his parents, Bahrom now has the opportunity to move forward as a farmer, and he hopes to increase his agricultural produce so that he can bring his loved ones a more promising life. <P>\r\n\r\nDespite being a good agriculturalist and worker he needs help to move forward and improve his production. This is why he is asking for a loan, so that he can buy more of the seeds and fertilizers he needs, which are very expensive, but without them his production will not improve. You can help Bahrom keep moving forward with his development plans.    <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 51 years old and is a single mother of a 29-year-old daughter, who is working. Esther is from Huancayo and was a teacher, but when she came to Lima, she stopped working because she got married and was taking care of her daughter. When she and her husband separated, however, she started selling groceries and plastic products. She has had a stand in a fair for 25 years. Since she has been with Finca, Esther has learned to work and to be responsible with repayments. Esther needs a loan of 1600 soles to buy groceries, plates, disposable products, and bags.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 02.1.8 Nam Ng\u1ea1n.\n\nVinh is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Vinh makes and sells food.

Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vinh is requesting a loan from T. Hoa Fund for Poor Women for the first time. She is requesting a new loan of 3000000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. Vinh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\n\n1.

He is married and has the business of baking \u201clepeshka,\u201d the national bread. Hikoyatullo is the main breadwinner in the family. He believes that this business is profitable and is not subject to seasonality. He gets up early and bakes the lepeshka and bread so that people have fresh bread on their tables for breakfast. \r\n\r\nAll the input materials like the flour, salt and yeast, he purchases in the local market. Now due to high demand, Hikoyatullo wants to increase the number of breads he can make, so he requests 4700 Somoni. The loan will be spent on flour and on coal for baking the \u201clepeshka.\u201d\r\n\r\nHikoyatullo deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him. \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

His life is defined by his efforts.  He is motivated to succeed so that he can support his sister Ana who is studying culinary sciences in the capital.  Edwing dropped out of seminary so that he could support her.  He invests approximately 1000 PEN each month into growing spinach, carrots, and beans and brings his produce to the central market in town where he can sell them.  In addition, he travels to the capital twice a month to sell his goods to the wholesalers who offer very good prices, which helps him obtain a good income.  He enjoys monitoring, watering, and fumigating his crops because vegetables have greater demand than other products.

ventures:  general store and buying & selling charcoal businesses. She lives at 111, Brgy. Dancalan, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her general store and buying & selling charcoal businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,300. Virginia is now borrowing PHP 21,000 so that she could continue to purchase more stock to sell.  This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nVirginia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is married and is raising four daughters, the oldest out of whom is 11 years old.  Muratbek was born in a simple family of a shepherd.  He was the oldest out of his brothers and had two younger brothers, which is why he spent a majority of his time doing household work.  Upon finishing school, Muratbek was drafted into the army.  Having served two years, Muratbek attended a local college and learned the profession of a wide-scope tractor operator and mechanic.  After finishing college, he got a job as a tractor operator at his native collective farm.  Muratbek got married in 1995 and had his first son this same year.  At first, Muratbek and his young family lived with parents up until the collective farm allocated a plot of land to build a house and land to grow agricultural products.  Muratbek put all of his efforts toward developing his farming business and was able to use his profit from the harvest to buy livestock.  Over time, Muratbek invested profits from reselling grown livestock into building a small house with all of the storage sheds necessary for the business.  When the collective farm dissolved in 1998, Muratbek decided to lease farm equipment and offer land treatment services to the public.  Muratbek's family is slowly growing, with their needs growing as well.  To better meet their growing needs, Muratbek decided to obtain a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) and buy a heavy-duty truck in order to offer transportation services to the public.  Currently, thanks to his persistence and hard work, Muratbek has three dairy cows, five bulls and four heifers.  Muratbek plans to buy his own tractor and increase the quantity of livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":799904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a truck","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chaldovar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-06-24T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muratbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2225,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100710.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250535}],"funded_date":"2011-07-08T14:44:42Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:42:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":315156,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elena is a widow with 2 children.

Beatriz is a fighter who wants to succeed and go forward in life. One of her major goals is to build a concrete grill since now she has to cook with firewood, which is a bit difficult and uncomfortable. However, that has not stopped her from getting ahead. With hard work she continues to sell and expand to more locations.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":870167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to build a concrete grill","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Monterrey","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"25.666667 -100.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2011-09-18T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brenda Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Denisse Anabell","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"July Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":16517.43,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":918.3},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":932.45},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":946.81},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":961.39},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":976.16},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":991.21},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1006.45},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1021.96},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1037.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1053.65},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1069.89},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1086.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1103.05},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1120.04},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1137.28},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1154.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.27},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.39},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.52},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.21},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.43},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.93},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.21},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.81},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.15},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.51},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":295.85,"local_amount":3758.95,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3773.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232776633},{"amount":314.48,"local_amount":3995.78,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4011.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238581075},{"amount":689.67,"local_amount":8762.7,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":8797.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244539375}],"funded_date":"2011-09-19T00:11:15Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:39:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":339761,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cMUJERES UNIDAS\u201d; el banco se encuentra ubicado en el Distrito de San Jeronimo en la Provincia de Cusco y Departamento de Cusco.\nLa socia es la Sra.

He is married with two children.\r\n<p>\r\nAbdulaziz has a grocery store where he sells different kinds of foodstuffs. He began this enterprise eight years ago with a starting capital of $600, thanks to his perseverance and dedication. Over time he expanded his business and today this business has become domestic and his son (pictured) helps him with the business.\r\n<p>\r\nToday he needs to buy additional foodstuffs for increasing the range of his goods. For this purpose, Abdulaziz is requesting a loan of $1100 for the term of 12 months.

We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.   \r\n<p><br>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in large traditional extended families with their children, husbands, parents-in-law, sisters-in-law, etc. They have an average age of 35 and at least 5 children.  They grow mainly rice, and they grown peanuts as a secondary business.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about making their farms profitable, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program five years ago.  After having correctly repaid the first four loans, they are now on their fifth farm loan.  \r\n\r\nThe current loan will be used to buy a sufficient quantity of seeds for planting rice and peanuts, some minor supplies and equipment, and fertilizers and such, for farming.  Supplies are gotten at the marketplaces of Fonfona, M\u2019pessoba, and Zansoni.  Following the off-season, the crops are stored for a certain time, so that they gain in value.  Then the crops are sold retail and wholesale in cash transactions at the M\u2019pessoba market and at surrounding markets.  Their customers come generally from large cities.  \r\n\r\nAfter selling their produce, the group members each intend to realize a profit of 65,000 francs CFA that will be used to repay the loan and to cover common family expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":330632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and minor supplies and equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chata Sina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Doubati\u00e8  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Salif ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Dramane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata  Yacouba  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Madou    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami Yssouf ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou Daouda  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiara Drissa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Karim ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":550000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":550000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":550000,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":555661.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152144}],"funded_date":"2009-07-06T12:56:00Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":117639,"name":"Reina Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Reina Mar\u00eda S.

The distribution of farming inputs such as fertilizer and seed is part of One Acre Fund's integrated agriculture package, which also includes training, credit, and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith the income from maize sales, Moses will educate his children and invest in livestock rearing. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Luzanaka group will each plant maize plots between one half and one acre of land. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":917325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-23T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokolastica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Micheal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sophia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sophia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":85400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":85400,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":87685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680905}],"funded_date":"2011-12-27T05:30:42Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":364380,"name":"Bassem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bassem is a 51-year-old Lebanese man.

She learnt and got to know this trade while she was in the capital working for her older siblings' company which sells these sorts of things.  The support it has brought her husband and kids has been vital, and her kids have been able to go to university in their home town.  She started this business from a small room and served people from the window.  Little by little the business has grown and she now has lots of clients near where she lives.  She now has a very organized room with display cabinets, and she would like a freezer now too so that she can sell ice creams, lollies and cold drinks.  This means that she would be able to offer a better service to all her clients.  In order to do this she needs a loan of $325 which she will repay in 6 months.

At her bar she serves beer, sodas and spirits. Bars are much more than drinking establishments. They are places for people to gather and visit. Most villages will have one bar. Often the beer is made in-house. Beer is made with millet, sorghum or bananas, with yeast added to the first two versions but not to the bananas.

One could say that there is quite a lot of competition but the group members fight daily to get the income they need to support their homes.  This is why they need a loan, in order to acquire more goods at wholesale, in order to lower their prices and generate a better profit.

She lives in the development of La Playa, which is near the sea where many residents go to fish.  Daly Flor primarily sells cold cuts and sausages made of chicken and pork.  She also sells soft drinks.  This is her sixth loan and she wants to buy a large volume of processed meats and cases of soft drinks.  She experiences high turnover on the weekends, so she goes through her inventory very quickly.  Like many businesses near her, she needs to attract new customers to continue making sales.  Daly Flor started her business nine years ago when she began selling processed meats by taking orders.  Through her business, she got to know many people and began selling gold jewelry with them for a period of two years.  When the price of gold went up and no longer generated profitable returns, she returned to selling processed meats with greater enthusiasm.  From that moment, she joined a solidarity group with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and has managed to repay her loans promptly.  \r\n<p>\r\nDaly Flor is an esteemed woman who has succeeded in raising her children and running her business.  She has never lacked anything because she invested her loans in her business and generated good earnings to cover her expenses and support her family.\r\n<p>\r\nHer dream is to move to a different residence because she is affected by heavy rains during the wet season.  Another goal she has is to acquire a cooler so that she can store more processed meats and increase her inventory.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Looc, Ginatilan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: a bakery, a general store and a hog raising businesses. Her husband Danilo N., who is 59 years old, works as a baker to earn his living. They have 6 children who are between 18 to 35 years old. 4 of their children are married and 2 are currently going to school. Cynthia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cynthia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. A previous loan of PHP 11000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12000, which she intends to use to pay for more additional working capital for the business so that she could continue to save up for future to support the expenses of the family. Cynthia N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The couple provide for the household together. To meet her needs and provide for her children, Jacqueline has run a business selling escargot in her area for six years. Secondarily, she also prepares and sells 'akassa' (a local paste made from cornstarch) in her area. Jacqueline buys her products in Benin. This first loan will certainly allow her and the other members of the Nounagnon Adjadji Bata group to raise the level of their business and increase their clientele and income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":818803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy 8 sets of 40 snails and one bag of maize.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:57Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Genevi\u00e8ve","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"M\u00e8wanoussi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Hounm\u00e8 Sossi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"C\u00e9lestine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"L\u00e8dotind\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucienne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sidonie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"L\u00e9onie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeanne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Viviane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoire","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeanne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Henriette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":530000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75800},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75800},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75800},{"due_date":"2011-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75800},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":75800},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":75800},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":75200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.47},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.47},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.48},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.47},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.47},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.47},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":328.94,"local_amount":151600,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:17:49Z","rounded_local_amount":152422.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226977878},{"amount":164.48,"local_amount":75800,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":76211.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232737260},{"amount":164.47,"local_amount":75800,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":76211.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238541972},{"amount":164.47,"local_amount":75800,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":76211.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244501598},{"amount":164.47,"local_amount":75800,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-17T08:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":76211.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251061947},{"amount":163.17,"local_amount":75200,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-20T08:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":75607.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257112163}],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T20:07:33Z","paid_date":"2012-02-20T08:43:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":323385,"name":"Dionicia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cMARIA ELENA MOYANO\u201d; el banco se encuentra ubicado en el Distrito de Huanchac en la Provincia de Cusco y Departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

Y. is 55 and married.

There are 11 members in his family, and the costs are going to be increasing day by day. Besides these problems, his father has a serious illness and Y. must treat him because he doesn't have other brothers to take this responsibility. These hard problems definitely made a big headache for him, and he didn\u2019t know how to find solution for it. After thinking deeply, he decided to buy more livestock and increase his income through them. He hopes that this decision may give a positive result. He has applied for a loan of 50,000 Afghanis from AFSG for 24 months.\r\n<p>\r\nY. hopes to eradicate the barriers of the problems as soon as possible and then treat his sick father.

M. is from the town of Catarman, Camiguin Province.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Delia has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Delia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Delia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as additional working capital. Delia is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Delia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Juliet has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Juliet joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juliet has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients for her food products. Juliet is requesting a loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase more raw ingredients needed to make her food products. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Juliet from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

what Gloria S., 60, does to make the most out of her life. At 60, Gloria has already lost her life partner. She currently lives with her children and young grandchildren in Silang, Cavite. Gloria finds fellowship and entrepreneurial training in CCT*, where she is one of thousands of Community partners.\r\n\r\nGloria is a fruit and vegetable dealer. She primarily sells tropical fruits like mangoes and pineapples, as well as fresh vegetables for every-day meals. Gloria's commercial space is located in another municipality; while she lives in Silang, her store is located in Kawit (still in Cavite). Monthly she earns a net income of Php5,400. \r\n\r\nDue to previous financial struggles,  Gloria decided to request a loan of Php10,000 to help her grow her business. She will use this to purchase more fruit and vegetables to add to the array of goods in her store. Gloria will only pick the freshest produce to sell to her valued customers. Gloria says that this loan will impact greatly on her business capital.\r\n\r\nAt present, one struggle she has is the long lists of debts accrued by some of her customers. Gloria will make use of her 38 years of experience in the business to solve this issue. She aims to improve her business and include more products to sell. Above all, she hopes that her children will be successful and that her grandchildren will finish their education.
