She is 59 years old. Maxima is married and has 6 adult-aged children. To make a living, Maxima owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Maxima has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2005, Maxima joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maxima has successfully repaid a previous loan of 16,000 PHP from ASKI. Maxima is requesting a new loan of 17000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Maxima from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":465921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She has a long term partner, four children and lives in San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and sugar cane industries. The main economic activity here is the free trading zone, a cement factory, and other businesses. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n\r\nFor around seven years Alexandra has operated a colmado, a shop where you can find basic food staples. Colmados are within short walking distances from neighborhood homes. She started her business with a loan she receive from a friend. She plans to use this loan to buy rice, flour and other foods. She will use the profits to reinvest in her business, like her other eight loans. She wants to work. She says, \"now I have the strength to work harder. For my future, I want to have a better life, to live tranquil and safe.\r\n\r\nAlexandra says that her biggest goal is to have her own house. In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying to survive and to serve with her business. Her story is generally representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti.

She earns her living by selling garlic, onions and spices. Her husband Jerry, who is 54 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 7 and 13 years old, respectively. Rosalie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her children\u2019s education. D. C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today it remains a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged its already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About IMON International <\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

","en":"The \u201cVirgen de Cotoca\u201d Group, represented by Ms. Carolina, is comprised of 12 very dynamic members who wish to participate in activities together to fraternize and become more unified as a group. As they are neighbors, the women have had a friendship for a very long time. They all partake in various commercial and service activities, such as beauty salons, general stores, food sales, and cosmetics. One member has a general store, and when there are concerts in the area, he sells beverages at the venue. Ms. Carolina has her own beverage business, but would like to diversify her products. The majority of group members have stands in front of their homes, and the rest are street vendors. Despite all the adversities that they face, they know how to get ahead because their families depend on it. Concerning competition, we can say that it is high, but when it gets too tough, the group members simply move their stands away from the central market, thus boosting their sales. This loan will be used to restock their shops, purchase work materials and supplies in bulk, and the members who sell cosmetics will take advantage of the ongoing sales. Their greatest hope is to expand their stands to generate greater revenues so that they can offer their children a better future and quality of life. Despite the fact that this is their first loan cycle, the group members already have previous experience working in solidarity groups thanks to financial institutes similar to Fundaci\u00f3n Agocapital, to which they are very grateful for their trust and monetary support.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":423330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-11-19T08:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosio Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Skharlem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2160.94},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.8},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2210.95},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2236.4},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2262.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2288.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.49},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2341.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.28},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":319.93},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":323.61},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.34},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.1},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":309.13,"local_amount":2160.94,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2170.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788590},{"amount":312.7,"local_amount":2185.8,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2195.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788591},{"amount":316.28,"local_amount":2210.95,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2220.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678760},{"amount":319.93,"local_amount":2236.4,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2245.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678761},{"amount":320.49,"local_amount":2240.32,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2249.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073250},{"amount":661.31,"local_amount":4622.74,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4642.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073251},{"amount":0.25,"local_amount":1.72,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909138},{"amount":334.91,"local_amount":2341.13,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2351.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909139}],"funded_date":"2009-11-21T19:52:38Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":155142,"name":"Touch","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Touch S. lives in the Pour Ta Mouk village in Takeo province.

For many years this town has been famous for fishing. In previous times, this town was Rybachyi, which means Fishermen. Janyl J. is one of the citizens of this historical town. She is the elder daughter in her family, and that\u2019s why she has more responsibility for the things which happen around her. As the eldest one, she has leadership qualities. After graduating from school with the help of her parents, who gave her 20,000 KGS ($445), she opened up a little business by renting a pavilion which later on became a bigger one. Now the turnover is 150,000 KGS ($3,335) and there is no more renting because they have their own pavilion. Her business is selling carpets and rugs. She sells them in the new market of Balykchy town. She is married and has a child. Her husband helps her in her business and supports her as well in life. Their revenue is about 30,000 KGS ($665). The future plans are to open another pavilion where they would sell domestic appliances. Now they decided to take out a loan to buy a new gas cooker and new oven, as the previous ones are too old.\r\n\r\nAynur DJ. is a forty-nine-year-old, married woman whose husband takes across passengers. She has two children, both age  fifteen and attending the local school. About three years ago they started baking spice cakes and selling them in Bishkek. They began this business with 10,000 KGS ($225). They are planning to increase their experience by expanding their assortment. At the present time, they make two kinds of pastries, and the turnover is about 20,000 ($445). They want a loan to buy coloring agents, flour, sugar and cake boxes.\r\n\r\nChynar A. is forty-one years old and a married woman. She has three children. The elder son is a student and a daughter is a schoolgirl.  The youngest one is at home. Her husband works as an electrician in a company. She is planning to trade with fish and provide education for her children as well, but now she works in a confectionery. Her salary is 2,000 KGS ($45). She wants a loan to make her plan come true by investing money to grow.\r\n\r\nKaiyrkul K. is thirty-two and a married woman. She has a husband who works in the construction business and has a salary of from 2,000 to 3,000 KGS ($45 to $65).  She has three daughters who attend the local school. Like every parent, she wants to provide for education for her children in the future.  Now she works in a confectionery for 2,000 KGS ($45) per month, but it is not enough. That is why she wants a loan to trade with fish as well.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He is a humble farmer dedicated to producing such fruits as apricots, peaches, pears, etc.  He also produces feed for the animals inside his land.  This is why he has to leave early in the morning, and it takes time to go back home too. \r\n\r\nWhen he sees the harvest of his land, it comforts him and wants to harvest even more.  However, in order to do that he needs to invest large amounts of money.  He knows that with a larger harvest, he will have better results, and the fruit has to be of better quality in order to get more income from the sales.  \r\n\r\nAside from cultivating his land, Akbarali is also engaged in livestock.  Currently, he has 8 sheep.  He wants to increase his production and purchase more sheep to breed.  That\u2019s the reason that he applied to IMON International for a loan of 4000 Somoni ($1200 USD) for the term of 10 months. \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others.  \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She lives with the father of her three children in her own house.  Since she was very young she has been doing agricultural work like planting potatoes, peas, and beans.  Of all of her crops, beans are the easiest to gather.  Even though the potatoes and peas require much more physical effort, they are much more profitable.\r\n\r\nEvery day Mayela gets up very early to get breakfast ready.  By eight in the morning she has to be working the fields with her husband.  When it is time to water her crops, she does not sleep.  She starts at nine at night and waters until one or two in the morning.  This is the turn given to her by the water rights board in her community.\r\n\r\nThis is how she works her crops, and she does so with much affection.  She knows that thanks to them, she receives the income to support her family and educate her children.\r\n\r\nBy doing well in the next and future harvests, Mayela hopes to be able to acquire irrigated land.\r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan with MFP.  During the previous seven loan cycles she has shown that she makes her payments on time.  She tries to attend all of her community bank\u2019s meetings, where she feels very comfortable being with her colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe money she is asking for is to buy chemical fertilizers and a bag of better quality pea seeds. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":353006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy seeds and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-16T15:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1057,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734054}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T18:03:56Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":126299,"name":"Srey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Srey M. is a farmer in Chroy Slaeng village in Takeo province.

It is located in the Cuautlapan community, in the municipality of Ixtaczoquitlan in the state of VeraC., Mexico. The group is maD. up of 13 members. Alejandra O. M. is the president of the group - she sells snacks (peanuts, seeds, pork scratchings) and she has asked for 3,000 pesos with which to buy ingredients to prepare her snacks. Also in the group is Mrs. Rosa Maria C. F. who is 34 years old and only went to primary school. She makes and sells tamales, which she sells in the streets from a cart. On Wednesdays she sells them together with her husband who works in the same business. They have been selling tamales for 21 years and she is asking for a loan in order to buy plantain leaves in which to wrap the tamales. She is married and has 4 children of 19, 17, 15 and 12 years of age. She began selling tamales from her house but after the birth of her children she needed to go out with her husband into the street to sell them and increase their sales. This business is the family's only source of income; thanks to the business they have been able to build a house on land they inherited and educate their children, all of whom are currently studying and also helping to sell tamales. As well as buying a small second-hand van to use to transport the tricycle from which they sell their tamales to other communities and increase their sales, she dreams of one day buying some land and having rooms for rent and securing a future for when she can no longer work, and perhaps buying a new car. All of this will help to grow her business thanks to loans. <p> The other members of this group and their occupations are: <p> Elizabeth H. F., selling clothes; <p>  Guadalupe Fidelia R.

It is a municipality in the department of Bolivar. She is married and she has 3 children. They are the force behind her efforts and they are 4 and 17 years old. She started out her business six years ago from her own home, selling prepared foods in her home, catering parties in a buffet style, and baking pastries. And as her business increased she moved it to a commercial store space. It is located in the main town square where she has earned a wider recognition through better exhibition and preparation of her products. Her sales have increased and her products sell out quickly. Her working capital is not sufficient to make purchases in larger volumes and to obtain the discounts that would increase her yield. This is the reason why she requests a Kiva loan. It is the first loan she accesses through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). With her loan she will purchase ingredients needed to make her products and to purchase juices, cold drinks, liquors, and spirits. Her dream is to have a business in a more central location in her town and installing a type of palm hut to attract the attention of her clients. While sets herself loose to pursue her dream and as she works to attain it, she observes a sales profit of no less than 27% and a profit margin of 20.28% on her investments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":838846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase ingredients needed to make her products and to purchase juices, cold drinks, liquors, and spirits.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Patrick also participates in  women groups activities advising on safe water usage and general hygiene. Patrick aspires to be a nurse in near future.\n\nThe greatest challenge in performing his duties as a Community Health Worker has been low incentives and transportation, as he has to cover many household spread between far locations, the terrain can also be difficult especially during the rainy season. Having a motorcycle will enhance is work, increase the coverage and thus the number of household visited in a given period. The motorcycle will be a working tool to enhance easy and faster access to health services to the community. While not being used for community outreach activities the motorcycle will be engaged in micro-business errands such as community taxi, community courier service, milk delivery service etc bringing the needed extra incomes to the families. This is a big incentive to the CHWs who are mostly young at the beginning of their careers in the Health sector. \n\nMotorcycle micro business in Kenya is a thriving sector with very good returns, the motorcycle costs about USD1300,however,riders are bale to make net returns of about USD15 per day, while the loan repayment is about USD4 per day, payable in 18 months. BodAfya is a new loan product which has proved very popular with CHWs. The product is well linked with the existing CHWs public systems and networks in Kenya. It has positive benefits of supporting the community health programmes, and at the same time supporting families improve their livelihoods and incomes, resulting to a healthier and wealthier community."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1266339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To buy a Motorcycle for Community Health Work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Meru","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.05 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":272,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":6111.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6111.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.23},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":528992,"name":"Alas De Cofradia Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo est\u00e1 formado por tres socios emprendedores de \u00e9xito una de ella es Esther tiene 21 a\u00f1os de edad, casada y se dedica a vender cosm\u00e9ticos y ropas variada desde hace 5 a\u00f1os, el cr\u00e9dito lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de cosm\u00e9ticos de la Avon como cremas para cuerpos, crema para manos, crema facial, perfumen de dama, perfume de var\u00f3n etc. \n\nLos otro dos del grupo: Dora tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad y vende ropa nueva y variada y F\u00e9lix vende leche de vaca ambulante con carret\u00f3n de caballos.","en":"This group is composed of three successful entrepreneurs.

Z. is 27 years old, has a college education and is an economist by training.  He is married and has 2 children.  Ahliddin owns a car which he uses to offer taxi services to residents of Qurgan-Tube.  Ahliddin will use his loan to purchase equipment that will allow him to use gas instead of gasoline in his car.  This will allow him to control his costs and to not raise his fares.  Local residents will be able to take advantage of Ahliddin\u2019s lower priced fares, as many cannot afford the fare increases resulting from increasing gasoline prices.

She used her first ACCION USA loan to buy a second sewing machine, and she plans to use this one to buy more materials so she can prepare for an uptick in business with the coming holiday season.

She lives in Brooke's Point, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Elizabeth is now borrowing PHP 14,000 to purchase more items for resale. This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Elizabeth aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

R. is a very creative woman. She operates a business selling craft products made from wood, textiles, linens, etc. She is married and the mother of 4 children who are between 4 and 10 years old.  She began by offering classes in woodworking and painting and, later, embroidery and decoration, as well.  She started a business making products from her designs 2 years.  The business is now a success.  Her students make craft products using her tools and supplies and she then sells the products on at an attractive price.  Sandra is applying for a loan from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo because she needs to buy basic supplies, especially wood, and improve the entrance to her shop.\r\n\r\nSandra hopes her business will continue to grow and ultimately become a large store selling traditional craft products, but also a place where people can come to learn to make traditional crafts.  She would like to expand to other cities in Colombia, as well, so that she can increase her income and provide her family with opportunities that they wouldn't otherwise have.  The challenges that she faces are most apparent during the low season when her sales fall and she has to apply all of her genius to press sales of her products.\r\n\r\nSandra Patricia lives in a neighborhood with a good mix of businesses that support her type of business.  It's very commercial and, at the same time, residential, quiet and safe, but also close to large stores and supermarkets.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

C. is a 51-year old married woman who supports her family by operating 2 business ventures: hog raising and general store businesses.  She lives in Prk. Bloomington, Brgy. Candau-ay, Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her hog raising and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now eans an average income of PHP 8,000. Lily is now borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she can continue to purchase feeds for her piggery and stocks for the general store.   This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lily aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

By working hard in her food vending and frozen foods businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Shernalyn is borrowing PHP 19,000 to fund operations. This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Shernalyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Pada bulan Juni sampai September,  tanaman Vanili ini  mulai berbunga dan saat itu pula I Made Mekir mulai sibuk untuk mengawinkan bunga Vanilinya agar bisa menghasilkan buah,  karena tanpa bantuan manusia tanaman ini tidak dapat berproduksi . Pada masa ini pula I Made Mekir banyak membutuhkan modal untuk membayar tenaga kerja yang  membantu proses perkawinan itu  karena proses ini harus dilakukan dalam satu hari saja dan bunga akan gugur bila terlambat dalam mengawinkan Belakangan ini harga pupuk dan anti hama mengalami peningkatan sehingga dampaknya sangat dirasakan oleh petani.

These plants are highly sought after because they are very useful in curing certain ailments, fevers, and upset stomachs. For the past year, he has been producing these herbs along with cultivating other agricultural products grown on his farm. This work is based on the love he feels for his parents, and he wants to help them pay the educational expenses of his brothers.

Specifically, such loans allow borrowers to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Even so, most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term, and nearly all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

The loan will greatly improve Rustamjon\u2019s income and his family's living standards.  \r\n<p><br>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":303896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

She is married and has 1 school-aged child.  To make a living, Karoline owns and operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general services to local community members.  Karoline has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 350 Tala WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Karoline joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Karoline is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Karoline is now requesting a new loan of 1000 Tala WST which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide services. Karoline plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her greatest monthly expenses include paying utility bills, school fees for her children, medication and feeding the family. Susan owns a small eating joint in Kitawuluzi selling all types of traditional food. She buys foodstuffs from Owino market, one of the city markets, and so she incurs transport costs to and from shopping. She receives an average of 10 customers a day. She has done this business for over 10 years. Her main challenges are defaulters and the rainy season because she works from a muddy place. She works on a retail basis only. She has been with MCDT for over seven years, servicing her 16th loan working all along with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more bunches of bananas and cassava. She hopes to see her business grow bigger and own a big hotel.
