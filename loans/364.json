Reyna works in a free trade area, where she earns a small salary. Nevertheless, her husband helps cover household costs.  Because of the family's small earnings, they haven't been able to improve their home.  For this reason, they find themselves needing a loan.

H. (far right in pink) is the group coordinator for the Bank of Hope Mujeres Liberadas (Freed Women). She lives in Los Alcarrizos, which is a city about one hour northeast of the capital, Santo Domingo. For the past three years, Andrea has sold various items such as clothing and underwear. With her first microfinance loan she intends to buy 20 bed sheets, 20 collared shirts, and 12 pairs of high heels, which she predicts will bring in a profit that will approximately match the loan she\u2019s receiving. One of the benefits of microfinance is that the initial investment is replicated, because loan recipients such as Andrea reinvest their profits in their business. One point that Esperanza International emphasizes is that profits need to be used to better the family or the business, and Andrea certainly understands this fact. \r\n\r\nOne of Andrea\u2019s personal goals is to improve her life each and every day. With profits from her business, Andrea intends to start saving and invest in her children\u2019s education. She has three children (13, 10, 9) and is pregnant with her fourth child who is due in December. While Andrea has not finished high school, she hopes to return to school and continue her education. Above everything else, Andrea looks forward to a better future.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of Andrea, the Bank of Hope Mujeres Liberadas, and the microfinance institute Esperanza International (one of Kiva's field partners), thank you for providing opportunities for those who need them most.

She is 42 years old, married, and has four school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a specialized retail store, selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, Silver Swan products, candies and powdered soap in the local community. Liza has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately $233 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Liza joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.\r\n\r\nLiza is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 2nd loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

He is from Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  From childhood he has been interested in agriculture, and today he is engaged in animal husbandry. He sells cattle in the market located in Vahdat city.  Every week he purchases cattle for 1500 to 1700 Somoni and sells them for 1800 to 2000 Somoni. He has been in this business for 3 years. Besides that, he also sells vegetables and milk.  Anvarshoh would like to get a loan of 7000 Somoni to expand his business.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":220715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:01:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lulu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970728},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886945},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436205},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130478},{"amount":27.77,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027280},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613303},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010386},{"amount":27.79,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232697},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664513}],"funded_date":"2008-11-09T12:11:10Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":76823,"name":"Sokha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sokha K. lives in Thorm Ney village in Takeo Province.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general alteration and tailoring services to local community members.  Th\u1ea3o has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately $175 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Th\u1ea3o joined TYM Fund, a Kiva field partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  Th\u1ea3o has successfully repaid a previous loan from TYM Fund.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional fabrics and materials.  Th\u1ea3o is now requesting a new loan of $575, which again will be used to buy fabric and other sewing materials.  This will be the fifth loan taken out by the borrower from TYM Fund.

She is 26 years old. Janice is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Janice works in a family member's business venture in a specialized retail business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling \"GTY\" products or Ready to Wear clothing items in the local community. Janice is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Janice joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Janice is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Janice from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She constantly suffered beatings by her husband to the point where she had to go to the hospital.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is when she decided to start selling clothes.

She started her business using the loan she received from ASHI when she became a member in the year 2002. This was just small then but because of so many trials due to poverty, Lorina strived hard to make it grow and expand. Her vision of giving her three children a better future using the proceeds of her business enhanced her eagerness to explore the potentials of her business. Her husband has been so supportive to all her ventures. Looking back at Lorina\u2019s business, now it has a lot of accomplishments. Before, her franchised fried chicken rolling store operated only in one municipality and was transported by bicycle. Now it operates in four neighboring municipalities and is transported by motorcycle. Lorina feels happy with her business achievement. However, it is not yet stable enough for her to feel financially secure. Without her a loan, her business can never grow, especially when time comes when her three children (whose ages are from eight to 13 years) are ready to go to college. Therefore, Lorina is requesting another loan in a larger amount to put up another business, which is a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) for transportation. She hopes that by having several businesses, she will have more income, have more savings for the future of her children, and will be able to help her other relatives by employing them to work with her in her businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":522874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Carmelita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Carmelita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carmelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Carmelita is now requesting her second loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

He sells his products in Ventanas and Puerto Pechicho, every six months for the corn and rice, but only small quantities of cacao.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting this loan in order to work the summer season; to buy seed and fertilizer.  He feels that this loan will be helpful because the interest rate is low and he will earn a good income.  His dream is to leave something behind for his children and to be able to work more.\r\n\r\nHe likes to cook and rest in his spare time.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":572648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Seed and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Ventanas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":159,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Clemente ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191403013}],"funded_date":"2010-08-15T21:14:07Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:38:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She is an architecture student, which adds value to her business by using its natural aesthetics to attract customers who otherwise wouldn't notice it. Her mother and siblings have always supported her entrepreneurial ideas. A long time ago she started out selling meat, but since that business only operated during the morning she decided to start selling merchandise out of the side of her home. She took out her first loan with Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo six years ago, and since then she has received a total of eight loan with which she has been able to stock her store with supplies. She has invested the profits into making improvements on her home. She bought household appliances to make her domestic life easier. Now her dreams are to expand her business and build an apartment on the side of her store and put it up for rent, and in this way generate a new source of income for her family. With her loan she plans to purchase clothing, stationery supplies and household items and investment that projects a gross profit of 40 percent with a high probability of success. In her experience, December, January and February are the months where she makes the most sales. Lorena is pleased that her business is located in a business corridor on the main avenue because she permanently has a view of many of her customers and passersby, which means she is always thinking of ways to invest new working capital and finding financial leverage with loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo

Over time, she hopes that her business will grow and that she will be able to make more income.\r\n\r\nThis is Abina's seventh loan from MFP.

He is married and lives with his wife Mary, his parents, a 7-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old son. \r\n\r\nAll the adult members of the family are involved in agriculture. In particular, they have a dairy farm with four milk cows. Mary and her mother-in-law produce approximately 70 kg of traditional Georgian cheese per month with the milk and sell it at the local market. The family also owns 2.5 hectares of agricultural land, 1 hectare of which is used for growing watermelon. They harvest 20 tones of fruit which is sold to the wholesalers. Another 1 hectare is used for maize:  3 tones are harvested each year, 1.5 tones of which is sold locally and the remaining 1.5 tones is used in the dairy farm for feeding cows and calves. On the remaining 0.5 hectares, various vegetables are grown, which are sold at the local market. \r\n\r\nMalkhaz requested a loan for cultivation of the land and purchasing watermelon seeds.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Onisa has made her living in Barranquilla for the last three years packing and selling bean sprouts, which she distributes to granaries, restaurants and supermarkets.  Her business started out very small.  After her husband became unemployed, the need to generate some income drove them to take advantage of the experience Onisa had acquired from an old job and to develop an entrepreneurial plan.  Her business has expanded, and today they pack and sell packages of bean sprouts though a third party and even have a bar-code to get directly to the big retail stores.  Their need to grow brought them to apply for a kiva loan, their first financing, which they are doing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

mucha atenci\u00f3n, s\u00f3lo se debe saber seleccionar a los animales y ubicarlos adecuadamente en sus jaulas, por lo general le toma parte de la ma\u00f1ana para  limpiar, alimentar y seleccionar a sus cuyes. Lo dif\u00edcil es mejorar la raza, para ello tendr\u00eda que adquirir animales de raza y poder alimentarlos adecuadamente. Adri\u00e1n tiene en sus hijos los mejores motores que le ayudan a seguir mejorando como padre y agricultor. \r\nEste padre anhela que su peque\u00f1o criadero de cuyes mejore y sea el m\u00e1s reconocido para cumplir los diversos pedidos de cuy para exportaci\u00f3n. Para ello, requiere comprar animales de raza para mejorar la calidad de sus cuyes, por lo que solicita este pr\u00e9stamo.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish Eliza Wethey, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nAdrian is 47 years old and lives with his wife and their 5 sons who are 20,16,14,12 and 10 years old. He is a man who from an early age was characterized as a hard-worker who was very dedicated to his agricultural lands, and now works raising guinea pigs; he saw this as an activity that would enable him to have additional income due to the high demand for these animals in the markets.  This type of work does not require a lot of attention, instead, you only need to know how to select animals and place them properly in their cages. It usually takes part of the morning to clean, feed and select the guinea pigs. The challenge is to improve the breed, but in order to do so he would have to acquire pure-bred animals and feed them properly. Adrian has the best intentions for his children, this allows him to continue improving as a father and farmer. This farmer yearns to improve his bread of guinea pigs so that he will be better known in order to take advantage of the various orders for export. In order to do so he is asking for a loan, this will allow him to buy animals of a better breed in order to improve their quality."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":190792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of pure-bred animals to improve the quality of his guinea pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-08-17T03:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adri\u00e1n","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-31T05:21:16Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":85.71,"processed_date":"2008-09-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-01T07:25:56Z","rounded_local_amount":87.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":342796},{"amount":29,"local_amount":82.86,"processed_date":"2008-10-31T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":84.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":375048},{"amount":28.5,"local_amount":81.42,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:26:46Z","rounded_local_amount":83.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335711},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":85.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9956889},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":85.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227141},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":83.35,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:09:24Z","rounded_local_amount":85.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422383}],"funded_date":"2008-08-17T05:21:16Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T20:09:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":64537,"name":"Amina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amina  is 25 years old.

Later, thanks to his sacrifice and sense of purpose, he was able to pull together enough money to start his own tannery business but he has to lease land from someone else to operate it.  Dario says that his dream is to buy property of his own and set up a proper operation with all of his tools and equipment where he can work with his son.

His wife looks after the animals and Muzaffar takes them to the market when they are grown enough and sells them. This brings a very good income into their family budget.

She confessed borrowing money from their buyer and used it as starting capital. She endured the high interest rate attached with that loan because she had no other option.  But when she heard about the Community Economic Ventures Inc.

the province of Negros Oriental. She earns her living by vending fish and operating a general store business.\r\n\r\nCarol\u2019s husband Edmund is 55 years old and a fisherman.  They have three children, two who help their father in his fishing business.  Both Carol and her husband dream to improve their living conditions and to sustain the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nCarol R. joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 5,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nCarol R. is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 5,000 was used to fund operations of her fish vending, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 12th loan, the amount of Php 10,000, which she intends to use to buy supplies for her fish vending and general store. Carol is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

","en":"Born in 1973 in Attotinga in Benin, Viviane Y. is married to Andr\u00e9 AMOUSSOU, a tailor, and is the mother of seven children, all having attended (or are still attending) school. Two of the children are no longer under their parents\u2019 care. For the past 15 years, the family has lived in the Dogoudo borough of Allada, in the Department of the Atlantic. The couple jointly shares family expenses.\r\n\r\nViviane has not attended school. To meet her needs and help her husband financially, she sells kitchen salt and various other products in Allada (canned tomatoes and sardines, pasta, soap, sauce condiments, etc.). She gets her supplies from Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin, and sometimes in Allada.\r\n\r\nViviane has been in this line of business for ten years and has already been granted three loans from ALID\u00e9, all of which were repaid in full. Facing an increasingly important customer demand, she is no longer able to satisfy all customers, and is therefore requesting a fourth loan. This loan will be used to bolster her activity to increase customer satisfaction.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees.

She earns her living by operating a tricycle transport business. Her husband Victor, who is 30 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 4 and 9 years old. Helen Grace joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helen Grace has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,200, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000 to buy an additional unit of motorcycle so that she can earn higher profits. Helen Grace is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mary plans to buy cassava and potatoes for farming, manure to fertilize her fields, corn and pineapple. Mary also intends to purchase piglets and chickens. These animals can be useful as an investment and also as fertilizer for one\u2019s farm. Lastly, Mary will buy some small garage tools. \r\n<p>\r\nMary has been a farmer for many years and has experience using loans to fund her farm business. This is Mary\u2019s fourth loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2005. She knows from her past experience that she can take on a loan of this size and be successful. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore she joined GHAPE, her life was very difficult. Her father passed when she was only 13, ending her education. She says she was forced to marry early and since then has lost her husband to a protracted illness leaving her to support her eight children. Mary was \u201cfinancially not okay,\u201d as she could not cover basic needs. \r\n<p>\r\nMary is a GHAPE member because \u201cGHAPE\u2026empowers the poor\u201d and \u201chas trained me and equipped me with prosperous knowledge.\u201d After being with GHAPE for three years, she has \u201cdiscovered the benefits of being a GHAPE member.\u201d\r\n<p>\r\nWith the profits from this loan she will pay for her children\u2019s school fees, provide the best for her children and finish the housing projects her husband left behind. She also wants to save a reasonable percentage in her GHAPE savings account. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nGrounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and a strong bond of trust has developed between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":331014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"For cassava, potatoes, manure, corn, pineapples, pigs, chickens and garage tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Mile 90, Bamenda, N.W.

She is 44 years old, married, and has six school-aged children. To make a living, Pablita owns and operates a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing transport services to local community members. Pablita has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Pablita joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase materials needed to expand the services she provides. Pablita is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This loan will be her third from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her children's education. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Together they work with great determination so their only son, Miguel, will lack nothing. \r\n\r\nFor more than 20 years she has worked to provide a good quality of life to her only son. To that end she sells ice cream during the day and sweets in the evenings from a small sales location and while walking around. Her partner works as a motorcycle taxi driver, using a vehicle he bought through a lot of effort. With the income they both earn they are able to cover the household expenses and the education of their son. At the same time they are saving for the future so they can use the money in a project such as building their own house or to buy another moto-vehicle that would help them earn greater income. \r\n\r\nWhat Carmen likes the most is attending to her clients in a careful manner. However, it bothers her to have to work until the late hours of the night, which is tiring, even though it is worth the effort since the business is profitable and allows them to live  without economic worries. This is her sixth loan with MFP and she is very happy working with her communal group where she receives educational talks that help her carefully use the loans she receives. \r\n\r\nWith this request for 3000 soles she will buy another moto-vehicle and rent it daily, which will assure them of  benefiting economically.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva

She only received 45 minutes worth of instruction at a time though as her neighbor's husband got annoyed if he found her in his house.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of the bad treatment which she received in learning her traD., after a couple of weeks she had learned all she needed to in order to set up her business and now she no longer has just 3 meters of fabric and 10 rods but rolls of fabric and more than 100 kg of rods.

She lives in her own home in Pomalco district, in the rural part of Chiclayo, the capital of Lambayeque region.\r\n\r\nFor three years, Raquel has been raising and selling animals.  She carries out this business activity on a plot of land near her home.  She raises the animals until they reach a good size and weight, then she sells them in the local market.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mobile phones have inundated the market, and this compelled her to close up her business and start off in poultry farming, which proved to be very profitable. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately her only daughter, who just brilliantly clinched her high school diploma, has died having drowned in an Olympic swimming pool. Traumatized, she is no longer able to take care of things; worse, she fractured her ankle. Misfortune never travels alone; her son will have his leg amputated due to a chronic tumor.

Concepcion has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Concepcion joined ASKI to gain access to their financial services. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI which she used to buy additional products to sell, this will be the fourth loan taken out by Concepcion from ASKI.

It has 25 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and -women, and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The communal bank is in its second loan cycle, and is made up of 10 individuals.  The bank was founded by a group of women on November 17, 2009.\r\n\r\nThe communal bank\u2019s president is Yina, the treasurer is Yorgina, and the secretary is M\u00f3nica.  Most of the women in the group make a living selling cosmetics, clothing, food, or groceries; working as seamstresses; providing transportation; or in other activities.  The group meets at 2:00 PM on Tuesdays at Yina\u2019s house.  The new members who have joined are happy to work with Emprender, since they learned during the Reto\u00f1o 2009 Communal Bank\u2019s training about the projected savings at the end of the loan cycle.  As they work with the communal bank they will learn to save and to share with their friends every 14 days.\r\n\r\nYina (the president) sells cosmetics as a street vendor.

Julio's farmland is located in the province of La Mar-Ayacucho, Peru. His lands are expansive and the care he provides has made them one of the best crops in the area. It's for this reason that when he goes to sell his coffee, cocoa and cocoa leaves in the city of San Francisco he obtains very good prices due to the quality of the products. What he enjoys most about his work is sowing his lands and making them fertile. He has been doing this activity of 32 years and considers the most difficult task to be keeping his crops safe from plagues. With time, he wants to purchase more lands in other areas so he can increase his products and add more variety of products. This is his 16th loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he knows that he has to pay on time if he wants to be granted more loans in the future.

Along with this business, he sells freezers and refrigerators, both new and second-hand.\r\nWith the approach of the hot season, during which there is greater demand for freezers, he decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso (one of Kiva's field partners). He is on his first loan, which he intends to use to buy 2 freezers. He gets his supplies in Gao.\r\nMr. Cheick Ahamed Tidiane T. sells his goods in cash and on credit to a clientele composed of men and women.\r\nHe intends to realize a monthly profit of 75,000 FCFA, which will serve to repay his loan and to pay a portion of his daily expenses. His goal is to further develop his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":714617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy freezers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cheick Ahamed Tidiane ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":42240.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201361236},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:19Z","rounded_local_amount":42240.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226516},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":42240.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301358},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":42240.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580929},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:10Z","rounded_local_amount":42240.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750754},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":42240.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120069}],"funded_date":"2011-03-04T19:42:14Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":278480,"name":"Abdoulaye","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Abdoulaye C. est un homme mari\u00e9 de 26 ans et p\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant qui vit avec sa femme et son enfant chez son p\u00e8re, \u00e0 Bougouni dans le quartier Massablacoura.\nAyant vite abandonn\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9cole, il d\u00e9cida d\u2019apprendre le m\u00e9tier de tailleur aupr\u00e8s de son oncle.\nDe nos jours, Abdoulaye a 12 ann\u00e9es d\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine qu\u2019il ma\u00eetrise bien et dans lequel il est tr\u00e8s sollicit\u00e9 et appr\u00e9ci\u00e9.\nPour renforcer ses activit\u00e9s, il d\u00e9cida d\u2019int\u00e9grer le programme de cr\u00e9dit de Soro Yiriwaso, avec qui il est \u00e0 sa premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience.\nAvec ce pr\u00eat il compte acheter des tissus pour les coudre et les vendre \u00e0 des particuliers et aux commer\u00e7ants.\nIl s\u2019approvisionne \u00e0 Bamako aupr\u00e8s des grossistes. \nIl compte r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice mensuel 35 000 FCFA.\nAvec ce b\u00e9n\u00e9fice il compte am\u00e9liorer son atelier afin d\u2019attirer plus de clients et contribuer aux d\u00e9penses de la famille.\n","en":"Mr. Abdoulaye C. is 26, married and the father of one child.

Father\u2019s Day is approaching and she is preparing merchandise for this season.
