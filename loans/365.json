The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Gradualmente reuni\u00f3 un capital,  producto de su esfuerzo,  perseverancia y disciplina, que le sirvi\u00f3 para afiliarse a una empresa y poder exhibir productos mediante gu\u00edas especializadas, construyendo as\u00ed su propia clientela, que la impuls\u00f3 a incursionar en la venta de otras mercanc\u00edas  solicitadas  que no encontraban en la revista para la cual trabajaba. \n\nCon el  incremento de sus ingresos empez\u00f3 a comprar por vol\u00famenes pero su mercanc\u00eda no estaba protegida, pues no tenia donde guardarlas y se le dificultaba el control de sus inventarios;esta forma de trabajar la manten\u00eda mucho tiempo fuera de su hogar, razones por las que se esforz\u00f3 para comprar vitrinas que protegieran sus productos y los exhibieran  en un sitio fijo, para ello pens\u00f3 en abrirle un espacio a este prop\u00f3sito en su vivienda, una Miscel\u00e1nea que todos en su barrio y en los alrededores ahora conocen.

The neighborhood is characterized by houses that were raised with great effort by its inhabitants.\n\nMyriam is a natural businesswoman.  She started her first business in 1998 when her husband was suddenly left without work.  She needed to figure out how to meet the family commitments, especially those related to her children\u2019s education and the general household expenses.  This situation led her to discover her business potential.  \n\nThat is how she came, for the first time, to sell beauty products that she got from a friend.  She could not do it directly because she did not have money to start, and she lacked a credit history because she was not known in the business.\n\nGradually, through her effort, perseverance, and discipline, she got together the capital to affiliate herself with a business.  She was able to display her products through special guides and build her own customer base.  This drove her to start selling other requested merchandise that could not be found in her business\u2019 magazine.\n\nWith the increase in earnings, she started to buy in bulk.  But, her merchandise was not protected, and she did not have a place to store it.  It was difficult to control her inventory.  This work kept her away from home a lot.  That is why she put forth much effort to buy display cases to protect her products and display them in a fixed place.  She thought of opening a place in her home.  It is a small general store, and everyone in the neighborhood and surrounding area knows it.  She has overcome many difficulties.  The most difficult happened when the business was more prosperous, and she was self-sufficient without the need of going into debt.  Her little granddaughter became ill, and part of her capital went towards her granddaughter\u2019s recuperation.  \n\nThat was when she turned to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, for the first time, to look for help.  Her new loan will help her to buy beauty products, hygiene products, decorations, underwear, items for the home, and merchandise like clothing for women and men that she still sells through catalogs.\n\nHer biggest dream is to separate the business from her family life in order to effectively balance her work life and her personal home life.  She plans to organize a place independent from her house and gradually buy new showcases for her merchandise.  To do this, Myriam, with her husband, will work by doubling her efforts.\n\n    \n \n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

ties of poverty. She is the mother of three children. As a mother with big dreams, in 2006, she joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), a micro-finance institution and KIVA partner in the Philippines. Since then, Andrea started selling rice and direct selling Avon products and this really helped to meet their needs. \n\nNow on her sixth loan, she proposes to use the loan amount of 28,000 pesos to purchase more inventory for her business. Specifically, the loan funds will be used to pay for 16 sacks of rice and to purchase Avon products. She hopes that, with the help of ASHI as a KIVA field partner, she can reach her ambition to step out from poverty, expand her business and pay for her three children's needs in school until they complete college degrees.\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":531906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

Y. is from the village of Colupan Bajo, Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Juliet has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 1,750 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Juliet joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juliet has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business. Juliet is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase feed. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Juliet from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 31 years old, single and the mother of a one year old baby. She finished high school and went on to conclude her teacher's training. She lives in her own home with her son and supports three nephews\/nieces who live with her. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing her teacher's training she decided to build her house. Her father had a big lot of land and divided it between his children. She was one of the beneficiaries and built her home on that lot. She has been a teacher for more than 8 years. She works from 12:15pm to 5:40pm and makes 5,900 meticais per month which is spent with household expenses and construction. She only manages to save a little because she has a domestic helper who makes 1,000 meticais per month to help her around the house. \r\n\r\nShe has had a loan with BIM (another bank) and was successful paying it back. This is her first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. It is for 15,000 meticais and she intends to buy construction materials (cement, sand, tiles and others) to continue the house construction she started with the loan from BIM. \r\n\r\nShe is confident she will pay the loan ahead of schedule and request a new loan to furnish her house offering better living conditions to her family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gabriel, who has over seven years of experience in the pest control industry, launched his business in early May, 2011 after months of planning and preparation.  The grand opening of his business is timely, as it marks the beginning of the summer season, the busiest time of the year for the pest control industry.\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in Mexico, Gabriel came to the United States 14 years ago.  Before working in pest control, he worked for several years as a salesman in the music industry.  This experience took him all over the state of Texas and Northern Mexico.  From his accumulated experience, Gabriel half-jokingly says that if there is one thing he has learned about Americans, it is that they love good customer service.   Knowing this, he sees excellent customer service as being as much a part of his business as the expertise he provides.  He says that it is crucial to build and maintain customer relationships, because satisfied customers are the cheapest form of advertising.  As he points out, someone can look up pest control companies in the phonebook, but they are most likely to work with a company recommended to them by a friend.\r\n\r\nAs a native Spanish speaker, Gabriel says that being bilingual is helping him find a niche for his business within the Hispanic community.  \u201cThere is a lot of competition in this industry, but Hispanics are looking for someone they can speak Spanish with, and I think that helps me.  I\u2019m not the only one (who speaks Spanish), but I\u2019m one of the only ones with his own company.\u201d  Though he wants to continue building relationships within the Hispanic community, he also wants to connect his business with the greater community.  One way he is doing this is by going through neighborhoods, meeting people, and making them aware of the services he offers.\r\n\r\nThis loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana helps Gabriel pay the necessary fees for registering his business. He says that the government has strict requirements for pest control, and that navigating through the paperwork can be as expensive as it is time-consuming.  It is important that he be officially registered and certified so that he can offer all of his expertise.  For example, he has yet to receive approval to treat termites, leaving him unable to provide one of the key services his business offers.  \r\n\r\nAside from helping Gabriel receive all of the necessary certifications, this loan is helping him purchase business cards and launch a small marketing campaign.  He wants to advertise his business in local newspapers and magazines.  Gabriel has already undertaken a less expensive form of advertising by walking through neighborhoods and handing out business fliers.  Before receiving this loan, Gabriel financed his startup costs with his personal savings and credit

This will will affect her work positively and let her do more high quality work and increase her income to live in better conditions.   Kifah is photographed in her office.

is a farmer in the Santa Lucia County, where he has lived for twenty years. He is 63 years old, but he still has the will to work and provide for his family. He has a 14 year-old that he wants to make sure finishes school. Manuel is hoping to receive the loan in order to improve the production of his lands. He will primarily buy fertilizer and fumigation equipment. He and his wife Benita hope to save for the future of their son. <\/p>\r\n<<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Manuel is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":25065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T17:31:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T00:51:50Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":71.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21391},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:16:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40777},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:10:13Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45296},{"amount":328,"local_amount":328,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:08:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":328,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99050},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:50:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106810}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T00:51:50Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:50:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11747,"name":"Elvia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvia is involved in the sale of general and paper products.

This is 37-year-old Ester K. from Dar es Salaam. She is married and has two children, ages 5 and 9. Ester has been running a poultry business since 2002. Raising kuku (kuku means chicken in Swahili) is popular in Tanzania for a number of reasons. Firstly, raising chickens requires little start-up capital. You can start with a few and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Her business is doing well. She works at the business for eight hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by one employee. Esther currently earns about $200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $750 USD to buy more chicks and their feed. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Esther thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":212567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase chicks and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-11T16:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-25T18:12:51Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348073},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970659},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886876},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436136},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:26Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130409},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027211},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613249},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010332},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232643},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664459}],"funded_date":"2008-10-11T18:12:51Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kay and Fred Tierney","image":92188}},{"id":73211,"name":"Susan Karin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Susan es socia de Bancomunal El Pino.

Enclaro Vista Aligre, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  food vending and nipa (palm leaves that are woven together and used as roofing material). Her husband, Leopoldo, who is 56 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are 10 to  24 years old. \r\n\r\nRosie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000 \u2014 increasing the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to lease nipa so that she could continue to save up for their future.  Rosie M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon \u2014 a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and

With the two motorbikes operational he will be able to repay the loan without fail. Motorbike transportation is emerging as a quicker alternative to bicycle transportation known as Boda Boda.

Besides paying for school fees and general expenses, she is using her profits to build a house on land that she recently purchased.\r\n<p>\r\nEarlier this year, Haelen took out a loan which helped her move her shop to a different location.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

S. (0) is a 39-year-old female living in the town of Melaya, Bali.  Ni Made is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by MUK.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is Wisma Cempaka 2 (MUK-0019).\r\n\r\n\r\nNi Made is married and has two adult children.  To make a living, Ni Made owns & operates a general store selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Ni Made has been engaged in this business for over one year and earns approximately 200,000 IDR a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ni Made joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ni Made is requesting her first loan from MUK.  She is requesting a loan of 2,500,000 IDR, which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the first loan taken out by Ni Made from MUK.  Ni Made plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout MUK:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to Kiva Lenders: This group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender. This is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner MUK will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers.\u00a0 As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click on the following link: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking\r\n\r\n\r\nNi Made R. S. (0) merupakan 39 tahun wanita.  Dia (perempuan) tinggal di kota Melaya - Bali.  Ni Made adalah pemimpin kelompok sebuah kelompok peminjam yang terdiri atas 4 anggota.  Meskipun setiap anggota kelompok menerima pinjaman perorangan, mereka semua bertanggung jawab untuk mengembalikan pinjaman rekan anggota kelompok mereka jika ada yang menunggak atau gagal membayar.  Nama resmi kelompok peminjam ini adalah Wisma Cempaka 2 (MUK-0019).\r\n\r\n\r\nMeskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari menjual produk makanan & barang kebutuhan sehari-hari di tengah masyarakat setempat.  Ni Made sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 1 tahun.  Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, Ni Made menghasilkan sekitar 200,000 IDR.  Dalam 2010, Ni Made bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan  -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis.  Ni Made meminta pinjaman untuk pertama kalinya dari MUK.    Dia (perempuan) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 2,500,000 IDR.\r\n\r\n\r\nPinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.\r\n\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\n\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\r\n\r\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon kunjungi website ini: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking.  \"\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":523934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To invest in expanding the business\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-04-14T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Made ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":10000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":10000000,"processed_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10146200.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206189220}],"funded_date":"2010-04-16T12:10:14Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:28:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":196983,"name":"Harun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Harun is a 44 year old commercial dairy farmer.

","en":"In a very commercial sector of Carrera 77, in the area of Engativ\u00e1 in the city of Bogot\u00e1, 66-year-old Jos\u00e9 Rodrigo has a photography store and darkroom that provides the income to support his family. He is a married man with 6 children between the ages of 25 and 37, and he began his business 45 years ago in a darkroom. After that, he started a business of his own on the site where it has been for 32 years: in Santa Elenita.

After moving to the United States in 1998, Rocio knew that opening her own business was a natural choice. \u201cAll of my family does this job. It\u2019s what I know and what I learned. When I first came here it was really hard to find a job; instead, I went into business for myself and began selling crafts on the street in downtown San Francisco,\u201d said Rocio. \r\n\r\nRocio and her husband Alejandro now own a small store, Inkza Crafts, in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, and also sell their goods at festivals around the Bay Area. Rocio handles the store\u2019s marketing, customer relations, and inventory while Alejandro manages the accounting and administrative aspects of the business. \r\n\r\nHer favorite part about owning a small business, Rocio explained, is being a part of her community. \u201cEach day I am able to meet and make connections with the people around me. I feel free.\u201d As their own bosses, Rocio and Alejandro are able to spend more time with their children. \u201cOur kids can be part of our work. They come to fairs with us and enjoy the food and all the people.\u201d \r\n\r\nOne quarter of the merchandise found in Inkza Crafts is designed by Rocio herself, while the remaining inventory is made by indigenous artists throughout Latin America. The store\u2019s success since opening in 2003 has allowed Rocio to work more on her own designs, and she recently has started to sell her products wholesale. A few stores around the Bay Area now sell her jewelry and crafts, and she is excited to increase that number over the next year. \r\n\r\nRocio and Alejandro first came to Opportunity Fund in 2007 and, using two successive micro loans, were able to build up their inventory and expand their business. Unfortunately, their store was damaged and items were stolen during a recent break-in. A $3,000 micro loan will help them to replace this lost inventory. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":731200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to replace inventory after a robbery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Francisco, CA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":132,"posted_date":"2011-03-18T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":308.31},{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":328.93},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":330.58},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333.29},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":335.11},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":337.39},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":339.92},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":342.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":344.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.31},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.93},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.58},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.29},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":335.11},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.39},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":339.92},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":342.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":344.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":308.31,"local_amount":308.31,"processed_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":308.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206209514},{"amount":328.93,"local_amount":328.93,"processed_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":328.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211284827},{"amount":330.58,"local_amount":330.58,"processed_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-25T08:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":330.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217381939},{"amount":333.29,"local_amount":333.29,"processed_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-18T07:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":333.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221734789},{"amount":335.11,"local_amount":335.11,"processed_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-27T08:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":335.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227105069},{"amount":337.39,"local_amount":337.39,"processed_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-20T08:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":337.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232866402},{"amount":339.92,"local_amount":339.92,"processed_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-18T09:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":339.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238682474},{"amount":342.01,"local_amount":342.01,"processed_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":342.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244637962},{"amount":344.46,"local_amount":344.46,"processed_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-19T09:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":344.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250854382}],"funded_date":"2011-03-21T21:02:54Z","paid_date":"2012-01-19T09:09:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":287132,"name":"18-4-78 Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"T\u01b0\u01a1ng N.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund's integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Phylis will educate her children and invest in livestock rearing. \r\n\r\nPhylis is pictured with her group members in the above photograph. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":915230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T17:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phylis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vivian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roselyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":47600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":47600,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":49864.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680735}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T10:24:20Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":360928,"name":"Rosette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosette is a 39-year-old single parent living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

Tiene m\u00e1s de 4 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y en este tiempo su madre es quien la apoyo atendiendo a los clientes. Le gusta su negocio pues le permite estar en casa y poder cuidar de su hijo menor, as\u00ed como el ingreso econ\u00f3mico que le apoya para pagar la alimentaci\u00f3n y vestir de su hijo y de ella misma, ya que con la pensi\u00f3n que le pasa su ex pareja y padre de su hijo, no le alcanza.

The income also allows her to pay to feed and clothe him and she, since the support she gets from her former husband is not enough.  Now she\u2019s comfortable financially and also plans to open a grocery store at her parent\u2019s house, since they support her in everything she does.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan through MFP and it will allow her to solidify her plans.

She not only takes care of her children but has to take care of her two young nieces aged 7 and 5 who have lost both their parents. Mamojalefa lives in a traditional hut that is not well ventilated, nor warms up well in winter. She works long hours to ensure there is enough food for her children who are still going to school and only help her in the field on Saturdays and Sundays. She has to wake up very early, between 3am and 4am, during the week to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water and warming the house for her children before they go to school. Collecting firewood, setting up the fire and doing the actual cooking demands a lot of her time. Temperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high; winters can get very cold and often Marelebohile has to start the fire inside her hut. Starting a fire often releases smog and smoke which when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time can lead to lung diseases, eye problems and in the worst case to death. In these circumstances, life for women like Marelebohile has been very difficult.\n\nACE has requested a loan from Kiva lenders, in order to be able to sell on credit clean cook stoves which provide women like Marelebohile the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families, and that does not require a lot of wood, which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor expensive paraffin and gas . This stove can  be started with the use of very little, readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the homes. This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones and a mini LED lamp. A life improving package for these women. This stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates the element of toxic inhalation, house burning and has given them the freedom to have a better lit home to see better in the evening while cooking and enables children to do their homework."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1869906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Green"],"use":"To be able to pay for the ACE cook stoves that are sold on credit so as to improve their lives in terms of the time they spend in homes collecting firewood for cooking.

Her dream is to get together a trousseau for each of her children. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":233020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of peanuts and millet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":31250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:26:58Z","rounded_local_amount":64501.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889508},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":32250.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440291},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":32250.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135664},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":32250.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033465},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":32250.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620832},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":32250.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019814},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":32250.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242584}],"funded_date":"2009-01-02T00:44:26Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":81435,"name":"Pring","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Pring H. is a villager in Andoung Village in Kandal Province.

that his family never goes without their daily bread. He is married and has two children. Berdimurod has a general store where he sells different kinds of foodstuffs, etc.. With a starting capital of 500 USD, thanks to perseverance and dedication, he began this enterprise 8 years ago. \r\n\r\nOver time, he expanded his business and today this has  become a family business and his daughter and son are also engaged in this business. Today he needs to buy additional foodstuffs to increase the range of his goods. With this purpose in mind,  he is requesting a loan of  800 USD for a term of 9 months. He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once in a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business. \r\n      \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Vive con su esposo y sus siete hijos. \n\nLa comunidad en la cual vive do\u00f1a Ofelia se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nDesde hace dos a\u00f1os do\u00f1a Ofelia se ha involucrado en la producci\u00f3n de leche y queso como una forma de generar ingresos para su familia. Dice estar muy contenta porque gracias a este proyecto ha podido salir adelante y ayudarle a su esposo con los gastos de la casa y de los ni\u00f1os. Adem\u00e1s, la actividad ha involucrado desde su inicio a toda la familia; su esposo la ayuda con el orde\u00f1o y los ni\u00f1os ayudan con el pastoreo de las vacas en los ratos libres despu\u00e9s de la escuela.\n\nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive do\u00f1a Ofelia es famoso en todo Costa Rica. Es un queso fresco que se le conoce tradicionalmente como \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d. A los \u201cticos\u201d (como se les conoce a los habitantes de Costa Rica) les gusta mucho consumir este producto; se le encontrar\u00e1 en las mesas acompa\u00f1ando cualquier tipo de comida, especialmente en los desayunos  junto a tortillas, arroz, frijoles, huevos, el t\u00edpico \u201cgallo pinto\u201d, entre otra variedad de comidas.  Por esta raz\u00f3n, el mercado para dicho producto es realmente bueno.\n\nDo\u00f1a Ofelia  desea obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito por un monto de \u00a2500.000 (quinientos mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera m\u00e1s y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche. Ella sabe que contar con una vaca m\u00e1s es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo. Sin embargo, el deseo de ser una microempresaria exitosa y  sacar adelante a su familia mejorando las condiciones de vida, la motiva a esforzarse con gran esmero y dedicaci\u00f3n.\n\nDo\u00f1a Ofelia es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la micro financiera EDESA.

R., 53, lives with her husband and their seven children. \r\n\r\nOfelia lives in the El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba community, in the Cartago province.  It is a small, rural community of approximately two thousand inhabitants.  The inhabitants work in milk production and coffee farming.  The landscape is very irregular, and much of the land is maintained as tropical rainforest.  The community has very picturesque scenery that combines the tropical rainforest with two pretty ponds, coffee plantations, and dairies.  El Sauce is located at about one and a half hours by bus from Turrialba, which is the closest commercial center.  Nevertheless, several times a year the road is impassable because of the rains.  This is, without a doubt, one of the major challenges for the community.\r\n \r\nWhen there weren\u2019t many jobs, many people chose to leave to look for work in Turrialba or in banana plantations located on the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica.  Lately the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so now people from the area are looking for ways to invest in projects in their own area and avoid migrating.\r\n\r\nFor the past two years Ofelia has been involved in milk and cheese production as a way to generate income for her family.  She is very happy because this work has allowed her to get ahead and to help her husband with the expenses of the children and the house.  Also, the whole family is involved.  Her husband helps her with the milking, and the children help with the care and feeding of the cows during their free time after school.\r\n\r\nThe cheese from the region where Ofelia lives is famous throughout Costa Rica. It is a fresh cheese that is traditionally known as \u201cTurriabla Cheese.\u201d Ticos (a nick-name for the people of Costa Rica) like to buy Turrialba cheese to eat with any type of food, but especially at breakfast, along with tortillas, rice, beans, and eggs.  That is why the market for these products is good.\r\n\r\nOfelia would like a micro loan for the amount of $900 (500,000 colones) to buy another milk cow and increase the milk production.  She knows that having another cow is a big sacrifice and will require more work.  Nevertheless, the desire to be a successful microentreprenuer and improve the family living conditions motivates her to put forth great effort and dedication.\r\n\r\nOfelia is a client of the Producers Association of El Sauce, a local partner organization of the microfinance organization EDESA.  Thanks to her ties to this organization, she has received 7 micro-loans and she has repaid them satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

They have one child who is five years old. \r\n\r\nRowena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $288, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 8th loan, she is borrowing 19,500 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for buying cashew nuts and more stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future. Rowena I. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -- a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/team\/nwtf_philippines\">NWTF Kiva lending team<\/a> on

She lives with her husband and their 2 children in their own house. For over 30 years, she has worked helping her husband, who is a locksmith and maker of wrought-iron furniture, in the workshop in the front part of their home. For Elena, the days are hard work. In the mornings she prepares food for the family and the employees who work with her husband, and in the afternoons she is busy sewing: making upholstered covers for the furniture her husband makes. In this way, she is in charge of putting the finishing touches to the furniture they make, and these are well-received by her customers. What she likes best about her job is the freedom she has in her work, and also the fact it is so profitable. Going forward, she hopes to enlarge the business and get better tools to work with. This is her 9th loan from [field partner] MFP, and she promises to make her repayments on time. The others in her communal bank consider her a very pleasant member of the group. With the loan she is seeking, she will buy iron, and thus increase her stock of materials to continue working and have peace of mind.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":666345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To buy iron and tools she needs for her workshop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-15T22:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":290.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":309.98},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":330.82},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":341.43},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":355.69},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":371.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.77},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.93},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":105.25,"local_amount":290.34,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":296.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463646},{"amount":112.37,"local_amount":309.98,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:17Z","rounded_local_amount":316.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887026},{"amount":119.92,"local_amount":330.82,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:04Z","rounded_local_amount":337.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327385},{"amount":123.77,"local_amount":341.43,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":348.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195946},{"amount":128.93,"local_amount":355.69,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":363.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269626},{"amount":134.76,"local_amount":371.74,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":379.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549618}],"funded_date":"2010-12-16T03:34:13Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":262560,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is 27 years old and married.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a pig fattening and a food vending business. Her husband Saol H., who is 56 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 5 children who are between 15 and 32 years old. Melly joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Melly has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,800, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to pay for more funds in business operations so that she can continue to save up for family needs and her children\u2019s education. Melly is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He has children who are 18, 20, 13 and 28 years old, and his business is the sale of charque(dried meat).\r\n\r\nHe is enterprising, independent, steady, responsible and hard-working.  Erasmo  carries out his business in the community  of  Alto Pe\u00f1as, noted for its nearness to sacred Lake Titicaca.  This is an agricultural area where livestock is raised:  beef cattle, sheep and camelids (llamas).  People eat fish and also the cereals and vegetables of the areas, such as quinoa, chu\u00f1o, beans, and potatoes.  The area is known for its cold climate, with temperature varying during the day between 1 and 12 degrees Centigrade.  The sun's rays strike the earth strongly.\r\n\r\nErasmo is dark-skinned, with short black hair, and is  short in stature. His native language is Aymar\u00e1,  the language spoken in the area.  He speaks Spanish as a matter of general knowledge and for his business.  Erasmo shares his life with his wife who works at farming, and with his two younger sons, since the older ones are already on their own.  The family lives in a house built of adobe with a straw roof, which has electricity and well water.  \r\n\r\nHis business is the preparation and sale of charque, meat which is covered with salt and placed in the sun until it is dry. This method is used to preserve meat for long periods of time.  Erasmo makes his sales in neighboring communities and also in the city.  Many kinds of food are cooked using this product.  \"Charque can be cooked or eaten raw, since the sun's rays have cooked it, \" he says.  Erasmo's dream is to have a greenhouse for growing vegetables.  He wants to buy beef cattle to slaughter and produce a large amount of charque.  This is the first loan for him with the institution in the six years he has been working at this activity.  These are the reasons why Erasmo is asking for a loan to buy beef cattle to slaughter and produce charque to sell.

The family lives together in their own home. At 20 years old he made a living clearing land, working for his neighbors. He was an expert in stripping vegetation. Later, he planted a half-hectare of achiote (a typical regional berry) which allowed him to earn money so he could lease a farm to which he could devote all his attention and dedication. Now, with the help of his wife, his work is more pleasant, and at this time he is trying to increase every one of his crops. His only difficulty is that the land is not yet his own, but keep in mind his first coffee harvest went well. His immediate goal is to buy one or two hectares so that with time he can increase his production with the security to fertilize his own crops so that his harvests are very profitable and he can provide for his family's comfort and well-being. <p>\r\nReginaldo shows himself to be a very active member of his community bank and is always available to provide whatever service is needed.

A. is thirty-one years old and married. His wife is a business lady and they have three children aged between twelve years old and two years old whom they hope to give quality education to the university level. \r\n\r\nHis business is located in a residential area with many small businesses called Mishomoroni in Mombasa. Mombasa is the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many tourist attraction sites, not forgetting the Indian Ocean white beaches. He has a barber shop which he has been operating for the last six years and he has provided employment to one person. \r\n\r\nBesides this business he also has a small mobile phone accessories shop in the same area. He says that this business is good and his major challenge is lack of enough working capital. He works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep his business doing well. He is using his loan of Kes 40,000 to buy shaving machines and a sterilising machine which will help him serve more clients while giving them good service. He hopes to open many barber shops and be a prominent businessman in future. He describes himself as very honest, faithful and

Monthly, she earns an estimated net income of around Php 8,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 21,000 loan.  She plans to use this amount to pay for the purchase of additional grocery items to restock her inventory.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Manuela Elizabeth will buy wafers, bags, tape, and boxes for repackaging the wafers.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Gudelia Elizabeth is 42 years old and studied through the third year of high school.  She is married and has three children, two sons and a daughter.  The two younger children are high school students.  They live in a town that is known for growing amaranth used in making amaranth candy, milk candy, wafers, granola, peanut brittle, coconut candy, and other sweets.  Gudelia Elizabeth has a store where she sells clothing and gifts.  She is requesting a loan to buy clothes such as trousers, blouses, skirts, men\u2019s slacks, boys' undershirts, plush toys, and uniforms for elementary and high school students.  Gudelia Elizabeth started her business four years ago.  Along with her sister, she established a clothing and gift shop and each of them contributed $7000 which they used to travel to Mexico City to stock up on merchandise.  This business is important to Gudelia Elizabeth because it provides work and income for her family.  Also, the goods are not perishable.  She enjoys her business because it has helped her family financially.  Her children do not lack anything because they take any school uniforms that have not been sold.  When Gudelia Elizabeth goes out to collect payments, she takes her children with her so that they can attend to the customers.  Her business is popular because of the good prices for her products and the payment options offered to her customers.  The challenges her business faces include the rising costs of uniforms from her distributors, who mark up the price before classes start.  Gudelia Elizabeth hopes and dreams of continuing her sales so that her children can continue studying.\r\n<p>\r\nThe members of this group are very grateful to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the loans that have been provided and the continued support.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":855371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy trousers, blouses, skirts, men\u2019s slacks, boys' undershirts, plush toys, and school uniforms.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 78 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  As the Kiva group representative, Esther is pictured on the right of the group with her hand raised.\r\n\r\nEsther is 52 years old and has been a farmer for 10 years.  Esther works as a farmer to provide for her six children.  The community and other farmers know Esther as friendly.  Other than farming, she is also involved in her community in the prayer group.  Esther described her harvest last year as not with One Acre Fund, but hopes she can have a better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nEsther joined One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Esther joined One Acre Fund so that she could get the best seed prices.  Because she wants to help more farmers, Esther has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. In the future, Esther hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school and invest in a business.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nEsther and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

The women are married and some are widows with children and orphans who go to school.  Women of Kaweluwelu have successfully repaid previous loans from MicroLoan Foundation. They started their businesses for different reasons, for example to be able to pay school fees for their families and to support their families financially. \r\n\r\nGenerally the women of Kaweluwelu run small-scale businesses such as raising and selling chickens; some own market stalls selling kaunjika (second-hand clothes) and some run grocery shops selling assorted items. Their husbands are also doing businesses and some are employed. The group is requesting this loan from Kiva lenders to purchase chicken feed, bales of Kaunjika (second-hand clothes), renovating the Kraal (corral) and labour charges.\r\n\r\n Mirriam, 56, is married to Cosmas, 63 years old. She is in a purple blouse with a file folder in her hands. Mirriam has four children and four orphans who go to school. She raises and sells broiler chickens and her husband owns a grocery shop. She wants this loan to buy chicken feed from Mzuzu city and to renovate the Kraal. The remaining amount will be used for labour charges for renovation. She works from home and her family members help in the daily activities.\r\n\r\nSince she started receiving loans, she is able to increase her flock of chickens raised. She started with 50 chicks and now she has 150 chickens. In the future she has plans to use any profit made to build a house for rent. Mirriam believes that the training she received on \u2018Business Management\u2019 will help her to achieve what she wants from her business. As a woman she has managed to purchase household equipment and she is able to feed her family without involving her husband.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1628276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase chicken feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MW","country":"Malawi","town":"MZUZU","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.5 34","type":"point"}},"partner_id":381,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":5850,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliness","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maggie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndindase","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Twambilire","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MWK","disbursal_amount":2300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":5850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":384000},{"due_date":"2014-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":384000},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":383000},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":383000},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":383000},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":383000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":976.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":976.7},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":974.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":974.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":974.15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":974.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":767229,"name":"Avo Group","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe AVO est compos\u00e9 de trois personnes qui r\u00e9sident dans la m\u00eame maison.

years ago Hilda decided to dedicate herself to becoming a beautician.  She is married with an 18 year-old son and three daughters.  Her husband works as a welder at a quarry, but his salary does not cover the family's expenses.  Hilda therefore decided to earn some extra money to pay the bills and so that her children could stay in school.  It is also an area that interests her.\r\n<p>\r\nHilda started off just cutting hair, but after requests from her clients she has prepared herself to offer other beauty treatments.  To improve the quality of her service she now needs a loan of $475 which she will use to buy hair dye, salon materials and other products used in her line of work.  She promises to repay the loan over a period of 6-12 months.  With your help you can contribute to the growth of her business and improve her family's life.
