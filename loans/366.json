This time, for her fourth loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use to buy stocks for the general store and feed for the piggery, so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and the expansion of her piggery. Criselda T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\nIn a world full of challenges Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference to the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Melita is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"Melita G.\u2019s Group\". \r\n\r\nMelita is 47 years old, married and blessed with seven children of whom three are now adults and the other four are school-aged. To make a living, she is presently engaged in \u201ckangkong\u201d (a vegetable like spinach) vending and laundry activity. Her husband is a farmer. She\u2019s been engaged in this kind of business for 10 years already. She\u2019s earning an average amount of not less than Php 2,000 a month from these activities. \r\n\r\nIn September 2007, Melita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  As an active member of Paglaum MPC under the PDP-LP, a micro-finance program that reaches out to rural communities, Melita has successfully repaid a loan amount of Php3,000. She is now requesting a loan of Php 5,000 as her 6th loan which will be used for  house repairs and renovation. She joined Paglaum MPC because she is very much interested in the programs and services offered, especially savings and insurance.\r\n\r\n About PMPC:\r\n\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":730440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal

This is why he\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan to buy beer and soft-drinks at wholesale so that he can gradually become a distributor to businesses at the beach near him so that when they run out of beverages due to the heavy consumption that takes place in this port on weekends, he will be able to help them meet their needs.\r\n\r\nHis goal for later on is to remodel the terrace to make his business more pleasant and continue to enjoy pleasant conversations with his customers while generating enough income for his home.  While this occurs he works hard at his business maintaining a profit margin of no less than 40% and an inventory turnover rate of six days which we use as the basis to predict potential business growth for him.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":859931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy beer and soft drinks at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-09-05T22:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Waldo  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:04Z","rounded_local_amount":62720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614890},{"amount":35,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":62720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568839},{"amount":35,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":62720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780162},{"amount":35,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":62720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188556},{"amount":35,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":62720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324772},{"amount":175,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":313600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038832}],"funded_date":"2011-09-20T21:25:09Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":335963,"name":"Celso","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Celso, es rentista jubilado de una instituci\u00f3n p\u00fablica.

Thus his working day begins very early in the morning, walking into the jungle for 3 or 4 days to find trees that provide good wood.

She joined the Fund in 2003, asking for a loan to invest into her fruit shop at the market. Every day, she buys fruit from large retailers and resells them to the locals. Over 5 years, the funds for her fruit shop allowed her to expand the business. As of today, her family\u2019s income from the fruit business amount to around 2.500.000\u0111 per month. In order to improve further the family\u2019s income, her husband regularly works as a general labourer for a regular income of 1.500.000\u0111 per month. Thus her family\u2019s conditions are very stable and they were able to raise 2 kids. She also managed to build a spacious storey house and buy a set of valuable appliances.

Moreover, she is the mother of four children (two sons and two daughters), all of whom are currently enrolled in a local school. Shamshad baji\u2019s husband, S. S., is a painter by profession; specifically, he takes orders from his clients, and he then paints their houses. <p>\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Shamshad baji has a clothing sales business. In particular, she buys clothes from the famous city of Multan, and she later sells such clothes in her own city for a profit. She notes that she has 6 years of experience in this business, and that she does this work to pay for her children\u2019s education (i.e., she saves her income in order to cover her children's school fees). Notably, she has already successfully repaid two prior loans from Asasah (a microfinance institution of Pakistan). Now, she is applying for another loan to buy more clothes to resell. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is the group leader of three other members of her community: (1) Azhar batool baji wants a loan to buy materials (e.g., colored threads and sketches) for her carpet-making business; (2) G. khatoon baji seeks a loan to buy wood for her furniture-making business; and (3) Fatima bilal baji requests a loan to buy an auto-rickshaw (a local, three-wheeled motor vehicle). Importantly, this is a group loan: as such, the loan proceeds are distributed amongst the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business; at the same time, the members mutually guarantee one another's loans (i.e., if one member does not promptly repay her portion of the loan, then the other members are responsible for curing the arrears).

She has lived with her husband for the past 17 years, and they currently live in a rented house.\r\n\r\nThe flashflood of 2007, during which the river overflowed, causing a landslide, suspended Vilma's work, as her clothing and other merchandise were affected, ruining her sales. She started her business from scratch two years ago, and has been building it up little by little, renting a storefront and travelling to Lima every 15 days to buy merchandise. In addition she works as an aerobics instructor, earning 40 soles per week. Her husband also works selling clothes, but he takes his merchandise to other places outside of the city. When they need to make an investment they combine their weekly earnings of between 500 and 800 soles. This allows them to pay the rent on the storefront and the education expenses for their daughter, who wants to study fashion design. Vilma is very happy with her two jobs, which fill her with hope for the future, and she is thinking of building her own home.\r\n\r\nVilma is a very active member of her community bank. She is the treasurer, a position which comes with a lot of responsibility.

They are married mothers who average 38 years of age and have at least 6 children each.  They do different work, selling condiments, pasta, shoes, grains, and clothing at the wholesale level. \r\n<p>\r\nTo expand their businesses, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program three years ago.  The loan amount has gone from 50,000 francs CFA for the first loan to 125,000 francs for the fourth group loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid. \r\n<p>\r\nThe current loan will be used to buy sacks of rice, some garlic, big onions from Niono, boxes of macaroni from Ghana and Dakar, and various other goods from Abidjan (capital of Cote d'Ivoire) and from Bamako (capital of Mali).

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more rice to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613705},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010784},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233070},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664861},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105573}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T12:56:41Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Waring","image":null}},{"id":105655,"name":"Ricardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ricardo tiene 57 a\u00f1os y est\u00e1 casado con Prisciliana que tiene 54 a\u00f1os de edad.

He learned his trade from his father during his school years. Now he is passing on his experience to his own son, Jamshed. Together, they work in his studio, which is next to their house. However, the main income source for their household is from animal husbandry. Naim has 15 years of experience buying cows and sheep, fattening them up and selling them in the autumn, from which he makes a good income. His wife, Gavhar, together with their daughters Shoira and Shoista help Naim with feeding the cattle. The first time he took out a loan, he bought more cattle and operated on a much larger scale. Now he plans to take out another loan and to use it to feed the cattle. As in late September, he wishes to prepare for the celebration of the holy festival of Ramadan in which many families sacrifice cattle and give the meat to poor families and orphans. For this reason, Naim wishes to feed his cattle before the autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Josh Machleder, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":352756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"for cattle feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joshua Machleder","image":145052}},{"id":126135,"name":"Margie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margie hails from the busy town of Cardona in the Rizal province in the Philippines.

She lives in the Jadan community of Paute county, located northeast of the Azuay province. It is on the Union Natural route between the mountains and the Ecuadorian east, facilitating access to the Amazon by the rivers of Peru, which makes tourism a big potential for the local development. Furthermore, it has a mild climate, and its kind people are perfect for both national and international tourists. <p>\r\nOur client is 28 years old, single, and lives with her parents, who have worked hard to obtain their house. She helps them out with the household expenses. Gloria raises and sells chickens in her community, and she has been doing so for quite some time.

She has been working in agriculture since childhood and with her husband she grows cereals and grains such as wheat, barley, corn, beans, quinoa and peas. These are the most profitable products to sell. During the harvest season, she sells them wholesale to market traders and tries to sell them directly with no intermediaries, depending on the occasion and the market price. For this reason, she takes great care of her plantations in order to prevent pest attacks.

V. is a woman living in Soledad with her husband and two children who are 11 and 16 years of age.  She has a business that her mother started ten years ago:  she rents beach chairs at El Rodadero Beach, a beautiful sea resort in the city of Santa Marta, two hours from Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nIn time her mother sought help from her children to associate them with the business it because it grew much.  They have 320 chairs and they travel to Santa Marta every Friday through Sunday or Monday if it\u2019s a holiday.  During high tourist seasons they go all the time as well as at the end of the year and at the middle of the year.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the large number of tourists, both from all of Colombia and foreigners alike, that enjoy their rest, she also offers other products like delicious cakes, sweet hayacas (a type of tamale) and water thereby earning additional income, especially during the  high season that\u2019s about to start in this tourist destination.\r\n\r\nNelsis wants to buy 40 beach chairs and this is precisely why she\u2019s applying for a Kiva loan, her second loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, because she wants to increase profits with a larger number of beach chairs to relax in during this good season.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to buy a vehicle to use in the business because that would help transport and would pay for itself.  This is why she works so hard so that in the not too distant future she will meet this great challenge.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":655390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy 40 beach chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-11-30T23:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelsis Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":37984},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":38617},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":39260},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":39915},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40580},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41256},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41944},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":42643},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":43354},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":44076},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":44811},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":45560}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.89},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.59},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.96},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.32},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.07},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.45},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20.89,"local_amount":37984,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":39943.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688491},{"amount":21.24,"local_amount":38617,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":40609.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001149},{"amount":43.55,"local_amount":79175,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83260.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289160},{"amount":22.32,"local_amount":40580,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":42673.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157302},{"amount":22.69,"local_amount":41256,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":43384.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230314},{"amount":23.07,"local_amount":41944,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":44108.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673406},{"amount":23.45,"local_amount":42643,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":44843.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319966},{"amount":23.84,"local_amount":43354,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:44Z","rounded_local_amount":45591.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803114},{"amount":24.25,"local_amount":44076,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":46350.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614210},{"amount":24.64,"local_amount":44811,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":47123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568199},{"amount":25.06,"local_amount":45560,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":47910.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779555}],"funded_date":"2010-12-01T05:48:37Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":258107,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Josephine L. is from the barangay of Maningcol, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental.

Ysabel's favorite activity is going to church and sharing with her fellow group members.\r\n\r\nYsabel runs a business selling shoes and jewelry.  She saw the need for someone to sell gold jewelry in her community and other nearby communities and she started selling these products gradually.  After having received five loans from Esperanza she is now able to sell shoes as well.  Ysabel will invest this loan in both lines of products, devoting 50% of her loan to each.

Desde hace 10 a\u00f1os se dedica a la confecci\u00f3n de conjuntos infantiles  y multiusos que fabrica con telas, hilos, en dos m\u00e1quinas sencillas y con herramientas manuales. El arte de la costura lo aprendi\u00f3 por s\u00ed sola, pero logr\u00f3 perfeccionarlo con capacitaciones que le posibilitaron el montaje de su negocio, actividad de la cual sus hijos, personas trabajadoras y de bien, se sienten muy orgullosos de ella.

She lives in the south part of the city where she makes clothes and also has a fast food business.  She\u2019s been making children\u2019s outfits and multiple-use garments for the last 10 years with fabric and thread on two simple machines and with hand tools.  She learned the art of sewing on her own but managed to perfect it through courses that allowed her to set up her own business, work that her children who are upstanding, working people, feel very proud of her for.  Blanca also carries out another activity which is the sale of fast food, a business that operates in the morning and that only takes up two hours a day.

only one step away from being able to start her own cereal selling business, thanks to Juhudi Kilimo and the wonderful Kiva lenders. \n\nMartha is an amazing woman who is a smallholder farmer based in Kiminini village in the Kitale area of Kenya. She is married to her handsome hubby, with whom she has been together for almost a decade. She has three children who commute to school from home every school-day. Martha has been practicing livestock farming for ten years to help her husband cover family expenses.

She must also support one of her three daughters, who is studying. What her husband, who is retired as well, earns does not cover household expenses. In 2005 Maria consequently began selling cookies, but she stopped doing it when she had to frequently visit one of her daughters in the United States, who fell ill. During this time, however, a friend told her that she could take advantage of these trips to bring back used clothes and household items to sell because those items sell very well. This is how Maria began her business. She worked with somebody else so that he could watch the business while she went to the United States and spent time with her daughter.<p>\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Maria doesn't have enough merchandise to offer her customers at present. It is for this reason that she is requesting a loan of $750, which she is ready to repay over a period of 6 months.

This is 24 years old Rosemary M. from Mwanza. She is married. Rosemary has been running a African clothing business since 2008. She has established a store that sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. <p>Rosemary works at the business for 12 hours per day, 5 days per week. Rosemary currently earns about 100USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to purchase shirts, trousers and vitenge (African cloths). In the future, she plans to open another business. Rosemary thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has one child, and her husband works in a hospital in the capital, where he works in the storeroom, and he prepares nutritious food in the kitchen.  Maria used to rise early in the mornings to make her tortillas since she went out walking to sell them on the sidewalks in Managua.  She gave up her cereal and tortilla sales to work for a company called Telmark Nicaragua.  Her sales were going down, so she decided to look for work at Telmark, where they gave her a job as a janitor since they knew her.  This was a great opportunity for her since she now has a fixed salary.  But she keeps making cereal, which her coworkers buy.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she will purchase construction materials to build at least a side wall on her house, so she can close the house up little by little and have a little more security, since there is a lot of delinquency in her neighborhood.  So she needs the wall for greater security.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":487792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of construction materials such as: stone, sand, cement and iron to build a side wall on her home for security","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-02-14T05:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.38,"local_amount":667.57,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:04Z","rounded_local_amount":699.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604510},{"amount":172.7,"local_amount":3454.03,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3618.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639981},{"amount":27.25,"local_amount":545.09,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":571.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330300},{"amount":2.95,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":61.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465464},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":687.34,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":720.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097644},{"amount":46.39,"local_amount":927.87,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:39Z","rounded_local_amount":972.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348304},{"amount":42.96,"local_amount":859.29,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:50Z","rounded_local_amount":900.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195765993},{"amount":40,"local_amount":799.81,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":838,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209122}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T12:58:04Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":180089,"name":"Sorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sorn Y. is 36 years old and is a resident of Kampong Chhnang province, located about 90 km from the capital, Phnom Penh.

Akbarali is an active 38-year-old father. He is a talented farmer and his crops are sought after by many local women who would like to sell them. The income he earns from this business allows him to take care of his large family of four children and his wife. Akbarali would like to increase his harvest in order to maximize his income, and to do so he needs to buy fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. As he lacks the financial means to do so, Akbarali is requesting a loan of 7000 Somoni to help him with this purchase.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

By working hard in her Eatery and oyster vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12000. Gleceria is borrowing PHP 19000 so that she may fund operations of her eatery and oyster vending businesses. This will be her 9th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Gleceria aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nOlivia dreams of being able to renovate her house soon with all of her work with the business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family, especially in meeting their basic needs, savings for future use, loan repayments, children\u2019s education and possible business expansions.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n About PMPC:\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been married for seven years to Miguel, who is a surveyor.\r\n\r\nAs Don Miguel has stable work, Do\u00f1a Yahaira previously stayed at home taking care of the children.  As they grew up, she decided, together with her husband, to start a business to earn another source of income for the family.  She opened a food stall close to a school in the village, and this is where she sells all types of confectionery for children.  She sells churros (dough fritters), sweets, water, gum and paletas (popsicles).  Her food stall opens at five in the morning, and remains open until 5 in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nYahaira has requested her first loan of L4,000 for the purchase of products such as gum, fruit and churros to stock up her business.

from Tanzania! Lailaty is a 51-year-old single woman with four children, two of whom are in school. She is a new entrepreneur who started a Mama Lishe, or local caf\u00e9, in 2007 where she serves delicious cuisine to her customers. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that actually entails. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. \r\n<p>Lailaty\u2019s monthly profit from the caf\u00e9, where her children and two employees assist her, is approximately $US300. She is requesting a loan of $US275 in order to purchase more stocks of rice as well as additional chairs and tables to accommodate more customers. In the future, she hopes to further expand her caf\u00e9.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional foodstuffs and seating","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-18T01:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lailaty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-01T15:40:17Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":32424,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344466},{"amount":27,"local_amount":29454.55,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":31266,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347922},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:05Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970496},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886713},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435973},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130274},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027105},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:35Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613145},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:48Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010228},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232539}],"funded_date":"2008-08-18T15:40:17Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":64729,"name":"Heng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Heng P., 49, and his wife, Mrs. Samet Roen, 48, who live in a small village across Mekong River about fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh, have been married for twenty years and have seven children; two sons and five daughters.

worked in the past as a president of a small local government organization. He is 66 years old, married and has raised six children. All of his children already have their own families and everyone besides his youngest son live separately from parents.

Her business helps her community because she provides affordable food for people.\r\n<p>\r\nKiria feels that her loans through GHAPE have benefited her because the method of repayment is comfortable and convenient, and because GHAPE provides training as well as proper follow-up after the loan is disbursed to ensure that the loan is properly managed. \r\n<p>  \r\nAbout GHAPE\r\n<p>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

They have come to SMT\/Shine on Sierra Leone to seek a loan of 6,000,000 Sierra Leonean Leones for a number of reasons. As teachers\u2019 salaries are usually small, SMT\/Shine on Sierra Leone loans are very useful in helping them supplement their salaries.\r\n\r\nThis will be the first loan these teachers are accessing from SMT\/Shine on Sierra Leone and Kiva. Like most teachers in Sierra Leone, the members of this group rarely have extra income with which they can buy or do anything great. But with a loan, they can now buy or do something big and then repay over a period of time.\r\n\r\nSome of them will use their loan to begin or continue building a house, others to pay either for themselves to pursue further studies or pay for their children\u2019s education. Some will use it to invest in businesses in order to supplement their monthly salaries and still others will use theirs to buy pieces of furniture and household goods.\r\n\r\nThe leader of this group of teachers is Samuel A. T.. He is a senior teacher at the school and has been in the teaching profession for thirty-one years now. Samuel is about forty-five years old and married with four children and one foster child. Two of his children are in Junior Secondary School II, the others are not of school going age, and his foster child is in primary school II.\r\n\r\nSamuel will use this loan to buy house-building

Bayanzurh district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. She and her family live together in a ger, the Mongolian nomadic tent, in a rented plot of land with a yard. Togoosuren pays 20,000 tugrugs (about $14 US) per month in rent. She and her family have been living in their current home for five years. \r\n\r\nTogoosuren started her scarf weaving and cashmere\/camel wool\/yak hair sweater business at her home in 2004.  Originally, she would weave by hand, but she has been using two weaving machines for the business recently.

Her desire to give her children love and the best education motivated her to become a GHAPE member in 2007.  Her past loan investments are still yielding good dividends. She plans to invest this loan in the purchase of beans, palm oil, groundnuts and yams.

The group consists of 11 members, all from the same neighbourhood, from which the Banc Villageois took its name.\r\n\r\nIt is a very closely knit and supportive group, which regularly holds consultation and exchange meetings to ensure the good functioning of their businesses. It is a homogeneous group of married women, mothers of at least three children.\r\n\r\nThey are very resourceful in commercial matters, diversifying their activities: some sell incense, others seafood products, beauty products, or clothing fabrics.\r\n\r\nThe president, Mrs Fatou T., seen at the far right in the picture, wearing a red, gray and yellow square-patterned ensemble, is 45 years old. She is a very dynamic woman, who nurtures a spirit of solidarity and mutual aid within the group. She is quite strict and strong-willed and doesn\u2019t spare any efforts to maintain the good functioning of the group and the success of their business activities.\r\n\r\nShe retails clothing apparel and beauty products. She gets her supplies from Dakar, the capital of Senegal, for resale on credit in her neighbourhood. She recovers her loan payments at the end of each month. Her objective is to support her husband with their children\u2019s nourishment and education.\r\n\r\nAlthough the group only existed six months within the CAURIE-MF MFI, their members had prior experience with credit loans over the past five years. This has given them a solid commercial sense, ensuring that their first loan was reimbursed without problems, and also sustaining a good level of savings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French

He is the most experienced bricklayer to whom his neighbors come when there is a need for roofing or building of a wall.  Hernan enjoys working in construction and knows that this noble profession will enable him to pay for the education of his children.  He wants to buy more beams and struts to be able to improve his construction projects and thus improve his income.\r\nThe difficult part of his work is carrying the heavy bricks and having to handle the cement at times even with his hands. This has caused his hands to age rapidly, but has not taken away their strength nor the desire to get ahead that he carries inside him.  This is his fourth loan with MFP and he does not want to stop paying on it due to lack of money, so he is already signing more contracts for construction work. He is the only male in his community bank and always tries to be responsible and respectful with the other members.  With the money from the loan he will buy new beams and will increase the number of struts, which will allow him to work in more construction projects and improve his income<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Bobbit, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":272804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of necessary supplies for his work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T02:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hernan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:16Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117090},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012003},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595588},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989850},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210986},{"amount":42.2,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":136.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640487}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T04:01:28Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Bobbit","image":null}},{"id":93431,"name":"Ronaldo Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Ronaldo G. es muy trabajador por la raz\u00f3n de que se dedica a su actividad de elaboraci\u00f3n de canastos y otros objetos derivados del bamb\u00fa.

This is 35-year-old Sekela M. from Kyela. She is single with one child, age 12. Sekela has been running a crops-selling business since 2001. A typical maize business is a stand on the side of the road where maize is often piled high in baskets.  Customers can scrutinize the quality of the product before purchase and specify the exact amount they would like to purchase. Maize is very important to the Tanzanian culture as maize is used to make one of their staple dishes, ugali. Ugali is made solely of maize flour and water.\nShe works at the business for 9 - 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Sekela currently earns about 130USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase more beans in bulk. In the future, she plans to establish another business. Sekela thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more beans in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sekela S.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She hoped that someday through loans requested from ASHI, she would be able to have an established business to support her in bringing her family out of the umbrella of poverty.  She and her husband started cultivating a small parcel of land in their backyard, growing rice and vegetables to sell. They were both very familiar with this occupation from childhood, having learned the skills from their farmer parents. After receiving several loans since joining ASHI, their business eventually improved, as did the quality of their family life. Using her profit, Maria was able to send her two children to a vocational course in college and has been supporting the needs of her eldest child, who is unemployed due to his limited education. \r\n\r\nSince farming is the main source of Maria\u2019s financial need to support her dream of improving her family's standard of living, she hopes to make it sustainable and profitable. With more capital, she plans to purchase equipment, a variety of vegetable seedlings, and a better variety of rice seedlings to increase her sales turnover and profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n

The reason  for her kiva loan request, her sixth loan, is the desire to purchase a hot dog cart and supplies for her new products such as sausages, sauces, flour and also soft drinks.\r\n\r\nIlsy allocates her time well to each activity.  Every day she fries the arepas, empanadas and cariba\u00f1olas (yucca stuffed with meat) which are her breakfast options.  She makes the cakes on the weekends allowing the families to rest and not cook and soon she will diversify her offerings by adding fast foods which have a higher sales level on the weekend evenings from Friday to Sunday and on holidays.  Since Ilsy T. started as a client of the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, she has improved her income, her business has grown which has allowed her to improve the quality of education of her two children, 7 and 12 years of age.  Her goals are focused on further growing her business, especially having a space with a structure that befits her activity of making food.  She is very fortunate in terms of her location as she lives in the Las Nieves neighborhood, a community that maintains the happy profile of the people of Barranquillera which attracts customers during festivities and recreational events and strengthens her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Bobbit, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":605446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of hot dog cart and raw materials for her new products such as sausages,sauces, flour and refreshments.

is pleased to present to you teachers of the Kulafai Rashedeen Primary School, Mafuki village, 3 miles to Lunsar, a town in northern Sierra Leone. This school was founded in 1982 by the Kulafai Rashedeen Mission. The school is currently staffed with 37 teachers and has an enrollment of 550 pupils. This is the first loan that teachers of this institution have benefited from Kiva lenders. \n\nEdward F. is a teacher at the school and leader of this group. Edward is approximately forty year old and was born in Lunsar, in northern Sierra Leone. He has been in the teaching profession for fourteen years now. Edward is married and has four children. He has requested for a loan of SLL 800,000.00 in order to invest in business. Edward will buy locally produce goods like palm-oil and rice at large quantity for sale. \n\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish some certain tasks that they would otherwise have not been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":714682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buys locally produce goods like palm-oil and rice at large quantity for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Lunsar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2011-03-11T05:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edward \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamed S.

It should be said that the business group Farijika consists primarily of women.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":779758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy four baskets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

They live together in a home they own in the district of Pichari, Peru. For the past couple years Norma has made a living selling snacks at a cafe in La Victoria education center in Pichari. At first she didn't know anything, but thanks to the lessons of her parents she knew how to find the gift she had inside herself. It's for this reason her customers feel satisfied. However, her life wasn't always filled with joy because there were times when she didn't have customers. When she started working, her primary tool was a tricycle she used to transport and sell her snacks. Norma knows that her humble beginnings were rather difficult, but she worked hard to make it worth the trouble. Thanks to her perseverance, now she is happy with the business she has, and is grateful to Kiva partner MFP at the same time for giving her this loan to help her increase her capital. Now all she does is provide good products at reasonable prices, and what matters most is the special treatment she offers to all of her customers. This is her first loan with MFP, and she promises to make her payments on time. Norma feels happy and grateful to her community bank for welcoming her with open arms.
