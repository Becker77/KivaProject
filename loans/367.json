Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica.

J. is 37 years old. He lives with his wife and two children in a community called El Sauce in Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Province of Cartago. This is a small rural community with around two thousand people. They are work producing milk and growing coffee. It has an irregular terrain and a lot of it is maintained as humid tropical forest. The community has traditional landscapes that mix with the tropical forest, with two nice lagoons, coffee plantations and milk factories. El Sauce is located about an hour and a half from Turrialba, the closest commercial center. However, several times a year, the road is closed due to the heavy rain in the area. This is without a doubt one of the main challenges of the community.\r\nWhen there was nothing to do in town, a lot of people decided to go to Turrialba for work or to banana farms in the Atlantic coast in Costa Rica. Right now, coffee and milk prices have improves, so the neighbors are looking for ways to invest their money in the area and avoid migrations.\r\nTwo years ago, he installed a cheese manufacturing company in his community for the El Sauce\u2019s Milk Producer\u2019s Association. Therefore, Guido has been focusing in the production of milk during this time, that he later on sells to this plant.\r\nThis time, Guido would like to get a \u00a2670.00 loan (six hundred and seventy colones) to purchase more cows and increase the production of milk. He knows that having more cattle will imply greater sacrifices, but he wants to support his family so he's willing to make the effort.\r\nRight now, Guido milks his cows in a small wooden facility that we turned into a milking room. He says that he\u2019s able to produce around 20 liters of milk a day and with more cows his production will reach 70 liters, so he's very excited about seeing his business grow and get stronger.\r\n\r\nLuis is a member of the El Sauce Farmers Association, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his ninth loan. He hopes to continue growing at a personal level and financial level. He also believes it\u2019s important to mention that thanks to these type of organizations he is able to devote more time to productive activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

He is 35 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Warlito owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Warlito has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 5,500 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Warlito joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Warlito is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be his third from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.

They have 1 child who is 9 years old. \r\n\r\nMielin joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mielin has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 7,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 20,000 PHP, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her business. \r\n\r\nMielin G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

While each member receives an individual loan, they are all responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Linda M.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Linda owns and operates a rice retailing business, selling to her neighbors and friends. She has been engaged in this business for ten years and earns approximately $125 a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Linda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. \r\n\r\nShe is now requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used as additional capital for her business. This will be her 4th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the living standards of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

married and has an adult daughter, Marina, who is 20 years old.  They live in Nikipol.  Yelena is involved in retail sales of children's clothing.  She always carries quality merchandise to satisfy every budget and taste, and this is why her merchandise is always in demand, and she has regular customers.  Yelena started her business 11 years ago.  At that time, she worked at a market, but then transferred her sales from the market to a store.  Now her merchandise does not get worn and dirty, and she has more space to display the clothing.  Besides, Yelena carefully selects the merchandise she buys and, thus, established herself as an experienced and diligent entrepreneur.  Yelena needs financial assistance in the form of a loan of 6,000 hryvnia to pay for her daughter's second semester of university study.  Yelena does not have such a large sum on hand, but the payment needs to be made right away and in full.  Obtained funds will help Yelena to pay for her daughter's education directly, and then she will be able to repay the loan gradually.  Being a single mother, Yelena understands that she has no one to count on and, hence, relies on the loan from Kiva.

Despite the circumstances she has had to confront, she has never given up. She has always tried to get ahead. For the past 3 years she has been raising animals and selling milk, which she gets every morning when she milks her cows. This is one of the most profitable businesses if one puts in the necessary effort. In order to do this, she needs to feed her cattle well and sell the milk nearby, walking a few blocks, with the goal of bringing home some daily earnings.

She will use the loan to buy more materials to make fish traps. In this way, she believes, she will earn more income for her family. The loan will also be used to help her get started in a new business. \r\n\r\nCEVI is reaching out to more people, especially the poor, to start and have their own business. It helps people provide a livelihood for their families. CEVI is not only giving credit but training and insurance coverage as well.

Jorge Ch\u00e1vez II communal bank, Tarapoto District, San Martin Province, San Martin Department. She is 54 years old and married, with two dependent children.\r\n\r\nWishing to see her children become professionals, and have their own money in order to achieve this, she decided to start her own business. She tells us that she has faced many difficulties in her life, but her characteristic fighting spirit and her desire to get ahead compelled her to start her business preparing and selling beverages, such as different kinds of chicha (traditional Peruvian corn drinks), as well as sodas. Elci sells these drinks in her own home, and also goes into the streets to sell them. Little by little she became well-known among her customers, who incluD. her neighbors, drivers, visitors to the city and friends. She has been well-received and her sales are going well, both in the morning and in the afternoons. \r\n\r\nWith this loan of 1,000 soles, she plans to purchase ingredients for her drinks, including 2 kilos of corn and sugar, which she buys daily. She will also purchase other ingredients to add to her drinks, including cloves, cinnamon, pineapple and ice, as well as firewood and sodas in different sizes and flavors.\r\n\r\nElci is dedicated to continuing her beverage sales, but dreams of opening a well-equipped restaurant in order to give her customers better service and attention.

Banana is a fruit, which they harvest two times a week.  They sell it from their own farm to the merchants who visit them.\r\n\r\nTo Jesusa, the farming work is not complicated.  She wants to devote herself to buying and selling bananas.  That is the way she can get greater earnings for her household.  That is the reason she carefully clears her banana fields of shrubs.

The additional income resulting from this loan will enable Benson to pay school fees for his children. In five years' time, he hopes to have expanded his dairy farming by acquiring four more dairy cows.

The group is comprised of ten members.  Each one of them works day to day at their business activities .  They do this in an area with scant resources in the city of Santo Domingo.  The group is located to the north of the city.  The members work in established businesses in their own homes and or other places or in an itinerant manner.  They mostly sell clothes, footwear, accessories, cosmetics, food, and other miscellaneous products.\r\n\r\nFrancisca\u2019s family is maD. up of her three children and their parents.  They live in a rented home, which is a simple structure maD. of wood.  This mother has been very dedicated to her work.  She does this to help her children be able to get ahead, become professions, get an education, and form their own families.  Her most difficult challenge has been always working to bring in extra income for her family.\r\n\r\nFrancisa\u2019s business is selling bacon and pork.  She prepares the meat in order to sell for a better price and to be able to save more.  She has been engaged in this business activity for two years.  She tells us that she started thanks to motivation from some friends and some money that she was able to get together with her husband.  Then she was able to apply for loans from Esperanza, and she was able to invest.  Francisca has now had three loans with Esperanza Internacional.  She is very grateful because she has been able to move forward, and she has been able to invest in her business.  She will use this new loan to buy several pounds of bacon and pork.\r\n\r\nHer story is being used to represent the other members of her group. Her story also represents Esperanza\u2019s other clients, the Haitians (most of whom have immigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti, some of them recently) as much as the Dominicans. They generally live in very poor communities.  This zone, like a lot of other zones with scarce resources in the Dominican Republic, lacks potable water and steady electricity. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":707030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy bacon and pork","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Santo Domingo Norte","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2011-02-08T15:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yocasta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leondrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":94500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":7909.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":7300.73},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7437.02},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":7575.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7717.28},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7861.35},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8008.1},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":8157.62},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":8309.89},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8465.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8623.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7134.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.42},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.01},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.68},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.43},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.09},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.24},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.42},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.68},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":815.54,"local_amount":30222.83,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":30256.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195991247},{"amount":420.37,"local_amount":15578.63,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":15595.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275319},{"amount":436.22,"local_amount":16165.72,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":16183.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206142579},{"amount":452.66,"local_amount":16774.91,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16793.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211215575},{"amount":425.21,"local_amount":15757.91,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":15775.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216493952}],"funded_date":"2011-02-09T00:00:38Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":274979,"name":"Saba Allah Ditta Masih's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saba lives in Mian Channu, a small city known for its agriculture industry in Punjab, Pakistan.

That does not apply to Ni Putu Warniasih. She is a mother of three. Two of her three children are in elementary school. That condition creates the needs to cover school tuitions in addition to the living costs. One of her obsessions is to have the children to get the highest education possible so they can transform their life to be better than their parents. Although her husband is selling vegetables door to door, Ni Putu Warniasih does not want to sit around and do nothing. Utilizing a small lot in her yard, she and her husband made a small shed with three compartments. The first compartment is to grow the piglets, the second compartment is for the sow and the third compartment is for breastfeeding. With the loan from Dinari, Ni Putu Warniasih can buy a sow that will soon deliver the piglets which will then occupy the shed. She plan on harvesting every three months. She decides to do so to get a fast turn around to allow her to use the profit for additional capital and to help cover her family's living expense. \r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nDi adat Bali kuno, seringkali muncul pemahaman bahwa wanita hanya diam dirumah untuk merawat anak dan melayani suami. Namun, hal itu tidak berlaku bagi Ni Putu Warniasih. Ni Putu Warniasih adalah ibu dengan 3 orang anak. Dua dari tiga anaknya sudah mengenyam pendidikan di bangku Sekolah dasar ( SD ). Kondisi seperti itu tentunya membutuhkan banyak biaya, baik untuk kebutuhan sehari \u2013 hari atau biaya sekolah. Satu keyakinan Ni Putu Warniasih adalah ia berkeinginan anaknya dapat menempuh pendidikan setinggi mungkin sehingga mereka akan dapat mengubah hidupnya menjadi lebih baik atau menjadi lebih baik dari orang tuanya. Walaupun suaminya berprofesi sebagi pedagang sayuran keliling, hal itu tidak membuat Ni Putu Warniasih berdiam diri saja. Dengan memanfaatkan sepetak tanah dibelakang rumahnya, Ni Putu Warniasih dengan suaminya membuat sebuah kandang dengan 3 ruangan. Ruangan pertama untuk anak babi yang digemukkan, ruang 2 untuk induk dan ruang 3 untuk induk yang menyusui. Dengan pinjaman dari Dinari, Ni Putu Warniasih membeli induk babi yang sudah dikawinkan. Perhitungannya induk babi itu akan segera melahirkan anak dan segera mengisi kandangnya. Ni Putu Warniasih berencana memelihara babi untuk babi guling yang dipanen 3 bulan sekali. Hal itu dipilihnya karena perputaran modalnya cepat, sehingga Ni Putu Warniasih bisa menyisihkan untuk modal dan kebutuhan sehari \u2013 hari.

Palm kernels are processed through various stages to obtain the oil, which is used to prepare many local dishes. She supplies her oil to food vendors. However, her production is on a small scale because of her low working capital.  The loan would allow Fati to buy more palm kernels and an electric milling machine; the machine would increase her efficiency in producing larger quantities.

Los padres de Marcial  son personas dedicadas al cultivo de todo tipo de frutas, y \u00e9l desde peque\u00f1o apoyaba a su padre en lo que le encomendara. A los 15 a\u00f1os sinti\u00f3 inclinaci\u00f3n por la carpinter\u00eda, por ello que busc\u00f3 trabajar con personas con este oficio; empez\u00f3 pasando maderas, cepillando retazos y finalmente, de a pocos, empez\u00f3 con el lijado. Desde entonces decidi\u00f3  independizarse, cultivaba sus propios productos y con las ganancias invert\u00eda en m\u00e1quinas y herramientas de carpinter\u00eda.

","en":"Marcial is 34 years old and has been living with his partner for 11 years. He is the father of 3 boys and now they live in their own house. Marcial's parents grow all types of fruit and ever since Marcial was little he has helped his father out where he can. When he was 15 he became interested in carpentry so he looked for work with people who worked in this profession. He began by passing wood, brushing pieces and finally, little by little, he began sandpapering. Since then he has decided to become independent, growing his own products and investing the profits in machines and tools for his carpentry. He has been working in this way for two months but it is still not very profitable because he still does not have all of the tools he needs so it takes a lot of time to make furniture. For this reason he also works as a driver and cares for his crops, where his wife is his greatest support. With these three businesses he is able to support his family. Despite being new to carpentry, Marcial is very happy in this job because he says making each piece of furniture takes imagination and creativity. Now he would like to buy merchandise to be able to open a warehouse that his wife would take care of and which would mean an additional income. <p>\r\nMarcial is a new client of MFP, which is why he is committed to meeting his payments in agreement with the timetable established by his credit assessor. He also has high expectations that his communal bank will work well. The money he is asking for will be divided into two parts: a certain amount will be used to buy sandpaper and nails of a variety of sizes for his carpentry work, the rest will buy merchandise to turn his dream of a warehouse in his house into a reality.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lara Francis, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":284496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy carpentry materials and merchandise for his warehouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-19T12:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcial","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1064.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640627}],"funded_date":"2009-03-19T12:41:48Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lara Francis","image":null}},{"id":97963,"name":"Kehinde","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kehinde F. is a hair stylist who also sells hair extensions and hair creams.

They ask for help from their community because currently, as was the case in the time of the Inca,  there exists the famous AYNI system (a form of communal work where neighbors help each other on their lands at sowing and harvest time).  Agustina grows potatoes and corn which she then sells.  This is how she supports herself and helps her children with their studies.  Agustina herself wasn't lucky enough to study at secondary level and she started working on her parents' land when she was a very little girl.  Today she understands that studying is very important if her children are to have a better opportunity in life.  She is requesting a loan to invest in buying corn and potatoes to sow on her lands and harvest next year.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group also farm and raise young animals.\r\n\r\nAgustina is grateful for the loan which she will receive and pledges to continue working hard to make her repayments and improve her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4475,"image":{"id":645394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To invest in buying corn and potatoes to sow on her lands and harvest next year","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chinchero - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-11-21T20:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4475,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Grimaldina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Gregorio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guido ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cleofe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eusebio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yenny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Balvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":12550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1892.31},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1968.04},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2046.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2128.58},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2213.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2300.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":674.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":701.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":729.82},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":758.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":789.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":820.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":674.75,"local_amount":1892.31,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1893.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188633151},{"amount":701.75,"local_amount":1968.04,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1969.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191375776},{"amount":729.82,"local_amount":2046.75,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:20:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2048.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195793232},{"amount":758.99,"local_amount":2128.58,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2130.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201234987},{"amount":789.34,"local_amount":2213.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2215.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206101363},{"amount":820.35,"local_amount":2300.65,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2302.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211171796}],"funded_date":"2010-11-22T12:32:26Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:36:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":254511,"name":"Mutangu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mutangu is a 44 year-old man who is married to Mbula, who is a 40 year-old housewife.

She smokes and sells fish. To smoke the fish, you go to the sea shore to buy fresh fish from the fishermen.  When you come home with the fish, you clean them. Once you drain the water from the fish, the fish will be ready to be smoked. Firewood and a traditionally-built oven are prepared to smoke the fish. The cooking time for the fish varies depending on the size of the fish and their arrangement in the oven. \r\nThe most important thing about this process is that it is the smoke, not the fire, that cooks the fish. The smoke gives the fish its dark color. Green leaves are used as coverings for the fish to prevent the smoke from escaping into the air. The heat should also be moderate as too much heat would not allow the fish to cook properly.\r\n\r\nCape Coast is a town in the Central Region of Ghana that is known to be a fishing community.

Having the need to somehow support her little children she decided to take action. With a small amount of money she had saved from the family expenses she started a business renting movies, a business that until today she still manages eventhough her husband\\'s problem is no longer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responsibility, personal strength, and integrity are the characteristics that clearly define Miss Eulalia.

He is 27 years old. He was born in a low-income family. 5 years ago he started his own business. To begin, he rented a two room facility, which he equipped with 5 computers and an Internet connection. He also provided his clients with software and sold parts for computers and cellphones. Naturally, computers become outdated as fast as technological progress marches forward and currently Siyavush is a situation where he has to either update his equipment or lose his clients. The latter would be detrimental to the well being of his family since the income from the business is used to support his parents and five siblings. This is why Siyavush come to the Norwegian Microcredit LLC (Normicro), a Kiva partner, to ask for a loan that will allow him to update the equipment in his Internet club.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from

He has been a farmer for the past 20 years, which he began with the goal of supporting his household and above all to satisfy the needs of his children.   For Primitivo, agriculture is an activity that he likes to do.  Within it, advocado production is what he likes most as it is easier to cultivate these plants and the product is profitable in season, which is annually.  But the earnings are greater and beneficial for every farmer, especially when buyers purchase the production in great quantitites and the expense of transporting the products is avoided as the buyers come to harvest and take them away themselves. However, it is difficult to grow advocado plants as well as fertilize the lands to have a favorable production.

married, he is 45 years old and has 6 children.  He has been taking care of livestock since his childhood while he helped his parents and during trading at the market he participated in bargaining with his father; he grew up and learned to raise livestock on his own and sell it at the market.  \r\n\r\nIn his free time Abduvohid works as a shepherd and goes for several days into the mountains to pasture in order to feed sheep and goats, including his own sheep.  In the yard, in the spring, the family plants a garden with vegetables in order to not to have to purchase them from the city as it is more then 60 kilometers to the city and the trip is expensive.  Abduvohid is grateful to MicroInvest and to KIVA for their support.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":274000,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" Purchase of livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-02-17T21:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abduvohid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":266.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":278.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27120725},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:05:35Z","rounded_local_amount":278.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015840},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":278.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599577},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:57:21Z","rounded_local_amount":278.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994023},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T10:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":278.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215293},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":278.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73644795}],"funded_date":"2009-02-17T22:06:30Z","paid_date":"2009-10-10T10:24:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sabina Holzman","image":36162}},{"id":93883,"name":"Khalida Parveen Ghulam Rasool Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khalida Parveen baji, a resident of Vehari, Pakistan for the past 11 years, is the wife of G.

Supporting her seven children with their studies and ambitions in life is not an easy task, says Victoria. This is why she patiently works hard and sacrifices a lot in order to provide her children with the necessities. She is glad that some of her children are already finished their college courses. Victoria still strives hard to further provide her other children with a brighter future by continuing to send them to school.\r\n\r\nThe income from their tricycle transport business is not enough to support her family\u2019s basic needs. Victoria hopes that she will able to increase her capital to improve her business. Recently, Victoria learned about ASKI. Upon learning their objectives in the community, she joined ASKI\u2019s lending program. She is asking to borrow PHP 10,000 ($225 US). She will use the money to expand their current business into a general store business. The loan will also be used to make general repairs for their tricycle transport business to make its performance in good condition, thus acquiring many customers. They will be able to earn more and start their general store business. Eventually they will have an additional source of income.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gairan, Bogo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a business selling fish. Her husband Jose Stephen U. Jr., who is 40 years old, works as a clerk to earn his living. They have three children who are 2 to 15 years old. Amelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amelita  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 4,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 800, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her second cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her fish selling business so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. Amelita U. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is 27 years old, married to Vanissa P., and currently has no children. To make a living, he is presently engaged in a pig-trading business. He\u2019s been engaged in this kind of business for 2 years. He is earning at least 2,000 PHP a month from pig sales.\r\n\r\nJust this year, Ramil joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ramil, as a newly recognized member of PMPC under the Regular Loan Program, is now requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP as his first loan, which will be used for additional capital for his existing pig buying and selling business. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family, especially in meeting their basic needs, savings for future use, loan repayments and possible business expansions.\r\n\r\n\r\n About PMPC:\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Marhabo is 30 years old. She is married with three children. Since she has lived with her husband, she has worked in the business of buying and selling cattle. She walks through the farms and several settlements to buy cattle at the lowest price to be able to increase her profits. She currently has two cows. \r\n\r\nNow Marhabo wants to expand her business and, as her children are grown up, she thinks that she will be able to look after more cattle with their help. So she is asking for 5,500 TJS in order to purchase cattle. Marhabo expresses her gratitude to everyone supporting her and promises to repay the loan on time. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Estella R., 33, lives to prove that, indeed, people deserve second chances. Estella is married to Jaime and together they raise a relatively young, big family of five children, of which one is adopted. One child is not yet of school age; two are enrolled in day care; and the other two are in elementary school.\r\n\r\nEstella's involvement in CCT* as a Community Partner enables her to run a two-year business in direct-selling. She sells products from the clothing brand MSE Apparel to friends, neighbors, and business connections. She has no commercial space yet, and thus works at home. Estella has also begun a food stall at home, where she prepares breakfast for neighbors who are in too much of a hurry to prepare one. With these businesses, she earns around 18,000 PHP monthly.\r\n\r\nMaking room for failures while achieving the best that she can, Estella is determined to make this food stall work. To help her grow her business, she applied for a 10,000 PHP loan. She will use these funds to buy can't-do-without items like plates, spoons and forks, a kettle, and most importantly, a gas stove. While preparing for this, she also plans to boost her direct selling business by purchasing more MSE products like shirts, shoes, and pants to sell.\r\n\r\nEstella admits struggling with the collection of payments from her customers. She mentions some have escaped the collection of payments. Also, she sees that there are times when her products would not sell. Nevertheless, Estella chooses to perceive these as second chances for her and for her customers to do better the next time. She aims to maintain a good savings account in CCT and grow her businesses so she will be able to make improvements on their house. Above all, she hopes that her children, young as they are, will not take chances, but will give it their best shot when it comes to their studies.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":696948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase utensils and facilities for cooking","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-01-20T17:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3336.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191396079},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2669.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814188},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3336.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256753},{"amount":15,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":667.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123446}],"funded_date":"2011-01-20T18:50:53Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":270914,"name":"Jose Andres","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 se dedica a trabajar en acarreo as\u00ed como la venta de leche agria, desde hace varios a\u00f1os, pues es su medio de subsistencia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

In this way, he will continue working and striving to achieve his great dream of having his own home."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1312014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to make improvements to his home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUARAZ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rolando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":294.01},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":275.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":290.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":297.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":312.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":320.88},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":333.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":348.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":359.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":375.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":388.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":404.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.93},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.61},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.14},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jamie Schau","image":1143325}},{"id":730505,"name":"Djromahuton Group","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe DJROMAHUTON est form\u00e9 de quatre personnes qui r\u00e9sident dans la m\u00eame localit\u00e9 et appartiennent \u00e0 une m\u00eame \u00c9glise.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Daniel\u2019s family, and the 14 other households using the local water source, need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nDaniel has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Daniel volunteered to be the promoter because he wants to help the community access safe water. There are also three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Wilikista, Chrisencia and Maureen.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

She has four daughters and one son. Her eldest two daughters live in the countryside and work as herders. Her son lives and studies in the city of Erdenet. She lives with her husband and two youngest daughters in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.\r\n<p>\r\nTogether with her husband, she started a business in 2000, running a fruit stall at the Narantuul (\"black market\"), the biggest year-round outdoor market in Mongolia. She sells fruit at all times except winter. During the winter months, she sells frozen fruits, such as cranberries, and many types of jellies.

Farukh is 36 years old. He is married with three children. Farukh has already run his business for seven years. He sells household appliances and different cosmetics for women.

Having loans from IMON since 2006, Farukh had shown himself as a reliable client with a positive credit history.   \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Thanks to this loan, she will be able to grow her business further and help feed her family.  <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Marciano has been engaged in his business for over 6 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Marciano joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marciano has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. Marciano is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Marciano from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Now she has a business location and she works from 6:00am to 9:00pm.\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to increase her business she wants to buy rice, sugar and oil with her loan. In the future, she wants to give her children the store so they can manage it. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lauren Jackson, Kiva

Crispina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Crispina is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Crispina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Valerie is a 44 year old woman, born in Gasabo, in the province of the city of Kigali, the capital of Rwanda.  She is married and has four children between the ages of 10 and 18 years old, all in school.  Valerie and her family live in Kinyinya- Gasabo- Kigali.  She has a primary school education.  She is paid by the Pentecote (Adepr) Church, Parish of Gasave, where she is a church evangelist.  The loan she got from ACB is her fifth.  The previous one helped her to improve her family's living conditions and her present loan is to renovate her house.  Her savings allows her to pay the rent for where she lives with her family until they have the house, which she wants to renovate or finish.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Aside from this she also earn extra income from a direct sales business like AVON.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every day\r\n\r\nTo help her expand her business, she is requesting a Php 21,000 loan to buy additional grocery items, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. The loan will also ensure extra capital for her direct selling business, and she can offer more AVON products to her old and new customers. This will bring forth added income for the family and will improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nTeresita dreams of expanding her business, possibly to a mini-grocery store. In this way she can give her children a good future and help them attain their dreams. She does not only hope for material things for her children, but most importantly she wants them to serve God and get involved in church ministry. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share her hopes and aspirations regarding her family.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

They face an obstacle because they do not have enough money to buy fertilizer to support their field. To deal with this problem, Mrs. Sann C. is asking for a loan to buy fertilizer for the fields, and she would use the rest of loan to purchase fuel to water the field to make her crops more productive. She is the mother of three children who are employed in a garment factory.\r\n\r\nOne member in this group has a loan that is end-of-term, and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

She is 29 years old and lives with her husband Dante, who is also 29 years old, and her four-year-old son Johan.  Living together in their own house in a quiet village in the mountains of Peru, they are very proud of all they have accomplished so far.\r\n\r\nEvery day is a constant struggle to make progress. Brisayda has to work seven days a week, from early morning until nightfall, but she finds the strength for this as she is very energetic. She runs a business selling groceries in the shop she has owned for four years in her own home. There she sells the wide variety of products that are sought after by her regular customers, who she serves in a friendly manner, as this business generates a good income.\r\n\r\nBrisayda knows that her efforts are rewarded and so she works day after day, with almost no time to rest. She gets up very early to look after her little ones, get them ready for school and then start work. Sometimes life shows us just how much a mother is capable of doing for the wellbeing of her children. Without tiring, nothing stops Brisayda - she is indefatigable.\r\n\r\nThis is the seventh loan Brisayda has had from Kiva Field Partner, Microfinanzas Prisma (MFP). There is no doubt about her responsibility, and furthermore she does not want to let down her community bank, which includes other enterprising women.

It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
