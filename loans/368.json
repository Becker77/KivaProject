The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For several years now, she has been planting and cultivating potatoes and peas. On the advice of her neighbors, she has also started planting flowers, which has been very profitable for her, especially during the months of May and October. If she doesn't get the chance to cut all of the flowers, she allows them to continue growing on her land until they begin to produce seeds, which she then sells or plants in the next season. Maria has decided to make planting flowers her top priority, since they don't incur any losses, though they do require extensive watering, and she has to water them day and night in order to make the plants produce flowers quickly. She plans to continue to grow flowers, but also wants to start raising and selling cows in the meantime, as she waits for the harvest months. This is her eighth credit with Microfinanzas Prisma, and despite her difficult economic situation, what stands out in Maria is her ability to responsibly make her loan payments. She also attends all of her village bank meetings, and since she doesn't have very good hearing, she asks for her fellow group members' support when necessary.

He was given a loan to buy a dynamo and to line an artesian well because his area has a critical shortage of water.  He must do this work during the day because his watchman duties are at night.  Prior to this employment, he made bricks as an employee of another person.\r\n\r\nHe hopes that the digging of the well will end his problems with water supply because the well is well-fed and it does not dry up in Summer.  German is married and has three, school-age children.  He hopes that they will become prepared in the future and that he will see the fruits of his labor in his children.  His parents don't live with him because he started his own family but he helps them out whenever he can.\r\n\r\nThis is his 4th loan with Ceprodel and has collaborated with the institution since 2006.  He stated that Ceprodel loans have been very useful in improving his living conditions because he has been able to improve his home and buy things needed in his home.  He is, therefore, hopeful to continue working with and not disappointing Ceprodel.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. \r\n\r\nMaribel is now borrowing PHP 21,000 so that she can buy more stock for her general store.  This will be her 8th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Maribel aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

After making soap from used cottonseed oil and soda ash, she sells them retail to a clientele of mostly local women.\r\nWith this loan, she hopes to earn a monthly income of 275 000 XOF, which will be used mainly to grow her business capital, contribute to family expenses, and pay the interest on her loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":941270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase used cottonseed oil and soda ash ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T03:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:50Z","rounded_local_amount":50488.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283270},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":50488.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424781},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50488.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140046},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50488.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757020},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":50488.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251778},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":50488.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410784},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":50488.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294448956},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50488.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502724},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":50488.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268402},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50488.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498819}],"funded_date":"2011-12-14T17:27:52Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T15:33:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tamara Kislak","image":897432}},{"id":373039,"name":"Elvie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvie is 31 years old and lives in Sapang Ama, Sapang Dalaga Dalaga.

She studies technical nursing at the Trujillo Institute.  She did not receive a title and later the institute disappeared.  Later she traveled to the mountains to work in first aid, then came to Trujillo to care for her 15 year old daughter. She lives in the El Porvenir District in the Trujillo Province in the La Libertad Department (like a state).  In order to support herself economically she began selling prepared foods, like fried Rellenas (peppers), and cosmetic products.  At the same time she worked in Trujillo, but left the job because she did not have enough time to take care of her daughter.   She has worked with the Manuela Ramos Movement for three years.  Her aunt recommended the community bank, \"Hope of the Morning,\" and she decided to become a member because it was another support for her.

Khalik is a teacher of school by profession, but he earns very little so he also runs a business of raising and selling cattle. He has 11 years of experience in this field. Since cattle raising and selling is a profitable business, Khalik has become a very successful businessman. Khalik has a friendly family who always try to help each other. Thus, his wife and daughter help him with the cattle raising business. He works very hard and spends his weekend time with the cattle, cleaning, feeding and pasturing them. Now Khalik wants to expand his business and buy more cattle, so he applied for a loan. He promises to repay the loan on time and thanks all lenders for their support. With your help, Khalik can get ahead.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The money that she is requesting will be used to buy more clothing and thus increase her business.\r\n.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":423390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-10T00:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":222.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":223.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":232.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":244.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":256.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":260.87},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":276.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":283.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.85},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.46},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.9},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.65},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.85,"local_amount":222.44,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:14Z","rounded_local_amount":227.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843178},{"amount":156.08,"local_amount":445.94,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:52Z","rounded_local_amount":456.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734765},{"amount":3.61,"local_amount":10.31,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":10.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124119},{"amount":85.46,"local_amount":244.17,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":249.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959830},{"amount":89.9,"local_amount":256.86,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":262.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992675},{"amount":91.31,"local_amount":260.87,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":267.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717458},{"amount":96.65,"local_amount":276.16,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":282.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751198},{"amount":99.14,"local_amount":283.25,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":289.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933751}],"funded_date":"2009-11-10T04:59:13Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":155171,"name":"Kisa Kya Mukama Group, Mityana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"B.

Over the years, his business has been quite successful, and he has proven himself to be a trustworthy borrower.  Galbaatar is focused on the future; in particular, he hopes to generate additional income so that he can pay for his children's tuition.

She is 30 years old. Maricel is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Tundan 1.\r\n\r\nMaricel is married and has 4 adult-aged children. To make a living, Maricel owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fruit products like watermelon, mangoes, bananas, rambutan, etc. in the local community. Maricel has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maricel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maricel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Maricel is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Maricel from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Since old times, Kyrgyz  families tended to have six or seven children. The reason for that is the strong family ties and sense of family identity of a Kyrgyz family.  And, they simply just love children. Urban families now usually stop at a third or fourth child, but rural families still follow the old Kyrgyz culture and like having big and friendly families. \r\n\r\n\r\nGulnara I. is the treasurer of this group.  She is a forty-seven-year-old resident of Kochkor, a small town in northern Kyrgyzstan.  She has a big asset:  six children. The youngest child is now a senior in high school. Gulnara proudly claims that raising six children was her greatest accomplishment. She feels fulfilled in helping them find their own place in life. \r\n\r\nGulnara and her husband are skilled farmers. They say land is always the only source of income and they cannot imagine life without farming, because it\u2019s what they have been doing their entire lives. Along with farming, the family raises and sells cattle. The family started the business fifteen years ago with only 10,000 soms. Now they have 10,000 in monthly profit.   But because of inflation, this amount is not enough to purchase additional cattle and to advance the business. Gulnara hopes to get a loan in order to promote her business. Time will show if she will be able to build the house of her dreams. \r\n\r\n\r\n  --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

This is not the first time that she has taken out loans for her business.  She has been in her business, selling meat, for more than 8 years.  She started her business because she needed to put food on the table for her family as she didn't have much support from her family members.  In spite of the difficulties that she faced, she has managed to get ahead in her business.  This loan will be used to buy a large variety of meat since she has a lot of demand from her customers during the festive season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":681944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maudiel Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":916.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.31,"local_amount":928.31,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":969.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191425782},{"amount":44.26,"local_amount":927.39,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":968.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195844695},{"amount":44.21,"local_amount":926.21,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:06:47Z","rounded_local_amount":967,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201286819},{"amount":44.22,"local_amount":926.47,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":967.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206154881},{"amount":44.17,"local_amount":925.46,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":966.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211227750},{"amount":43.37,"local_amount":908.77,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:06:44Z","rounded_local_amount":948.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216506525},{"amount":44.3,"local_amount":928.09,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":968.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221670593},{"amount":44.43,"local_amount":930.85,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":971.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227039307},{"amount":43.55,"local_amount":912.4,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-18T07:58:22Z","rounded_local_amount":952.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233214298},{"amount":128.18,"local_amount":2686.05,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-18T09:30:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2804.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239090073}],"funded_date":"2011-01-05T22:21:53Z","paid_date":"2011-11-18T09:30:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":266476,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is a member of Kibera Upendo group in Faulu Kenya.

is 54 years old, married and supports her family by operating three business ventures: a ticketing outlet, an internet caf\u00e9 and broadcasting. She lives in Escalante, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 30,000. Helen is borrowing PHP 29,500 to fund operations. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Helen aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She was able to start this business when she became a member of ASHI in 2004. Cristina took the risk of taking out a loan then and started taking a step toward achieving her dream of a better life for her family. The endeavor she chose was supported by her loving husband. Despite poverty, Cristina now is happier than before because she has her own business and is playing a productive role as a wife and mother. However, growing her \u201csari-sari\u201d store into a grocery store that has a complete inventory of goods which people can access without spending money for going to the market would make her complete. Her dream of a better life for her family is anchored to this goal; thus, it needs to be achieved. \r\n\r\nCristina is hopeful that through ASHI, a Kiva field partner in the Philippines, she will be able to have a larger amount of capital to materialize her dream for her business and family.

O. is a married man and has one child aged one, to whom he hopes to give a good education to university level. Dennis' business is located at the busy Nyalenda market in Kisumu. Kisumu is the region in Kenya that harbors Lake Victoria and is commonly referred to as the lake basin. \r\n<br>Dennis runs a general store in which he sells such items such as beverages, sugar, detergents, flour, cooking oil and so forth to local people. He has been doing this business for two years now. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is that there are other people in the area doing the same business so his customers are not always loyal as they are spoiled for choice. However, Dennis works very hard to keep his business doing well.

She lives in the town of Malambo with her husband and 9 year old son. She has a variety store in her house, where she sells women's accessories, paper products, beauty items and other merchandise, according to the season. Her enterprising experience began 15 years ago, when, using her creativity, she started her business. She made artisanal crafts with her own hands, taking advantage of the fact that her spouse worked in a store. He made commercial contacts in the small communities nearby and built their own clientele. Finally, less than 2 years ago, when her husband stopped working in the store, they invested his severance package in a variety store. They mixed their own products and various merchandise. They started selling via orders and later sold according to each season. \r\n\r\nDilsa's creativity knows no limits, nor does her desire to learn. Besides making products out of materials such as leather, she also learned to make sandals, which she displays in her store with much pride. Her business is growing gradually, because her clientele has expanded. This is the reason why she has turned to a Kiva loan, the first loan she has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy toys, taking advantage of the Christmas season. Usually she has a lot of orders from her customers, especially for toys, given to children for the birth of the Christ child. They receive them with much joy and they play in the streets of town. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":939881,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy toys","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-10T14:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":75798},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80063},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":81931},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83843},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85799},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87801},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89850},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91946},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94092},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96287},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":98534},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":104056}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.03},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.03},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.95},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.73,"local_amount":75798,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:02Z","rounded_local_amount":78491.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188777},{"amount":43.03,"local_amount":80063,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":82908.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324982},{"amount":44.03,"local_amount":81931,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":84842.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039043},{"amount":45.05,"local_amount":83843,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":86822.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651188},{"amount":46.11,"local_amount":85799,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":88848.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140794},{"amount":47.18,"local_amount":87801,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":90921.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100697},{"amount":48.28,"local_amount":89850,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":93043.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338317},{"amount":260.59,"local_amount":484915,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":502147.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356498066}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T16:02:43Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:43:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":373071,"name":"Lourdesita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lourdesita is married and has five children.

They live in Ticuantepe, an agricultural area with a high potential for eco tourism. For the last 30 years, she and her husband have dedicated themselves to growing the most predominant crop in the area, pineapple, as well as, bananas, oranges, lemons and mandarins (citrus). The municipality has excellent farming conditions because of the climate and arable land, both favourable for agriculture. This is how these parents prepared their children, who are university students preparing themselves for a better life.\r\n\r\n<p>She explains that the production process of different crops includes chemical control of bushes, as the crops need to be free of them to develop properly; to this end, 3 cycles of chemical control -- herbicides and man power -- are needed during this process. Unfortunately, this process is expensive and Darling can't afford it at the moment.  She needs a loan to cover the costs, as the success of her crops depend on it. <b><p>Translated by Beatriz Yuste, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><b>\r\n\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Darling aprendi\u00f3 de su esposo el oficio de la agricultura, quien desde muy joven ha trabajado en el campo, habitan en Ticuantepe una zona altamente productiva con un alto potencial para el ecoturismo.

Es de esta manera como estos padres han preparado a sus 2 hijos quienes se encuentran estudiando en la universidad, prepar\u00e1ndose para un mejor futuro.\r\n\r\n<p>La se\u00f1ora explica que el proceso productivo de los diferentes cultivos requieren de un control qu\u00edmico para la  malezas de las plantaciones durante el desarrollo vegetativo, ya que requieren estar libre de malezas; para ello se debe realizar por lo menos tres controles qu\u00edmicos a lo largo de todo el proceso, a base de herbicidas combinadas con controles manuales y esto tiene un alto costo que ella no puede

With the readily available animal feed in her house and her experiences in raising livestock, the project was very successful. The subsequent loans were also used to invest in rearing pigs. Now, Mrs. Tam's family has a pig sty up to standard with about 20 pigs. Beside raising livestock, Mrs. Tam also sells vegetables in the market everyday. This also brings about a stable income for her family. Mrs. Tam has a daughter who is working with a stable monthly income of 2,000,000VND (about 125USD) so every month, Mrs. Tam receives financial support from her daughter. Wishing to improve her family's standard of living, Mrs. Tam would like to borrow 15,000,000VND (900USD) to invest in raising livestock.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Yen Thanh

","en":"Dilfuza is a young woman of 31.  She is married and the mother of two children.  She has a grocery store named Nigina in downtown Kairakkum.  Her husband handles the delivery of groceries to stock the store. He purchases goods from Khujand's Panchshanbe market, because products are cheaper there.  He has a passenger car that he uses to make the deliveries to the store.  Dilfuza began by selling small items on the street. Using credit, she expanded her business, and now she has a small store of her own.   With her next loans she wants to increase the variety of goods as the demand for other products is great. Dilfuza is grateful to the finance institution for its assistance in developing her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva

This helps them to save some money as well as make sure they have enough food for several months.\r\n<p>\r\nIvan started this business 19 years ago. He has many repeat clients who buy from him.

She is 33 years old. Roselyn is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRoselyn is married and has 1 school-aged child. To make a living, Roselyn owns & operates a specialized retail store primarily selling daily use products such as shampoo, candies, biscuits, noodles, coffee, sugar, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Roselyn has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Roselyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Roselyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Roselyn is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Roselyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

He is married and has seven children. They live together in their own home located in the town of Rosario, in the Ayacucho district. For Juan, his work has always been tied to agricultural activity, and he has been expanding in this activity for approximately 50 years. He cultivates cacao, coffee, and citrus fruits. During the growing and harvest seasons, he needs workers to complete these tasks with less time and cost, but usually he is at his farm caring for his crops in the face of any plague of insects that might affect his products. Normally he sells his products in the Collection Centers of his community, but he sells his fruit in the city of Ayacucho.

She is requesting a loan to buy supplies, such as silk thread of various colors, and to buy fish. \r\n\r\nTomasa's dreams are to acquire a market stall in Lolotique to sell her fish, to improve her sales, and to improve her family's quality of life. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":573220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buying supplies to make hammocks, such as silk thread in various colors, and buying fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Lolotiquillo, Morazan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomasa Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":13.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":14.28},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":14.93},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15.07},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":16.03},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":16.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":16.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":17.63},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":17.59},{"due_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18.79},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":19.1},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":19.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.28},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.93},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.07},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.03},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.63},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.59},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.79},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.1},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23.84,"local_amount":23.84,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":23.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166894924},{"amount":25.67,"local_amount":25.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":25.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172162942},{"amount":15.46,"local_amount":15.46,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":15.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177458822},{"amount":15.96,"local_amount":15.96,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":15.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182596868},{"amount":16.8,"local_amount":16.8,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T10:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":16.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189181603},{"amount":16.64,"local_amount":16.64,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":16.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191474439},{"amount":17.68,"local_amount":17.68,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":17.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195900235},{"amount":17.96,"local_amount":17.96,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:48:34Z","rounded_local_amount":17.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201339604},{"amount":18.9,"local_amount":18.9,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":18.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206209623},{"amount":31.09,"local_amount":31.09,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":31.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216565055}],"funded_date":"2010-08-01T15:01:08Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:42:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":221431,"name":"Nghi\u00eam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"H.

Uguloy is 40 years old, married and has four children. With her husband, she runs a business buying and selling cows. She would like to secure a loan of $900 for nine months in order to buy additional cows to increase her inventory and meet customer demand. She believes this will lead to greater revenue and, ultimately, greater profit for her family. In the future, she would like to reinvest the earnings generated by this loan back into her business to purchase even more cows and increase her income even further.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. Civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Na Some is a villager in Chan Teab village in Takeo province. She is a farmer who owns a small piece of land to cultivate rice to earn for living. Aside from this, she is a breeder who raises cow and pigs. Since breeding business is going well, she wants to expand it so she decided to ask for a loan to buy one more cow and four piglets and she would use the rest of the loan to buy pig food to support her pig.

was born in 1976 and is married with three children aged between 3 and 15 years. She and her family live in the Western Province of Rwanda, approximately three hours drive from Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda.\r\n\r\nDancille\u2019s village, called Nyabihu, is where, since 2007, she has owned her business selling women\u2019s clothes. The hours of her business are from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day except Sunday.\r\n\r\nAlthough this hardworking businesswoman has been in her business for three years, her profit is still too low to expand the business meaningfully and she believes that a small amount of additional capital would change her business positively.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, Dancille is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders via Vision Finance Company in order to purchase more clothes to sell so that she will be able to satisfy the demands of her customers.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Dancille hopes that she will become more efficient, effective and successful. She thanks VFC and Kiva lenders for their support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":477780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more clothes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Gisenyi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-01-27T00:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dancille","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:50:19Z","rounded_local_amount":130332.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118169451},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:45Z","rounded_local_amount":26066.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022772},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":39099.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152781838},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":39099.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709718},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T09:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":39099.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167037082},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":39099.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172308808}],"funded_date":"2010-01-27T01:42:05Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T09:44:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":175966,"name":"Ihab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ihab is a 20-year-old single man who has been working as a car repairman for the past eight years after stopping his education.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ihab opened his own car repair shop to earn income to help satisfy his life needs and to support his family.

She lives in Prk. San Juan, Brgy. Patao, Bantayan, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing materials business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000. Galicana is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she could fund her business operations. This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Galicana aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. In the photo, you will see her husband helping her run the business. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The women live in a small community which is located on a road, opposite a fishing dam.  The community is called Concepci\u00f3n Chico.  It is locally known as 'La Concha' (The Shell).  This is why the group, which is made up entirely of women, decided to give themselves the name 'Las Conchitas' (The Little Shells).\r\n\r\nSeveral of this group's members will invest their loan money in commercial activities: Francisca (a small store), Maria (a corn mill), Valentina (a store) and Maricela (selling shoes through a catalog).  The rest of the ladies, Maria Eleuteria, Maria Irene, Maria Modesta, Rosa Felipa and Maria Guadalupe, will invest their loan money in buying corn mills since milling corn is an activity which is very much in demand.  Everybody grows corn and, in order to give it to their animals as feed, they need to mill it.  There aren't mills to do this.\r\n\r\nThis group's representative is called Ana Luisa.  She raises chickens to sell and she tells us the following about her business: \"My business is raising chickens and sometimes turkeys.  I would like to invest in buying chickens and also build a chicken coop so that they have somewhere to sleep and protect themselves from the weather.  One problem that I have had with my animals is that, because I don't have anywhere to keep them, they disappear and then I can't find them and I lose them.  I also have to vaccinate them so that they don't get flu.  This loan will be very helpful to me because I have a son who is in elementary school and I will be able to help him by paying for some of the stationery supplies that he needs.  My goal is to build my own home because I live with my partner in my mom's house.  I am not married but I have a common-law marriage.  My partner is a construction worker.  First I would like to save up and buy a plot of land and then build.  My business is important because it means I can start to earn, even if it's just a little bit of money, and start saving\".\r\n\r\nNote: Maria C.

Dengan kredit yang diperoleh, ia manfaatkan untuk pembelian 2 ekor Induk  dan pakan ternak. Selama 6 bulan masa pemeliharaan Induk Babi ini akan melahirkan rata-rata 8 ekor. Sehingga dengan demiki selama 6 bulan pemeliharaan Ni Nyoman Wati menghasilkan 16 ekor anak babi yang bisa dijual dengan harga Rp. 250.000.- per ekor. Dari hasil penjualan keuntungan yang akan diperolah sebanyak Rp.1.000.000.- per bulan. Keuntungan itu ia manfatkan untuk memenuhi kebutuhan hidup keluarganya.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has six school-aged children.  Faasao owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting bananas for sale.  Faasao has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 350 tala WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Faasao joined Kiva partner SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Faasao's request for a loan of 1000 tala WST, which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment, is her first loan request.  Faasao plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
