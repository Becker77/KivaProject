She separated from the man who was her husband many years ago. She has two daughters, 20 and 16, who are students and who are the reason she is working: to give them a good education. They live together in their own house where they also share their days with their cousins. \r\n\r\nMaria\u2019s work involves the sale of beauty products. She sells items like personal care and facial care products, colognes, perfumes, clothing and more and she does her work from her home. When she started this work approximately 6 years ago, it was complicated for her to do since she did not know the business very well. However, with time she was able to get ahead and become a successful saleswoman. What she enjoys about her work is having time to do all the things she wants to do, as well as care for her daughters who are students and are at an age when they need so many things. Things are going well since she has two incomes, one from the sale of cosmetics and the other as a health worker in a hospital in her city.\r\n\r\nMaria has many plans for the future but what she wants to do now is to continue expanding her merchandise. This will be her second loan with MFP. She is very pleased to know that she will have financial support for in this way she will feel more certain of advancing in her work. As well, she promises once again to meet her payments on time, as she has on earlier loans. With the sum requested, 1000 soles, she will purchase beauty products to have in stock so that she will be able to offer a greater variety of goods to her customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":954161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-22T00:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":151.02},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":159.36},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":171.22},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":177.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":182.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.76},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.63,"local_amount":151.02,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":152.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836365},{"amount":59.76,"local_amount":159.36,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":161.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246150},{"amount":59.53,"local_amount":158.75,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":160.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386166},{"amount":130.81,"local_amount":348.82,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":352.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713407},{"amount":68.27,"local_amount":182.05,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":184.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202295}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T13:25:06Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":377604,"name":"Helene","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"\nCliente de 62 ans, elle est veuve et a 7 enfants plus et grand m\u00e8re de 5 petits enfants ,A la mort de son mari pour subvenir aux besoins de des enfants ,elle se lance dans la vente des vivres frais au marche.\n\nQuand elle commence a Hope, elle vendait ses vivres frais sur un \u00e9talage,et depuis qu'elle a b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de pr\u00eats de Hope, son activite a grandi, elle ne vend plus sur les \u00e9talages, a l'heure actuelle elle loue une chambre froide et elle achete en gros.\nLes differents pr\u00eats ont fait eu de l'impact dans sa vie sociale et \u00e9conomique et familiale ,elle \u00e9pargne constamment et fait ses remboursements sans difficult\u00e9s et avec ses benefices elle prend soin de sa famille et elle assure la scolarit\u00e9 de ses petits enfants.\n\nElle a pour ambition de continuer d'aller vers l'avant et \u00eatre une grossiste renomm\u00e9e des vivres frais.   \n\n  ","en":"Helene is a 62 year old client.

She has been very productive in the businesses she has started. Her former husband cares for two of her five children, and three of the children are in her care. \r\n<p>\r\nThis, her latest venture, is a general convenience store. She says that most of her sales are derived from the sale of rum and beer, together with rice. I mentioned that this was the same combination of goods that other merchants were requesting a loan for to sell in the same community. I asked why many women would be stocking the same products to increase sales capability, as opposed to having a different strategy. Balbina mentioned that there are quite a few general stores in the area, but that they all have good businesses.  Each and everyone has their customer base already built up, and are sufficiently patronized to bring in a reasonable level of business activity.

Now Mrs.S. requests the loan of 1700 STJ to expand her assortment (she also wants to purchase layettes because it is one of the high-turnover products)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":118215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To increase her  assortment of goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Nau","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.266667 72.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2008-01-27T15:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-11T22:00:18Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":283.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":84,"local_amount":285.6,"processed_date":"2008-02-28T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":291.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":143723},{"amount":84,"local_amount":285.6,"processed_date":"2008-03-28T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":291.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167829},{"amount":84,"local_amount":285.6,"processed_date":"2008-04-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":291.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":193710},{"amount":84,"local_amount":285.6,"processed_date":"2008-05-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":291.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221650},{"amount":84,"local_amount":285.6,"processed_date":"2008-06-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":291.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250831},{"amount":80,"local_amount":272,"processed_date":"2008-07-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":277.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":279508}],"funded_date":"2008-01-28T22:00:18Z","paid_date":"2008-07-28T09:03:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":36644,"name":"Yawa","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Yawa G. is 33 years old, single, and the mother of two children.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":403961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase shop items in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-10-12T04:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frida  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":71120.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868361},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":71120.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757557},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":71120.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146651},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":71120.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984796},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":71120.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015469},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":71120.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740475}],"funded_date":"2009-10-18T01:11:13Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":147366,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is 61 years old and a widow with four children.

Magielyn repaid her previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. Magielyn is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand product offerings. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Magielyn from ASKI.

Despite prevailing animal diseases, she finds dairy farming to be the most enjoyable commercial farming activity. Besides dairy farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. In African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive, hobby for women. You really don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden. Any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth is doing her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful. Esther, however, is taking this a little step further. Esther is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming. This is a big deal for her. She is very excited to start growing different varieties of crops for commercial purposes.

They are currently living in her mother-in-law\u2019s house. Since she began living at her mother-in-law\u2019s home she dedicates herself to taking her cows to pasture, but there are also days that she works on the small farm with her husband, on those days she wakes up early to cook lunch and takes it into the fields. On her way she also takes the animals and ties them to places where there is a lot of pasture for them to eat. Miriam and her husband have taken this opportunity to plant peas on rented small plots of land that charge them for each cultivated crop. The good thing is that they are plots of land with good road access, and when she walks from her home to the fields she can do it in only half an hour. She is happy with her work, be it working on the small farm or putting the animals to pasture, the only difficulty is that it when it rains a great deal because she carries her baby on her back she has to cover him very well, given that once he got wet and caught a cold. As such when it rains hard she gets a hold of him and returns home. This is the 4th loan that Miriam has with the MFP bank, and in all this time she has attended all the meetings that the loan adviser carries out. Especially when it comes to payments, she always makes them on the assigned days and has never had a delinquent payment. Miriam will invest the loan requested in the purchase of 3 sacks of pea seeds, which she will plant this season with the hope of having a good crop yield in the month of May.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":261604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of pea seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-26T23:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1353.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210859}],"funded_date":"2009-01-27T00:07:01Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariela Cede\u00f1o","image":883126}},{"id":89931,"name":"Abiba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abiba I. is sixty five years old.

She was born in Camarines Sur, Bicol, a province down south of Luzon. Today, she lives with her husband and family in Pasay, Metro Manila. Blessed with five children, she and her husband Rolando are teaming up to expand their business for their family. Arlene has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than two years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow seven times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. The reason why she was consistent in paying her loans was because she used almost all of the money she borrowed to buy assorted vegetables for her business.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 48,000 loan. This amount will be used to expand her business with additional assorted vegetables, meat, and fish.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that when the time comes, they can have the resources to buy a lot or a market space where they can put up their own vegetable\/meat store.  \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":453502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Her group is located in the rural areas surrounding El-Seibo, a rural town where the economy is dominated by agriculture and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long term partner and their two children.\r\n\r\nMaritza is excited to be taking her third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans and grown her business.

Cusco is a city that is known for its archaeological sites, its historic city center, its scenery and its history; it is an enchanting city in the southern region of the country.\r\n\r\nThe members are involved in a variety of commercial activities.  Among these are: sale of food, prepared meals, crafts, jora (alcoholic beverage maD. from fermented corn), pasturage, vegetables, small farm animals, dairy products, grains; others care for senior citizens, work as hotel housekeepers and as secretaries.\r\n\r\nThe communal bank has undergone several cycles and, as the members state, they are happy and satisfied with the credit services, the savings, and the training.  They especially appreciate the accrued value that they can obtain by leaving their funds in a common account.\r\n\r\nIsabel is a member of the \u201cSe\u00f1or D. los Milagros D. Chimpahuaylla\u201d communal bank.  She lives with her life partner and has 6 children.  Isabel is a hard-working, enterprising woman who devised a way to open her own business: she sells chicha (chicha D. jora is an ancestral Peruvian and American beverage maD. from jora, fermented corn).  She has her own store, called Picanter\u00eda, located in Cusco\u2019s San Jer\u00f3nimo neighborhood\u2019s main square.  Picanter\u00eda is unique among the other businesses because a red flag is tied to a plant at the entrance. \r\n\r\nIsabel tells us how she does her work: she rises very early to prepare the chicha D. jora and then begins her sales around noon.  Starting at three in the afternoon, she provides a free snack, called \u201cpicante\u201d to her customers.  She is open for business until 10pm.  When she completes her work day, she goes home to rest in order to start all over the next day.  She has been in this line of work for 16 years and has done well thanks to the efforts she puts into her work. \r\n\r\nShe needs funding to buy firewood, jora and beer.\r\n\r\nThe group members, as a whole, are grateful for the opportunity offered and pledge to repay in a timely fashion.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":503602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"      To buy firewood, jora (alcoholic beverage made from fermented corn) and beer.

businesswoman. The challenges she went through have not stopped her from improving her family's lifestyle and giving her four children a better future. Though her husband is in prison, she has not surrendered to life and accepted poverty. Instead she has gone beyond the very few opportunities offered by her poor life and there she found ASHI. \r\n\r\nIt was in the year 2000 when Erlinda first received a loan through ASHI. She started a small \u201csari-sari\u201d (convenience) store selling a small inventory of grocery items, foodstuffs, and beverages. As the years went on, the amounts of her loans have increased and helped her sustain and expand her business. The profits she occasionally makes from her business are such a great help for her to support the needs of her children, whose ages range from 10 to 18. She also supports the needs of her husband in prison. \r\n\r\nErlinda is happy for having achieved her business. However, she still needs to have other sources of income for a back up in case her store has problems and her family needs a larger amount of financial assistance, especially for the children's education. Erlinda is requesting a larger amount to borrow to enable her to finance a transportation service which will be managed by a hired driver.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has 5 children. Her two oldest children live in Swaziland with their father and are attending university and the three smaller children live with her and go to school in Boane. Teresa studied until 5th grade and stopped due to her family\u2019s difficult financial situation. She moved with her family to Boane, a village 30Km away from the capital city Maputo, a long time ago. Teresa has had a small stand in front of her house since 1983, at which she sells ice creams, soft drinks and basic needs products. \r\n<p>\r\nAs her stand's business is quite unstable, she decided to start rearing chickens 3 years ago and has been successful so far. Teresa built a quite large henhouse in her backyard, where she now raises 1,000 chicks at a time. She buys the chicks and chicken feed in Maputo and pays someone to bring them to her house. After a 30-day maturity period Teresa sells each chicken for MTn 85. Clients normally go to her henhouse directly to buy chickens, but she sometimes transports them to the village center as well. Teresa counts on the help of her older daughter to run the stand, and they make between MTn 500 to MTn 1,000 per day. Teresa\u2019s husband is a policeman and also helps with the house\u2019s expenses and with the children\u2019s school fees.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Teresa\u2019s first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. She will use the MTn 20,000 to buy chickens, chicken feed and vaccines in large quantity to stock. She heard about Hluvuku and decided to ask for this loan, as she wants to improve her business. In future Teresa would like to build a new general store to sell food and other products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":161525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy

T. is a 53-year old widow. She was born in a family of farmers and from early childhood had to help her parents in farming.   Mamlekat got married at the age of 20 and gave a birth to two sons. She moved to her husband\u2019s home in Stepnoe village, where they lived with his elderly parents. Her husband worked on a  large state farm where Mamlekat got a job of dairymaid. He helped her in all her activities.  Later, they were able to buy a small house in Kara-Balta town (near the village). This couple worked hard to support their children. But in 1987, Mamlekat lost her support when an incurable disease caused her husband death. \r\n\r\nShe became the only breadwinner for her family. Mamlekat, being courageous woman, remained firm in her wish to provide a good future for her children. Her salary didn\u2019t cover all her family\u2019s expenses, so she decided to start her own business.  In 1999, Mamlekat sold her house in the town and bought a dairy yard near her Stepnoe village. At that time, Mamlekat  had only several calves, later her livestock grew and she got milk cows.  Mamlekat\u2019s family had revenues from selling their dairy products.  Today, Mamlekat has ten milk cows and ten bull-calves. Now Mamlekat requests a loan of 60,000 Kyrgyz Soms  to enlarge  the number of cows. It will allow her to further develop her business.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, Mamlekat\u2019s elder son married and moved out. Using the revenues, Mamlekat plans to help her younger son, who lives with her, to buy a house in Kara-Balta town. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

about the Future). All of the people in this group are trying to increase their small businesses and improve their lives. Sonia is the group representative. She is an extremely hard-working woman, with three children. She is a single mother. She is dedicated to her work because it enables her to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a small nail salon where she does artificial nails, manicures, and pedicures. Sonia is requesting her third loan, which she believes will really increase her income. She wants to reinvest almost all of her profits so that she can turn her small nail salon into a larger beauty salon. She dreams of having her own house and sending her children to college.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with Esperanza as she was learning how to work with artificial nails and how to paint artistic designs on them. She needed capital to start her business. Her story is representative of her group and, generally, of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti). Her group is located in Samana, a lush rugged peninsula with a growing tourism industry. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.

When she first joined the TYM Fund, she borrowed 200 USD and invest in breeding pigs and small retail. Then, she started saving money and was able to open a small woodshop. Their hard work and clever hands earned them more income. Currently, her family income is 200 USD\/month. She wants to borrow 550 USD to buy more wood and expand the workshop. She also will use a small amount from the borrowed money to invest in small retail. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Ph\u1ea1m Th\u1ecb T. n\u0103m nay 50 tu\u1ed5i.

Bamenda, Cameroon.  Mary plans to buy and sell palm oil and farm on land she already owns.  She will divide her loan between purchasing palm oil, paying for the cultivation of her farm land, and spending on transportation.  She plans to contribute 250,000 CFA (approximately $500 USD) of her own savings towards her business plans.\r\n\r\nThis is Mary`s fourth loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2004.  From her past experience, palm oil is in high demand in her area and she is confident that she can sell it quite quickly.  Bringing palm oil and vegetables from her farm to her community will reduce the transportation costs of her clients. These clients will be able to purchase these items nearby.  She is confident that this loan will allow her to provide more products and therefore sell more.\r\n\r\nWith the profits from this loan, Mary hopes to expand her business and farming activities.  She also plans to support her children, improve their education, and increase her family`s living standards. She knows she will not have a problem with her repayments because her loan schedule is designed so that her payments are small and regular.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":223233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Julia is full of optimism and enthusiasm when she thinks of her future.\r\n\r\nShe started working as a seamstress in a textile factory.  Because she had a bad experience with the care provided to her children by someone else, she decided to leave her work and open a business which would allow her to be close to her children while she worked as they are only 10, eight and four years old.  At that time they were even younger.  \r\n\r\nBecause of this, she thought to sell food.  With the money from the severance from her work in the factory she bought a street cart which is her main tool from which she travels, selling fried foods.  For two years she sold sandwiches, salchipapas [fried hot dogs with french fries] and other foods, offering more dishes as her clientele grew.\r\n\r\nShe is now in the process of making her dream of owning her own business a reality: to have a soda fountain in her home in order to sell drinks as well as food and giving her clients better service.  Construction is only halfway done, but she is already thinking of what will come after it is complete:  she wants to expand in order to open a restaurant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":294807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To build her new soda fountain","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-03-29T14:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia Estela, ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":390,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":18.29,"local_amount":17.83,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:30Z","rounded_local_amount":18.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27085008},{"amount":81.71,"local_amount":79.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":81.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978500},{"amount":208.72,"local_amount":203.5,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-21T07:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":208.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439388},{"amount":91.28,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2009-12-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":91.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780250}],"funded_date":"2009-03-29T15:47:02Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":102251,"name":"Anane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anane Q. sells ladies undergarments in Eguase near Cape Coast.

She lives with her two children who are studying for professional careers in the regional university.\r\n\r\nFor two years she has been selling lollipops and ice cream from her house.  But, that is not the only business she has.  She also has a carpentry shop in another location, which is two hours from her house.  Her husband is the carpenter, and he is in charge of making the furniture.  She sells it.  She has had the shop for 30 years, and it has gone very well for them.\r\n\r\nWhat Bertha likes about her activities is that they keep her busy.  In the mornings she is in her carpentry shop, and in the afternoon she is in her house selling the lollipops.  Also, both businesses generate enough income to pay their expenses.\r\n\r\nLater on she would like to have a sawmill.\r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP.  What she likes about her community bank is that all of the members know each other and there is good communication.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money she is asking for to buy more ice cream and lollipops for 100 PEN.  With the rest of the money she will buy wood to make furniture.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":353762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-18T14:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":45.8},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":46.54},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":48.8},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50.82},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":53.07},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":54.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.51},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.27},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.94},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.69},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":15.27,"local_amount":45.8,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:27Z","rounded_local_amount":46.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63212016},{"amount":15.51,"local_amount":46.54,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":47.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641551},{"amount":16.27,"local_amount":48.8,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":49.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080991},{"amount":16.94,"local_amount":50.82,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":51.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997130},{"amount":17.69,"local_amount":53.07,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":53.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842486},{"amount":18.32,"local_amount":54.97,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":55.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734064}],"funded_date":"2009-07-18T14:55:06Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":126827,"name":"Area Five Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sulum is a member of Area Five Group in Kola, Morogoro.

operator is our featured entrepreneur of this story. She is Mrs. Rebecca T., 40 years of age, married and a resident of P1 San Apolinario, Tangub City. She is married to Rene T., who drives their motor cab for hire. Unfortunately, the couple are still not blessed with any children. <P>\r\n\r\nThey started this \"okay-okay\" and sari-sari store business a year ago, and at this time they are earning an average net income of not less than 10,000 PHP. Her husband is also earning an average net income of 9,700 PHP a month from service as a motorcab driver. Rebecca joined PAGLAUM MPC just this year because she is very much interested in our products and services as we are one of the outstanding cooperatives in Northern Mindanao, awarded Most Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines during the search for COOP-LGU Partnership Award 2006. <P>\r\n\r\nWith her good credit record based on her 1st loan history, she is given the privilege of accessing the amount of 50,000 PHP to add to her capital for her existing \"okay-okay'\" business. Their future plan in life is to have an additional outlet or display stand for their \"okay-okay\" business. The future income from this loan is for basic needs and savings for their

Two of the children are now working, three are school age and five are still infants. Her daughter is with her in the picture. The couple felt some hardships, especially in raising their 10 children. To help her husband, she decided to engage in business and opened up a sari-sari store in her house. For 10 years, she has been able to sustain the business. At this time she is earning an average net income of not less than P2,500 a month. This amount is so beneficial to their family, especially in meeting their daily needs. She undoubtedly joined the cooperative in 2010. As a newly recognized member, she is given the privilege to borrow P5,000 to add to her capital for her existing sari-sari store business. The future income from this loan will be used for their daily needs, tuition fees, loan repayments and savings for future use. She is hoping that someday all her children can graduate from college with the help of this business.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

For the past 12 years she has been working alongside her husband in the brick factory they own. They work tirelessly to produce large quantities of quality bricks. It is hard work because it requires much physical effort. Her partner gets up at dawn to heat the oven and in the morning Zenaida helps with the preparation of the clay to shape it. Later it is put in the brick moulds, which are left out to dry in the sun for a whole day. Once dry, the bricks are baked for 24 hours in the oven. She says it is very demanding work but also very profitable, and that is why she wants to have a larger brick factory. \r\n\r\nThis is her loan number fourteen with MFP. She is very happy to have financial backing as she has always proven to be very responsible with her payments. She also enjoys being part of the loan group because all members are responsible and very supportive.

By the grace of God, Marivic has managed to support her older children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to send her youngest to college. This is the dream for most Filipino parents like Marivic, as she herself has been a college graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMarivic does a little sideline work besides her handwoven bags and scapulars business: she has a trading business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers, then sells items piecemeal with a small profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing, and other items. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options that are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMarivic dreams to be able to give her all her children a high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.

","en":"Burmakan is 44 years old, a widow and has three children.  Because Burmakan is the only provider for her family, she uses all her efforts to support all of her children's needs.  She started her retail business in 1996.  Having taken out a loan in the sum of 22,000 som (KGS) in 2005, Burmakan chose to focus on sales of children's clothing and repaid that loan in a timely manner and without delays.

L. was born on December 24, 1973 in Padhe district which is located in the northern part of Uganda. She is a responsible widow with a daughter age 13 in primary seven. Mary was forced to stop her own studies very young because her parents died and this left no one to pay her school fees. The parents died when there was crossfire between LRA rebels and the Government troops in 1986.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 2003 Mary became involved with the Charity for Peace night commuter center where she was handling over 2,500 kids who come there seeking night shelter because they fear the rebel group called the LRA. Mary volunteered as a caregiver for the children and became a member of Life in Africa when they opened the WE Center on the Charity of Peace property. This is a real voluntary service that she performed without payment.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDuring the daytime, Mary is a committed farmer, and she also does some petty businesses in the market place after her garden work is finished. She does well, but she now needs to expand her business to increase her savings, especially since her daughter will enter high school next year.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMary is seeking a loan in the amount of 250,000\/= (USD 150). This money will make it possible to buy more goods for her produce business to add to what she grows, and it will provide her with a store in which to sell her goods. She is confident that with her experience she will be a success and will be able to provide more for her daughter. She believes she will be able to repay this loan in 6 months.
