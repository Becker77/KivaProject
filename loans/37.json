She is 51 years old, married, and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, Shirly owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling canned goods, snack foods, detergents, instant noodles, shampoo, soap, and beverages in the local community. Shirly has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Shirly joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Shirly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. Shirly is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods, detergents, and  beverages. This loan will be Shirly's fifth loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is a single mother. She lives with her two children, who are students in a small education center in their city. She decided to begin her business work outside her own home. Noticing the business opportunity offered by the location in front of the health clinic, she did not hesitate in moving her food sales to that space. In little time she was sought by a large number of people who daily go to the health clinic to receive medical attention to alleviate their problems. The delicious dishes she prepares and sells since very early in the day have become a favorite of many of the people who visit that place until the afternoon. This drove her to buy a tent to protect herself from the hot sun and also to offer comfort to her clients. In addition, she can count with the support of her children in giving attention to her clients in the busiest times. She requests US$ 350 to buy a new tent, kitchen utensils and products to prepare her dishes, which will allow her to increase the quantity and variety of dishes she offers daily. Let's make it possible for this hardworking mother to continue cooking her excellent dishes and decorating each one of them with her family's dreams.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Eliana Colunga, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica es madre soltera, vive con sus dos hijos, los cuales est\u00e1n cursando estudios en un peque\u00f1o centro educativo de su ciudad.Decidi\u00f3 empezar su labor comercializadora  en las afueras de su hogar y observando la oportunidad de negocio que se presentaba en el frontis de la posta de salud no dud\u00f3 en trasladar su espacio de ventas hasta este espacio.En poco tiempo  tuvo acogida del inmenso n\u00famero de personas que acude a diario para recibir distintas atenciones con el prop\u00f3sito de contrarrestar sus males.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It also has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's history<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The family lives in Gilside, Brgy. Nabulao, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nFlorenda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired toward something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florenda has been working hard and incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 6,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, which helped to improve the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to purchase an expanded inventory for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Florenda Ca\u00f1ete is truly a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

She lives in Toledo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 2,900. Laurita is borrowing PHP 10,000 to fund the operations of her business. This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Laurita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her dream is to be able to expand her business (to buy counters and a freezer, among other things). From talking to her customers, she has also realized that it would be a good idea to start selling clothing.

The eldest is attending senior high school, while the younger one is in elementary school. Her husband, Salim, does not have a fixed job, so he does odd jobs, carrying goods and off-loading trucks when he can.\r\n\r\nR. buys waste material like plastic cups, plastic bottles, cardboard and paper from her neighbors and other houses in the village. Her husband uses a cart to collect scrap metal and other waste material. Households do not just give away waste material, because there is demand and therefore economic value in recycling. So the more working capital they have, the more scrap they can collect and recycle. Their own working capital is limited, at around $250. Having heard from her friends about MBK, R. has now applied to MBK to add to her working capital. Since this is the first time, R. can only borrow a maximum of $75 from MBK.\r\n\r\nThe recycling business consists of the following chain. R. and her husband are the first link in this chair, buying waste and scrap materials from households, sorting and cleaning them, before selling them to an intermediate dealer. This dealer comes around in a small truck, collects the sorted-out material and takes it to the warehouse dealer. There, the different materials are weighed in front of R.\u2019s husband, who then gets paid by the intermediate dealer. The warehouse dealer in turn sends the waste material to various processing factories, which turn produce clean and reusable recycled paper, cardboard and plastic recycled raw materials. Waste recycling undertaken by R. and her husband thus helps clean the environment by reusing waste material which otherwise would go to the landfills.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":15707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase waste material","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Tangerang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.178056 106.63","type":"point"}},"partner_id":43,"posted_date":"2007-02-15T08:01:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosidah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-01T09:01:34Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":75,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":14,"local_amount":14,"processed_date":"2007-05-01T09:27:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14523},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2007-06-01T09:18:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19311},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2007-07-01T09:20:15Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27958},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2007-08-01T09:21:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":37755},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2007-09-01T09:21:57Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":49156},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2007-10-01T09:20:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":61361},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2007-11-01T10:20:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":74760},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2007-12-01T10:19:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":89451},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2008-01-01T10:17:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":105907},{"amount":5,"local_amount":5,"processed_date":"2008-02-01T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":125770}],"funded_date":"2007-02-15T09:01:34Z","paid_date":"2008-02-01T10:18:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":8748,"name":"Aniva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aniva is fifty-four years of age and has six children.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":205079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy maize flour, soda, rice, and wheat flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-19T13:20:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Debora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-03T15:43:31Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348014},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970597},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886814},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436074},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130347},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:14Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027172},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613212},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010295},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232606},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664422}],"funded_date":"2008-09-19T15:43:31Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":70212,"name":"Marivel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Marivel, socia del Banco Comunal \u201cLas Victorias\u201d, vive en el departamento de San Mart\u00edn, provincia de Mariscal C\u00e1ceres, distrito de Juanjui.

Atoullo is a 29-year-old man who is married and has two children. Atoullo\u2019s goals are to grow in his personal life and in his business. His wish is to offer better service to his customers. His dream is that God continues to provide him with more life so that he can get ahead and fulfill his goals.\n\nHe is a taxi driver and travels the streets of Dushanbe City in search of customers. He has owned his business for two years. \n\nToday, Atoullo is planning to replace the fuel supply system of his taxi with one using liquified gas, as the gas is cheaper than petrol (gasoline). For this purpose he wants to borrow $800.\n\nHe sincerely thanks Kiva and all its lenders for making this help possible.  \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her own house with her husband Miguel, who is 35 years old, and their daughter Elena, who is 8 years old. Basilia wants to give them a better life. The hard-working Basilia wakes up at 6 in the morning, when she opens her grocery store and prepares to begin selling her products. Her store is located in the neighborhood of La Rinconada, which is an important neighborhood in the city of Juliaca. She works at her grocery store all day, until 9 at night, when she closes the store, knowing that the next day will bring another long work-day. What she likes most about her business is talking with her clients; this makes the long days more pleasant. She has spent 4 years working in her business. What she likes least is having to spend all day in her store, even though she knows that her sacrifice is not in vain. In the near future, she hopes to have a larger store, where she can sell more varied products. This is her first loan with MFP, and she knows that she has to pay her installments on time. In her community bank, she is very happy and is always up to date with the agreements that exist among the members. With the 1000 soles that she is requesting, she will buy more products for her store and will be able to offer more items to her clients. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":355173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-21T18:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:04Z","rounded_local_amount":175.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63212053},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:08Z","rounded_local_amount":175.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641588},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":175.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081028},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":175.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997178},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":175.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842522},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:44Z","rounded_local_amount":173.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734098}],"funded_date":"2009-07-21T21:12:07Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":127556,"name":"Celenia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celenia, at the age of forty-six, is a woman full of dreams that remain unrealized due to unceasing hardships prevalent in the country.

She is 45 years old. Lyndie is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Lyndie owns and operates a business raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Lyndie has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Lyndie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lyndie is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional feed. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Lyndie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her general living conditions. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

R. is 36 years old and lives with his wife and two children in the neighborhood of Jos\u00e9 Dolores Estrada.  His children currently attend elementary school while his wife takes care of the housework.  Douglas has worked as a carpenter for seven years.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he started his carpentry apprenticeship, Douglas had the support of his family and bought basic tools to establish a small workshop.

Abduhalim is 31 years old, married and has three children. He is a farmer growing onions, corn, rice, and nuts--something he has done for 11 years. This is the only thing he knows how to do and what he likes most to do. For Abduhalim, there is nothing better than being in touch with nature and watching the crops he has planted grow year after year.\r\n\r\n In addition, Abduhalim raises cattle and his family helps him with his business. Now he wants to borrow money to purchase seeds and fertilizer for his crops. This is the second loan of Abduhalim from IMON International and he promises to repay the loan without any violations as he did with his previous loan. \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They have nine children who are between 32 and  47 years old. Ma. Luz joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1990 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 21 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Luz has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 22nd loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to purchase stock so that she can continue to save up for the future. Ma.

She learned how to bake from her parents who have an oven and made bread and cakes to sell. What she likes most about her job is decorating her cakes. She has a lot of patience to decorate and this can be seen in the beautiful designs she makes. She has been working in this business for 10 years and considers staying up late to finish orders to be the most difficult part. This will be her 10th loan with MFP. She has always been punctual with her payments and plans to do the same for these payments. In her communal bank she is a responsible member which is why she is well liked. With the three thousand Peruvian Soles loan she will buy new display cabinets to open her new bakery."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":794865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy display cabinets to sell her cakes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":453.18},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":471.3},{"due_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":487.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":507.49},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":529.95},{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":550.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.81},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.69},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.08},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.31},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":201.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":166.17,"local_amount":453.18,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":458.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550487},{"amount":172.81,"local_amount":471.3,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":477.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719174},{"amount":761.02,"local_amount":2075.52,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2101.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350637}],"funded_date":"2011-06-22T16:40:47Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Garza","image":688224}},{"id":312800,"name":"Gotitas De Amor Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Felipa es integrante D. la  Alcanc\u00eda Comunal \u201cGotitas D.

small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

All her children are attending a local elementary school. Her family lives in a 'ger\u2019 (traditional nomadic tent) district in Arhanghay, one of Mongolia\u2019s central provinces. Together with her husband, she has been running a small cafe since 2002. Her cafe is located in the center of the province and meals are sold at a cheap price. One meal is around $2 USD because local residents cannot spend a lot to eat out. However, she has many repeat clients. Besides running a cafe, she also runs a retail business selling meat.

Her husband and her children help with the brush clearing and weeding.  Talafaaiva hauls a taro crop to the local market every day to sell.  Taro is a staple of the Samoan diet, and she has no trouble finding demand for her product.  Customers even come by her home asking to buy taro.  Her family is confident that growing the taro crop is the key to raising their standard of living, and so Talafaaiva is applying for a loan to purchase time-saving equipment to that they can expand their plantation.

She did not have a chance to go to school so she is illiterate, for this reason she was afraid of meetings. With the love and support from her group, she applied for and received a loan. She invested the money into raising pigs and poultry.  It was a success, the business grew and grew so she was successful in securing bigger loans in later rounds. She had overcome her shyness and became an active member of TYM branch 3 in the village of Nam Vi\u00eam, Ph\u00fac Y\u00ean where she lives with her husband and 3 children. Ms Tuy\u1ebft requests a loan of 575 USD to buy food and more ducks for her paddling of 60 + ducks.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

children. He is a specialist in radio and television equipment repair. He began working in 1980 as an apprentice. As he gradually amassed experience in this area, Nasrullo  began to independently accept contracts and to repair radio receiver sets. Today he is known across the district as a master of his trade. Any client who comes to him with equipment to be fixed leaves with a smile on his face. To provide his services Nasrullo travels to the city Dushanbe to buy spare parts and accessories for audio and video equipment from the company Goluboy Ekran, LLC. \r\n<p>\r\nNasrullo dreams of expending his buisness, building a private shop and mentoring apprentices. When he found out about Kiva he decided to take part and take out a loan of 4100 somoni ($1200) to bring his dreams into reality. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva

He grows onions, watermelons, and wheat on his land. His family is made up of his wife and his three children whom he provides with the education that they deserve. It is important to point out that this gentleman has succeeded in this business and has been able to improve the conditions of his business thanks to his sacrifices and great efforts.<P>\r\n\r\n IMON International has been an important factor in his business's growth as it has given Andokul three loans which he has used to purchase supplies for his crops. Today he needs a loan to provide technological assistance to his crops which is why he confidently waits the approval of this loan knowing that it will be of great use in this business and that his family will greatly benefit. Andokul and his family sincerely thank you!<P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

G. is a 37 year-old mother of four who runs her own retail store in the town of El Seybo, Dominican Republic.  She is hoping to take out her third loan of 15,000 pesos to buy additional pants, blouses, and other men's and women's clothing for her small business.\r\n\r\nSince becoming a client of Kiva and Esperanza International, Fernanda reports that her life has changed significantly for the better. Revenue from her clothing store provides an additional source of income to what her husband earns selling bananas, yucca, and other food products on the streets of El Seybo.  Most importantly, Fernanda's income helps support her four children (ages 17, 15, 13, and 11), the oldest of whom has had chronic health problems.

M. was born in the city of Maputo, in southern Mozambique.  She is 44 years old, is separated from her husband and is the mother of 3 children aged 21, 17, and 14.  They all attend school.  Valentina only completed eighth graD.; she did not continue because of an early pregnancy.  Her husband did not allow her to return to school after the baby's birth.  She lives in her own house with her niece because her children stayed with their father after their separation.  She supports her mother, who does not live with her, by sending her money and food.\r\n\r\nShe left the city of Matola to go to Boane seven years after the separation.  She is still living in this district with her niece.  She has had her own business for more than seven years.  She works about 12 hours per day selling beer and soft drinks, and she has no employees.  Valentina learned this job with some friends who lived in her neighborhood in Matola.  She makes about 5,000 MZN per month, which she uses for household expenses while saving some money at home for unexpected expenses.\r\n\r\nValentina has never taken out loans from other banks.  She learned about Hluvuku through a friend who is also a client here.  This is Valentina's fourth loan.

Adolat is married and has one child. She lives in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Her son (who is in this photo) helps her in this business. She has two working places in the market of Shohmansur and that\u2019s why she needs a wider assortment of more goods. Two years ago, during a fire in the market, her goods were burned and she left without capital. With the help of IMON International, she started her business again. Now she plans to purchase a new assortment of goods and for this she has requested a loan of 3,000 USD. \n   \nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Balingasag, Misamis Oriental. She buys and prepares a variety of viands for different meals such as afritada, pancit bihon, and fried chicken. Cerelina has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month. She and her husband have two school-aged children.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Cerelina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Cerelina has successfully repaid her most recent previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional ingredients and was employed as working capital. Cerelina is now requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to prepare her meals, such as meat, spices, and vegetables. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Cerelina from HSPFI.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Solaua's fourth loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  PBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

Right now all his children are in a community school in the town where he lives. Samuel lives in a farming community called Abofour, a suburb of Offinso in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Abofour is a forest reserve area and the most popular occupation is farming. Most of the people are farmers and the illiteracy rate there is very high among the adults. \r\n\r\nSamuel is a seasoned farmer and he has been farming cocoa and cereals like maize for more than twelve years, to take care of his family. Through this, he has managed to build a two bed room house in the village.

Now she would like a loan to start selling used clothing. Fior said she has a contact in the nearby town of Sanchez where she can get a very good deal on loads of used clothing that have been shipped from the United States. With this loan, she will be able to travel to Sanchez and buy those clothes to sell from her house. \r\n\r\n<p>Fior and her husband, Manuel, have three children, ages 9, 7 and 4. The two oldest are in school and the youngest one looks forward to starting school next year. Fior hopes that with this new business plan she can save enough money to be able to send all her children to the university some day.\r\n\r\n<p>Fior and everyone in the Sabanalamarinos Unidos 2 group

She is 50 years of age and is blessed with four loving and supportive children whose age range is from 11 to 24 years old. Despite poverty and a difficult way of surviving, Sylvia still feels happy and courageous because of the love and inspiration her husband (named Joyce) gives her all the time. He works as a village policeman and is receiving a small honorarium every month. They would not have been able to cover the expenses of their children if not for Sylvia\u2019s small business. She joined ASHI, a Kiva field partner in the Philippines, and thereafter she had the opportunity to request loans which enable her to support and grow her sweetened-peanut and sweetened-cashew nut-selling business. \r\n\r\nSylvia started with this business by selling the nuts herself in the market, but she was making only a small profit. Her customers were not as regular as before and were not purchasing large amounts of her product. After several times of receiving loans in increasing amounts through ASHI, Sylvia\u2019s volume of production increased and her business became capable of supplying the demands of her customers. \r\n\r\nShe wants to expand even further, especially now that she is supplying three stall owners in the market who sell \u201cpasalubong\u201d, which in the English language means a souvenir or homecoming present (a Filipino cultural tradition). Consequently, Sylvia would like to request a much larger loan this time from Kiva through ASHI. \r\n\r\nThe proceeds from her business will be spent for her children\u2019s education, which is the only reason for her continued determination. Sylvia believes that through her business the lives of her children will be different from hers and her husband\u2019s.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":490943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":516422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional wheat flour, maize flour for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Coastal Region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pilly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":194015,"name":"Mallorina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mallorina C. is a 56-year-old married woman with four children who lives in Sitio Macasayang, Barangay Mabini, Cadiz City, Negros Occidental.

The solar lantern offers a free, environment-friendly renewable source of energy, that allows them to reduce their monthly fuel costs.   \r\n\t\t\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":524763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

This group is located in the municipality of Zitacuaro in the State of Michoac\u00e1n. It is made up of 12 members. \r\n\r\nThe group's representative is Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles R. \u00c1ngeles. She is 44 years old and married to Rafael who is a truck driver. They have three children but only two live with them, Guadalupe, 19, and Lucero, 14, who is a middle-school student. Rosa comments that her daughter Guadalupe did not continue in her high school studies this year for lack of resources. She comments that she did not have enough money for enrollment and school fees because her daughter-in-law had to have an operation and the hospital bill was very high. Ms. \u00c1ngeles is seeking her loan to invest in her clothing business. She says her best-sellers are ladies' jeans and she also sells socks and underwear for women and children. She comments that she is putting a lot into her work because she wants her daughter to go back to high school and not keep missing years. She sells her clothing to her customers at their homes and she also sells prepared suppers on the weekends. Right now one of her goals is to acquire more customers and to start selling at the open-air markets in surrounding areas. Her dream is to start a paper and gifts business in her home so that she may keep up with her home and daughters. \r\n\r\nNancy Mart\u00ednez Garc\u00eda is a member of \"Splash\". She is 22 years old and studies Education at the UPN (National Pedagogical University) in the Municipality of Zitacuaro of the State of Michoac\u00e1n. Although she has not yet graduated she is getting together the money to graduate as it is quite expensive. She has an eighteen-month-old daughter named Jimena. Nancy is a single mother and very hard-working. She sells plastic products such as buckets, trash cans, tubs, scrubbers, brooms, mops, hangers etc. She sells her products at the open-air markets of Zitacuaro. She decided to start this business in order to support her small child and to save up for obtaining her degree. She also says that her customers come looking for her at home to buy from her. She is seeking this loan to invest in plastics and hopes also to sell cleaning products such as soap, shampoo, fabric softeners, bleach and other products.

He has a business making windows, doors and aluminum frames that he learned when he was an employee in a large firm in Barranquilla in 1995.  When he was laid off in 2000 he managed to set up his own micro business with a small domestic market share.  Gradually he has become better known around Galapa having started with his relatives, friends and neighbors.
