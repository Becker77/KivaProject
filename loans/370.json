He is 39 years old and went to school until the 4th grade.  He is married and the father of 5 children with ages between one month and 16 years.  The three oldest are in school.\r\n\r\nCarlos left Inhambane when he was obligated to serve in the military.  After he concluded his service he continued with his studies but had to stop when he was called another time by the army (The homeland calls for us).  Immediately he left Inhambane for Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, to search for work.  He worked as a domestic helper for 5 years.  In 1996 he began his own business of selling jugs acquired in Maputo and sold in neighboring South Africa.\r\n\r\nHe travels two times per month since he has to coincide with the payment periods for elderly pensions.  He purchases 50 jugs for 6,000MT and after paying for transportation expenses Carlos has had a profit of 10,000MT.  He is able to save 2,000MT per month because besides his children he is also responsible for his mother who lives in Inhambane, and he sends her 1,000MT every 4 months.\r\n\r\nThis is Carlos' fourth loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva.  The first 3 were used to purchase jugs to resell, and this loan of 8,500MT will be used for the same purpose.  He is confident that he can pay off the loan before maturity so he can request another loan to begin work on his construction.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":323987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase and sale of jugs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Afonso ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":8500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":461.2},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":480.16},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":499.89},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":520.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":541.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":564.09},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":587.27},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":611.4},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":636.53},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":662.69},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":689.92},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":718.28},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":747.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":778.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.95},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.64},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.37},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.91},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.58},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.47},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.39},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.39},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":105991,"name":"Lillian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lillian sells second hand clothes and shoes in her shop.

Rustam is a very responsible and optimistic person; he has two children and a wife whom he has to support. Rustam wishes to develop his business. This business consists of raising cows in his village because there is a very high demand for milk from villagers and especially from customers who come from enclosed towns. <P>\r\n\r\nRustam is helped by his wife. He is currently faced with many problems because his children are growing and, accordingly, their expenses are growing, too. The only way to get out of this difficulty is to succeed in business, so we hope that his capabilities and the services provided by IMON International will help him improve the business. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Emma is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to pay services extended by laborers plowing her corn field. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Emma from HSPFI.

Sophun, 52, has been married for 15 years to her second husband.  Between the two of them they have several children, but only one still lives at home with her husband and young son. Also under their care are one granddaughter and Sophun's elderly mother. Since they are older, Sophun and her husband now mainly take care of the family and tend their fruit trees. They also raise cows. Sophun's granddaughter, 20, and daughter, 28, are two of the primary supporters now as they have secure jobs in the local garment factory.  \r\n\r\nSophun is requesting her third loan from MAXIMA in the amount of $500. She will use this loan, in addition to other money she has saved, to purchase supplies for improvements to their home. Previous loans were used for similar purposes and to build a cow shed.

She works as a motorscooter mechanic and her husband works as a barber.  Currently they have two children who are working as factory workers, so their income is relatively stable at 200,000 VND per day.  She and the group has been participating in the Fund for two cycles, and have done well in repaying their loans.  She very much enjoys this method of borrowing and repayment, since it allows her to repay slowly while saving money to care for her children and make sure they can work steadily.  In this round of funding she registered to borrow 4,704,000 VND to buy equipment to fix and sell motorscooters.  Her group also includes:  Mrs. N. Thi Dang, borrowing 4,704,000 VND to do business in fixing telephones;  Mrs. Quy Thi Le, borrowing 4,704,000 VND to do business buy running a breakfast service; Mrs. Ngoc Thanh Thi Dang, borrowing 4,704,000 VND to computer repair equipment; Mrs. Hoa Thi Nguyen, borrowing 4,704,000 VND to do business selling beverages.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her businesses, she would like to apply for a 47,000 Philippine peso loan. This amount will be used for her expanding businesses to buy raw ingredients needed for food processing and for other needs of her other businesses.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from gathering and selling seaweed to the market. \r\n\r\nHilario joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities.

pet groomers with a robust pet accessories department. They got the idea for the business after adopting their dog Chopper in 2006 and quickly realizing that there was nowhere in town to buy the pet accessories they wanted. Rick, who had spent 18 years as a store manager for a large company, knew he had the experience necessary to open their own store to fill that gap. \u201cHaving my own business is something I\u2019ve always wanted, and I had been thinking about it for years,\u201d said Rick.  \r\n\r\nIn 2010, Opportunity Fund approved Rick and Alaycia for a loan of $5,000. With the help of Kiva lenders backfilling this loan, Rick repaired and upgraded old equipment and built up their business credit.  Over the past year, business expanded so much that they opened a second location in Brentwood, California! They are now employing six people and hope to add even more jobs in the near future.  \r\n\r\nWith the excitement of the grand opening of their second location comes the need for more money to put up new signs in front of the store. Having enjoyed their experience with Opportunity Fund the first time, they approached their local MFI for a second microloan. With this $10,000, they will improve their current marketing efforts and expand their clientele as they open a second location.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":906401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

He is 46 years old, married with two children. Rasul is the sole provider for his family and earns his living by raising and selling cows and sheep at the local market. Every year he purchases young animals from local villagers and raises them over an 8-9 month period and later sells the adult cows and sheep to local butchers.\r\n<p>\r\nToday Rasul is thinking about expanding his business, as his current earnings are not enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase young sheep and feed for them. That\u2019s why he is requesting a loan of $1,000 USD for the term of 9 months.\r\n<p>\r\nPlease extend your solidarity to Rasul so that he can move forth successfully and accomplish all his goals.\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><\/p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, new West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependants because they are orphan their parents died for HIV. \nTupokigwe has been running a Cereals business since 2006. Client\u2019s business is to buy cocoa from farmers and sell in town for higher price.\nShe works at the business for 9 - 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Tupokigwe currently earns about 140 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to buy more cocoa in bulk for reseling. In the future, she plans to increase the stock. Tupokigwe thanks you for your support!\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

He lives with his cousins in the town of Cerrop\u00f3n in the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor two years he has had a motorcycle taxi, which he uses to transport passengers and goods. With this work he pays for his personal expenses. He belongs to a taxi association whose taxi stand is located in La Victoria district, twenty mintures from his home.\r\n\r\nEvery day he leaves very early for his taxi stand to work, but the continual use of his vehicle has led to some damage to the motor. This is why he is applying for a loan for the first time from Edpyme Alternativa. The loan is for 500 new soles which he will invest in maintaining his vehicle. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 dreams of continuing to work and make enough money to purchase a car and keep working as a taxi driver. He will then work to buy a lot to build his home. He is held in high regard by his neighbors and relatives because he is very responsible and hardworking. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":392712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Repairs and maintenance of taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"P.

She has many years of experience in this business.    Lelei needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to financially support extended members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lelei joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Lelei's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.  \r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from secondary\/high-school.

She has two daughters, 6 and 4 years old. Okasana and her husband are farmers, but her husband works as a builder when there is an opportunity. Right after their marriage, her husband suggested breeding cattle. They started breeding cattle together 2 years ago with an initial investment of 10,000 soms. With the help of profits from cattle breeding they improved their living conditions significantly. Now, they receive 1500 soms a month as a profit from cattle breeding and in order to increase their profits they want to buy farm animals. With money received from the loan Okasana wants to purchase two farm animals and hay to feed them during the winter season. This loan would help them increase their profits and provide better living conditions for their two little daughters. \r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\nShaiyr O. is treasurer of the group. She is 60 and married. She has a daughter who is 20. Her daughter works as a seamstress. Her husband is farmer and Shaiyr has been  breeding cattle for almost 2 years. She started breeding cattle with an initial investment of 2500 soms. Now, she makes 1500 soms monthly from cattle breeding. In order to increase her profits, she's planning to buy 4 more ewes, then fatten and sell them at a higher price. She already has educated her daughter about the profits from cattle breeding. Now, she wants to prepare a dowry for her daughter, also from the profits from cattle breeding. \r\n\r\nUlan O. is 35 and married. He has two sons, 9 and 8 years old.   Both of his sons go to school. His wife is a seamstress. Ulan in his turn combines cattle breeding with a job as a taxi driver in order to provide for members of his family. He has been in the cattle breeding business for two years; he started with initial investments of 20,000 soms. Now, it brings him 2000 soms monthly. Like other group members, in order to increase his profits from cattle breeding, he needs more head of cattle. So, this is the first reason for his application for a loan. The second reason is that he needs to make car repairs so as to continue his job as a taxi driver. With the profit from a loan, he is planning to increase significantly the number of head of livestock he has and buy a flat in the capital of Kyrgyzstan (Bishkek) where his children can enjoy better educational opportunities. \r\n\r\nAlmazbek O. is 40 and married. He has two daughters, 6 and 4 years old. His wife is a teacher of the Kyrgyz language at a local school. Almazbek as well as Ulan has to combine his job as an engineer with agriculture in order to provide for members of his family. 7 years ago, he received as a present from his parents an area under cultivation, which pushed him to start sowing potatoes and wheat. He started sowing potatoes and wheat with initial investments of 3000 soms. Profit from agriculture provided for his family and improved the living conditions of his family. Besides this, he bought furniture for his house. His profit from agriculture is 1500 soms per month. Now, he wants to start cattle breeding. In order to start cattle breeding, he needs to buy at least one head of cattle. Thus, he is applying for a loan. This loan will help him to buy one head of cattle and forage for cattle. He believes that he will increase significantly his herd. On the received profits, he wants to make capital repairs on his house and provide better living conditions for his family. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

D. is from the village of Arpeni in the Shirak region of Armenia.  He is married with three children; a 28 year old daughter and two sons (24 and 27 years old).  Garnik has a high school education from his home town of Arpeni.  His daughter is married and lives in the city of Gyumri.  Garnik assists his daughter\u2019s family with home grown vegetables and financial support.  Garnik supports his family with cattle and sheep breeding.  He has been in this work for over 30 years.  He considers himself a hard working yet modest person.  \r\n\r\nGarnik is looking for a loan to purchase additional sheep and feed.

She tells us that it has been very difficult to get her children ahead in life because the wage that her husband earns as a construction worker doesn't cover all their household expenses.  Sometimes he has no work which has made it difficult to achieve financial stability since sources of work are very scarce in their town.

Asmahan wants to replace her old home furniture and purchase new necessary ones such as: bedroom furniture, living room furniture, etc., but she hasn't enough money to pay, so she needs to take a loan from Kiva partner FATEN. When Asmahan gets the loan, she will purchase new home furniture and provide for her family better and comfortable home living conditions. Asmahan is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead in the picture.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

It is thanks to agriculture that he is able to provide for the education and needs of his children. The years have granted him the experience that he needs to be a good farmer. He uses this knowledge everyday to work toward the healthy growth of each one of his plants. Sixto hopes to increase his crops in rented plots, from which, with the help of his bicycle, he easily transports all of his crops. \r\n\r\nSixto is a very responsible client and the first to make his monthly payments. He also helps out by informing the other members if there is an unscheduled meeting of their communal bank. This is his 9th loan with MFP and he is very respected by the other members because of the responsibility he has demonstrated. With the requested 1500 PEN, he will buy chemical fertilizers for his vegetable plots.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":323149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-25T03:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sixto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733856}],"funded_date":"2009-05-25T05:06:28Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":114231,"name":"Nuevo Atardecer Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cNuevo Atardecer\u201d esta representado por la se\u00f1ora Miguelina, Jenny y Dalia que son su presidenta, tesorera y secretaria.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":304233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

She has been engaged in this business for more than four years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP from her work.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Erlinda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and expand her small business.

She plans to use the additional income made possible by this loan to support the education of children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Mahmud is 48 years old and lives with his wife and four children. His plans for his family are to improve their quality of life and give a better education to all his children. \r\n\r\nMahmud began working in the fields two years ago. It was his father who taught him how to work with the earth. Mahmud works in farming and also raises cattle, which he sells to bring in extra income. With this loan he will buy farming supplies so his harvest will be good and he can sell it for a good price in the market. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing transportation services to community members. He also keeps busy buying and selling scrap and waste materials in their community. Jay has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jay joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jay has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase used bottles and newspapers to sell. Jay is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair the motorcycle used in the business. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Jay from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of his children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

When his crops are harvested, they are sold as an additional source of household income.\r\n<p>\r\nIsaul is requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1000 PEN so that he can buy balanced feed for his animals and fertilizers to improve his farmland.  As soon as his poultry are fattened, they will be sold at different markets in the area.  By obtaining a good price for these birds, he will have more money to improve his quality of life.  Isaul is a hardworking and responsible person whose only wish is for his family to move forward, especially seeing his children achieve their goals.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":907400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy balanced feed for his animals and fertilizers for his farmland.
