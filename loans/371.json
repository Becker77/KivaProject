She has had a business selling used handbags for over seven years.  She says that things are going okay, but times have been tough after the post-election violence in Kenya at the end of 2007.  With a low level of stock, she says that she can\u2019t attract a lot of customers.  \r\n<P>\r\nWith a child starting high school in January, Florence is concerned that she will not be able to afford the increased school fees.  She would like to eventually take up small-scale farming in addition to the business she runs in town.  With her loan proceeds, Florence will invest in a fresh supply of used handbags so that she can start bringing in the profits that she once did.

Lima needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 255 tala or US $106 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lima joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lima's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lima A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.99 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.

Her customers are women in her community and those on the move.\r\n<p>\r\nHer challenges include paying high taxes, high rental charges, and transport costs. Flooding is a problem during the rainy season as the area where she is operating is prone to floods, which destroys her merchandise. It was once a wetland. Another challenge is that of her business being seasonal. During periods when there is low demand for salons, she switches to selling cereals and legumes, mainly dried beans. She has been operating this business for the last 10 years and was inspired by the way women were moving long distances looking for salons. She has been able to improve her standards of living, provide her family with three meals daily. Her main inspiration is owning a permanent home to operate from and also seeing her business progressing.\r\n<p>\r\nBeatrice is the leader of a 4-member group. She is 28 years old and married with 2 children. They are 7 and 2 years old. The one aged seven years is in school. She rents a three-room house in which she lives with 5 people. There is no piped water and electricity. She resides and works in a semi-urban and slum area, which is in the outskirts of Kampala."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":192648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2008-09-03T19:50:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teopista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nulu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-17T22:56:08Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":159,"local_amount":251052.63,"processed_date":"2008-10-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-23T07:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":255831,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364932},{"amount":157.67,"local_amount":248947.37,"processed_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-21T20:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":253685.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5334467},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-30T08:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":254758.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9955659},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-18T08:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":254758.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14876029},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":254758.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20421627},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":254758.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27115107}],"funded_date":"2008-09-03T22:56:08Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T20:28:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65503,"name":"Sopheap","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sopheap D., 40, and her husband, Mr. Cheng-ean Hean, 52, live on an island in the Mekong River about fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh.

She is married to Santiago, a farmer. Their eldest son, Florentino, is 22 years old. He graduated from college and is now working as a dental technician in Manila. Their second child, Harold, age 19, is currently studying to be a dental technician in Manila. Next is Myrna, age 16 and Epifanio, age 12, both of whom are studying in high school. Lina hopes that all her children finish their studies because she believes that their achievements in life are also achievements for their parents who supported them all the way.  \r\n\r\nLina is requesting a loan of PHP 4,000 from Kiva. She will use the loan to improve her rice business. She sells rice and vegetables three times a week in the market. When not in the market, she tries to sell her vegetables in their village through house-to-house vending. She hopes that, with patience, she can send all her children to college and attain their dream, which is to finish their studies and look for jobs. She is glad that her husband also works hard as a farmer. They strive to give their children a bright future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":393635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits

Together, they have five children, four of whom live with them: Joel (22), Isabel (18), Nelida (16) and Pa\u00fal (11).\r\n\r\nHer day begins early, as she wakes up eager to work her land planting potatoes with the help of her husband and her children. The work Elizabet does is difficult as the harvest requires constant attention. She knows this and is constantly worried about future harvests since they will be the sustenance of her family for the season. \r\n\r\nAgriculture techniques in the sierras of Peru are passed down from generation to generation. This is how Elizabet learned to work the land at a young age. Today, her motivation is providing a future for her family. At the end of the harvest, she sells everything at a good price to wholesalers. Looking to the future, Elizabet would like to sow and harvest in larger quantities, and not only potatoes but other produce as well. \r\n\r\nThis is Elizabet's sixth loan with Kiva partner MFP and she is confident she will make her payments timely since she is responsible and does not want to lose face with anyone or with her community bank and its members, hardworking people like her. With the loan, she will buy fertilizers and pesticides to protect her land from pests and ensure a fruitful harvest.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":453943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buying fertilizer and pesticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T21:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1008,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672756}],"funded_date":"2009-12-22T20:12:37Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Violeta Rubiani","image":null}},{"id":168208,"name":"Siua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Siua L. is 34 and single with no children.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

Anipa is 40. She has a big family that consists of her, her husband and four children. Anipa lives in the city of Karabalta, which is 60 kilometers to the west of Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nOne of the main life priorities for Anipa has been to give all her children a proper education so that they have more favorable opportunities in their lives. To provide it, they saved their earnings and invested in purchasing a calf. Gradually, they increased the total population of livestock and began selling milk. Now, Anipa can boast about what a good household she and her husband together operate. \r\n\r\nTheir eldest daughter has become a schoolteacher herself, and she is just 20. Two other children are still attending a secondary school. The little son is just 5 and stays at home by Anipa\u2019s side. Raising livestock has been the main source of income for Anipa and her family for 25 years. And due to it, Anipa has been successfully raising her children and satisfying her daily needs. \r\n\r\nRecently, Anipa has applied for this loan. The reason for that is that for the rest of the winter season, Anipa urgently needs coal for heating her house. However, her monthly income of $73 does not allow her to make this purchase. Therefore, she hopes to obtain this loan and be able to buy coal. \r\n\r\nAnipa\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nTemirbek, 56, is the father of four children. His wife is unemployed. Temirbek is engaged in breeding cattle and selling milk. He needs a loan to buy a piece of land for his son. His son is married and needs to build his own household.\r\n\r\nFlyura, 43, is a housewife. She keeps a household and sells milk. Her husband works as a welder. Together they are raising five children. Flyura needs to obtain this loan to be able to attend a funeral of a close relative of hers. \r\n\r\nDinara, 38, is a mother of five children. Her husband and elder children support the family by keeping sheep. They have applied for this loan to purchase furniture.\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept: People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

He and his entire family live in a house with seven rooms in Ndamukong. This very hard working man joined GHAPE in 2008. H. has encountered some problems in life, such as the death of his father, mother, brother and child in 1992. He was also regrettably unable to continue school, which he loved so much. He became frustrated after he dropped out of school. Thanks to GHAPE, which was created at the time when he most needed it, H. resorted to thinking about going into business. He joined GHAPE and collected his first loan of 37,500 XAF to begin farming and selling firewood. \r\n\r\n<p>As a young talented man, even though things are not moving well with his family since his wife has undergone surgery, he is determined to make it in life. With the skills and trainings received from GHAPE, he has been able to improve his living standards. He farms and runs his firewood business for a living. He plans to invest this loan in buying firewood and seedlings along with feed for his piglets, bought with previous loans.\r\n\r\nH. has been quite successful in the past with his business and is now earning good profit from it due to the fact that he has lots of experience. Part of his profits from this loan will be used to take care of his children, buy necessities for the family and get good medication for them whenever they are sick.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  hog raising and swine raising. Her husband, Charlie V., who is 56 years old, works as a hog raiser to earn his living. They have two children who are 26 and 27 years old. \r\n\r\nErna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for their future and to improve their living conditions. Erna V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

This is where he established his family with his wife of 16 years, Ang\u00e9lica.  They have a daughter, Joyce.  They take care of her with a lot of affection in their own house.\r\n\r\nAs a hard-working and responsible man, Luis devotes his time and effort to faming.  Six months ago he started to work the two hectares of farming land that his wife inherited.  He started by planting bananas.  Now he already has coffee amongst his crops, which is augmenting his production.  He also receives training from the cooperative in the area where he sells the mature coffee beans.  He thereby produces a better quality of coffee every year.\r\n\r\nHowever, the business activity that generates steady income is buying and selling bananas and seasonal fruit.  He does this in the city of Huancayo, where he constantly travels.  After getting together the fruit from the farmers in the area, he heads to the wholesale market in the city.

She is an open-minded person with an entrepreneurial spirit. Jeluwaida wants to start a business in agriculture and wants her students to also develop interest in entrepreneurship. As first step, she decided to invest in a solar home system because her small house was not connected to the public power grid.

Normally, she buys her merchandise from recognized professionals, rural people in surrounding villages (Bananida, Konobougou for example), and sometimes in S\u00e9gou itself. \r\n\r\nA\u00efssa G. sells out of her home, on a cash or credit basis, to a clientele consisting of housewives and bakers.  She takes orders and delivers to their place of work.  She hopes to earn a monthly profit of $83 (40,000 West African frances), which would enable her to discharge her family responsibilities and to put money back into the business.\r\n\r\n<br

Besides her children, she supports 4 nieces and nephews who live with her. \r\n\r\nPalmira studied until the 6th grade and then stopped because she lacked the conditions to continue. The education in her zone only went up to 6th grade, and her parents weren\u2019t able to send her to boarding school outside the district. Since her childhood, Palmira has never lived in another zone. She lives in her own house. \r\n\r\nPalmira is a businesswoman and sells a variety of products ranging from peanuts, beans, sugar, oil, etc. She has a daily income of 1500 MT.

She found out about Hluvuku through advertising done by Hluvuku promoters at the market. \r\n\r\nPalmira is confident she can pay before the estimated time because she has a project of building rooms for rent in her yard.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is a farmer, and in spite of his youth he supports his family with hard work and dedication. He is always in the fields growing grapes, leaving early in the morning to water the fields and then fertilize and fumigate the crops. This work is satisfying, and it enables him to purchase goods for his home. Raufboy would like to request a loan of 7000 Somoni which he can use to buy necessary farm inputs like fertilizers since they are very expensive. He is very optimistic that this amount will improve his yield and he hopes to have a continuous partnership with the lenders. Raufboy always makes sure that he respects the people around him since he believes that respect begets respect.     \r\n \r\nAbout Tajikistan:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He owns a business selling clothing and footwear at the local market. His vending kiosk offers a wide variety of merchandise that is regularly restocked. Affordable prices and a nice selection have helped Farhod stay afloat with his business for six years. In fact, he has not only managed to keep his business sustainable and profitable, but has also increased his working capital. Farhod decided to go into this line of business because competition is lacking. He feels comfortable selling this type of inventory. Farhod is a focused entrepreneur looking for growth and further expansion of his venture. He believes an increase in assorted merchandise will guarantee increased sales and consistent development of his business. Farhod is requesting a loan of $1,000 USD to increase his working capital. \r\n                                                                                    \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She thanks you for your support. Dairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":802183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-06-30T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.61,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221743309},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-26T08:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227594770},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5107.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691510},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647875},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-28T09:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865008},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257274992},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416458},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-24T08:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270131260},{"amount":103.64,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-26T08:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":7660.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.61,"payment_id":283296459}],"funded_date":"2011-06-30T04:57:24Z","paid_date":"2012-06-26T08:09:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":316328,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is age 45 and a married mother of five children, four of whom are currently attending school. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last 30 years in her hometown in eastern Kenya. Her mixed farm produces bananas, maize and milk, which she sells to the local market. Farming has been her main source of income and she is glad that the income from her farm has enabled her to cater to her family's needs. \r\n\r\nLucy has made a loan request of 60,000 KES to buy chickens and poultry feed for her poultry farm. She says that the income that will be generated through this project will be used to pay school fees for her children.

He is also sociable and cheerful.  He is married to Madeleine who is an independent saleswoman.  Jairo lives together with his wife, his two children (12 and 10 years old), and his mother who he cares for owing to her old age.  They all live comfortably in their own home which Jairo managed to buy with a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nJairo's business is transporting passengers.  He started four years ago, buying  a vehicle with the severance pay that he received when he left his job at a private company.  He saw the need to start working in a business activity and chose transportation.  He managed to grow his new business and currently has two cars and a motorcycle taxi.  He drives one of the cars himself and hires the other one out (he does the same with the motorcycle taxi).  In this way, he makes several incomes.  What Jairo enjoys about his work is the income that it makes and the fact that it allows him to cover his household expenses and his children's education expenses.  On the contrary, what he does not enjoy about his work is the stress and the eye strain which he suffers from because he spends so many hours at the wheel, driving his car.  For this reason, he has plans to change his business, expand his house and build a property where he can rent out rooms. \r\n\r\nThis will Jairo's fourth loan from MFP.

This is 35-year-old Johari J. M. from Dar es Salaam, the married mother of a nine-year-old child. Johari has been running a tailoring business since 2003. \r\n\r\nAt her tailoring business she purchases vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print), and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides) and makes them into clothing mainly for women.  She confided in us that what sets her tailoring business apart is that she is more skilled than others and is able to create different kinds of designs for her customers so they can stand out in a crowd. \r\n\r\nWorking at the business 11 hours per day, 6 days per week, and assisted by her husband, Johari currently earns about $240 per month. She is now requesting a loan of $550 to purchase additional materials required for making clothes. In the future, she plans to carry a greater variety of materials in order to differentiate her products even further.  Johari thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":248916,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Genobeba is pictured here with a sack of rice and another sack of staple food products.  Genobeba sells these items, as well as fuel.  She keeps her fuel supply stored in the community where her son works as a teacher.  This community is located on the Ucayali River one day and one night's travel by boat from Genobeba's home.  Genobeba considers herself to be an active woman and enjoys selling her products, especially in places located outside the city, both along the river or along the highway that joins Pucallpa and the capital, Lima.\r\n\r\nGenobeba is 52 years old and is married with five children, only one of whom is still dependent on her.  Her husband works as a chainsaw operator for the Saenz Company.\r\n\r\nGenobeba has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for about two years and belongs to the communal bank \"Nuevas Amigas\" (New Friends).  She used her very first loan of 300 soles (about $100) to invest in clothing and TVs, all of which were ordered in advance by residents of the town of Tournavista located two hours from Pucallpa.  Genobeba will use this loan of 1,500 soles to invest in two barrels of fuel and in other products which she plans to sell along the river.\r\n\r\nGenobeba's goal is to eventually have a business out of her home; perhaps a restaurant.  Genobeba is happy to be working with Manuela Ramos and appreciates the facility with which the organization gives credit.  Other banks make obtaining loans much more difficult.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

Mutabar is 46 years old. She is married and the loving mother of two adult children. Mutabar has been running her business for about 14 years. She sells clothes for teenagers and men. Her trading place is located in the local market. Mutabar has taken out several loans from IMON and has proven herself as a reliable client. Today she requests $1500 US Dollars. She is planning to enlarge the range of goods she is selling. Mutabar thanks everyone supporting her and promises to manage the loan as accurately as usual.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Both of them are attending school. Duncan is a dedicated farmer from Kipsomba Location in western Kenya, near the town of Kitale. He has been in the farming business for 10 years, selling his milk and maize at the Kenya Cooperative Cremeries and National Cereals and Produce Board respectively. He also earns some income from his large-scale poultry project after resigning from a security firm. \r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan through Juhudi Kilimo for Kshs 36,400 to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

She is called \"morning person\" as she sells her products both wholesale and retail early in the morning in a heavily trafficked market on Tumusla street.  The \"morning people\" are a group of people who, as their name says, sell their goods early in the morning.  They sell their goods wholesale since in most cases, they make their products and only sell until 9 am.  After 9, the owners of the stores arrive and the \"morning people\" have to leave.  \r\n\r\nPaulina only works in the morning but in the afternoon she takes care of her home and cooks for her husband who arrives tired after a long day of being a taxi driver.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by operating a vegetable vending business.  Her husband, Maximo P., who is 63 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 5 children, ages 22 to 34 years old.\r\n\r\nTeodora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teodora has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10000, which she intends to use to purchase a bigger volume of vegetables to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future. She plans to use the profits for house improvements. Teodora P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband Rodney, who is 44 years old, works as a electrician to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have one child who is 13 years old. \r\n\r\nNelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to purchase  feed for her piggery so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. \r\n\r\nNelita O. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

Among her three children, two of them are still at school age.  H. and her husband plant sedges.  After each harvest, they sold the short and not-quite good sedges, and keep the good ones to make sedge mats.  Good materials and Mrs. H.'s cleverness bring beautiful mats, and all of the mats made are sold very quickly at good prices.  After joining TYM Fund, Mrs. H. has more money, so she is able to make more sedge mats.  Each day she makes 4 to 5 sedge mats.  Her income is about 6 USD per day, which is a huge improvement compared to what she earned before joining TYM Fund.  Mrs. H. was able to buy a closet, a T.V. and other furniture for her house.

Malohat is 31 years old. She is married with two children. She started her own business 11 years ago because her husband\u2019s salary was not enough for their family's expenses. Malohat sells confectioneries such as candies, cookies and pastries in the local market.  Her family is living with her husband's parents and the generated income allows Malohat to support her large household. Malohat dreams of her children getting a higher education. \r\n\r\nToday she requests a loan of 3000 Somoni for the term of 12 months. She is going to use the funds to purchase a wider range of confectionery goods.  With the income she plans to buy her own store and educate her children. Malohat thanks everyone for their support and promises to repay the loan on time, as she did with her previous loan.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history.  It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 63 years old and a wife and mother of seven children. \r\nPalm kernel oil is produced from palm kernel. The palm kernel is a by-product of palm oil. The palm kernel is processed through various stages to obtain the palm kernel oil which is used to prepare many local dishes like fried fish and pastries. \r\nGeorgina supplies food vendors for their meal preparation. However, her production is on the low side as a result of too little working capital to afford a processing machine.

She joined ASHI in 1996, wanting to achieve her dream of giving her children a better kind of life and rise above from poverty. Loans she had requested all throughout her membership had been very significant in changing her life and her family\u2019s. Because of them, she has able to have a fishing and fish selling business as a source of her family daily finances as well as giving her husband a livelihood to manage. Anita\u2019s husband is the one that manages the motor fishing boat she purchased through her previous loan from ASHI. She sells the fish in the market. When business capital and profits from the business are larger enough, she purchases a large volume of fish from other fishermen and trades them to other neighboring municipalities. Since she has paid up her previous loan, she requests a much larger amount of loan for the same purpose. Through this, her business will grow and eventually she will accomplish her dream of helping her husband support the needs of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":479271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

He currently lives in the Fuzuli region, an area still under Azerbaijan's jurisdiction. He is married and has two children, ages 13 and 14. His business is a stand from which he sells fruits and vegetables all year.\r\n\r\nSakit is seeking a loan of 2,000 Azerbaijani New Manats to expand his stand so that it would provide shade for his produce. He worries that the vegetables go bad too quickly under the heat of the sun during the summers and freeze during the winters. By building additional shelves on his stand, he could increase the shelf-life of the produce he sells. \r\n\r\nSakit hopes that by keeping his produce fresh longer, he can decrease the number of trips he takes to purchase them at the various bazaars, some of which are located quite a distance away.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":550028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To expand his stand so that it would provide shade for his produce","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Fuzuli region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":30,"posted_date":"2010-06-05T05:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sakit ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":200.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195878369},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:55:07Z","rounded_local_amount":200.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201319612},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":200.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206188984},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":200.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211262549},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":200.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216542487},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":200.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221711005},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:47:44Z","rounded_local_amount":200.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227081373},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":200.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232843044},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:46:20Z","rounded_local_amount":200.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238655079},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":200.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244609129}],"funded_date":"2010-07-01T23:38:43Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:30:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":209817,"name":"Saidjon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"E.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
