Mary sells her music through concerts as well as her website.\r\n\r\nMary has recently received a second loan from ACCION USA to finish producing a series of music videos.  She hopes to break into the large market in East Africa where videos, and not music albums, generate revenue and reach more listeners.  \r\n\r\nShe hopes to reach millions of Swahili speakers in countries like Kenya, Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda.  In addition, she recently noticed that there\u2019s a big market in the United States for her music, that goes beyond the African communities with whom she has close ties.

Pero desde hace 2 a\u00f1os opt\u00f3 por  dedicarse mayormente a la compra y venta de frutas, desde entonces compra su mercader\u00eda directamente de las chacras de los agricultores, con esta modalidad gana mucho m\u00e1s a pesar de tener que pagar el transporte. Teodora est\u00e1 muy contenta con su negocio, ahora tiene mucha m\u00e1s clientela y esto le genera mayores ganancias para mejorar su calidad de vida. Este es su 3er pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, durante los 2 periodos anteriores demostr\u00f3 puntualidad en cada una de sus cuotas. Sus compa\u00f1eros de banco comunal la llaman \u201cla suavecita\u201d, ya que tiene un trato muy sutil e irradia tranquilidad en sus conversaciones. El dinero que viene solicitando lo invertir\u00e1 en el incremento del capital para su negocio de compra y venta de frutas.","en":"Teodora will be 38 years old next month.  She lives with the father of her 4 children in a house they own, a house constructed of wood and covered on the inside by plastic to keep out the cold night air.  She used to help her parents with farm work as a young girl and what she most liked was growing plantains because they don't require a lot of effort and they can be harvested twice a year.  She used to pick and box the plantains on Fridays so they could be transported easily and, on Saturdays, she took them to the market to sell.  The earnings from this work allowed her to pay for her children's schooling.  Two years ago, though, she decided to spend the majority of her time buying and selling fruit.  Since then, she's bought her merchandise directly from local farmers, something that's allowed her to earn more even though she has to pay transportation costs.  Teodora is very happy with her business.  She now has many more customers, her business generates more revenue and she's been able to improve her quality of life.  This is her third MFP loan.  She repaid the installments on the previous two loans on time.  The other members of her community bank call her La Suavecita, \"The Gentlewoman\", because her manner of conversation is so subtle and serene.  The loan will be used to increase capital for the business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":343458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy merchandise to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-26T23:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1522.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992355}],"funded_date":"2009-06-27T02:48:46Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":122535,"name":"Abdukhalil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"F.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To make a living, Nida owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store.

Nida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,000 PHP from GDMPC. Nida is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Nida from GDMPC.

Her previous loan of 9,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,000 PHP, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.\r\n<p> \r\nFor this, her fourth loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase a new computer for her internet caf\u00e9. With the profits she can repair and maintain her equipment and continue to save up for their future. Rosemarie A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p> \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through its alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a dollar a day to achieving realities beyond their dreams. They are on a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon\u2014a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":587740,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

Since he was a child, he has known the art of making decorative bowls (mate burilado); he observed how they were made and then became an expert in making these handicrafts himself.  Today, he makes various designs and sells them in the artisanal centers of the city and other cities.  His workshop is inside his home and he performs his craft with his mother.  Their business is profitable and advantageous for Franz because it gives him free time to study.  He would like to have a larger workshop where he can contract other workers to keep making his art.

His business is selling food such as snacks, corn cakes, pies, 'hallacas' (meat and vegetables in cornmeal dough, wrapped in plantain leaves), and drinks such as soda and beer, from a very smart sales location in Barranquillita.  This is a very busy sector where there are a lot of formal and informal businesses and a number of public markets specialized in selling meat, fish and flowers, and shopping centers which sell clothes, footwear and general accessories.  This is the area where William's business is located.  He has owned his business for two years and it came about because he needed to make income to support his son when he was born.  William had to work from 4.00am to 6.00pm as he still does today.\r\n\r\nWilliam's goal is to receive training from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo so that he can manage his business well and also gather together more working capital so that he can expand his business and grow it by putting in all his effort.\r\n\r\nWilliam's business has recently grown substantially.

He is single and doesn't have any children.  For this reason, he lives in a rental house and works a lot every day so that he can enjoy a better quality of life.  Edgar's job is providing a collective passenger transport service both within the city and outside the city.  He spends his days driving his taxi, working either days or nights.  He drives the streets in search of customers who want to arrive at their destination safe and sound.  He is a cheerful man and his talents as a conversationalist mean that his customers seek him out so that he can give them a ride.  In addition, he knows the streets of the city of Pucallpa very well and always provides a quick service.  At first things were complicated as it was difficult having to drive so much.  However, when he started to see how profitable it was and he got into a rhythm, he managed to grow in his business.\r\n\r\nWhat Edgar most likes about his work is driving through the streets as he really enjoys himself.  He has been in this line of work for two years and what he least likes about it is having to argue with some passengers who don't pay their fare.  He hopes, in the future, to buy another taxi and to work with it so that he can improve his income.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Edgar's second loan from MFP and he is very happy to know that he will have financial support.

Some customers pay as you go by cash while others pay once a month. She has been doing the business for one year. Her profit could get as much as 1,500,000 IDR (1USD ~ 9,000 IDR).

Dia bisa mengambil 5-6 karung, sesuai dengan pesanan. Ada yang langsung membayar; ada juga yang membayarnya sebulan sekali. Usaha ini telah ditekuninya selama setahun. Keuntungan dari usaha ini mencapai Rp 1.500.000,00 per 2 minggu. Apabila dipertimbangkan dengan biaya hidup per hari meraka yang Rp 50.000,00 dan biaya pendidikan anak mereka per bulan yang Rp 100.000,00. Maka akan dibutuhkan Rp 1.600.000,00 per bulannya.

Only eight of the members finished their schooling, the rest of the group sadly learned to read and write only at a very basic level. It has been a dream for them to enroll in a school for adults to finish their education but at the moment they lack the necessary resources to do it. The majority of the members are mainly dedicated to the sale of fruits and vegetables on the distinct city streets of El Alto. With winter here, the prices for these products tend to rise as a result of frosts on the plantations. It's for this reason they needed to reinforce their capital to acquire their goods, which they do every two weeks. They also want to be able to rent or buy sales posts in the city markets to ensure their sales and better preserve their products. In this way they'll be able to increase their earnings and be able to afford going to school and give their families a better quality of life.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein,

Her business is located outside of her house in an area that is fixed up well.  Little by little, she has made herself known among her customers, and she tells us that today this kind of business is going very well for her.  She sells every day starting at 6:00 in the evening.  She has had this business for one year, and she is very happy with what she does.  With this loan of 1,000 PEN, she will buy supplies such as rice in sacks, eggs, chickens for her \"juanes\" (a local dish made of chicken, rice, olives, and eggs wrapped in a leaf), and gutted chickens for her kebabs.

Garc\u00eda  is 20 years old, single and lives with his mother Carmela Garc\u00eda who is 65 years old. He supports his mother through his work, his father passed away 20 years ago from an unknown illness. Juan produces potato and pumpkin. He has experience in cultivation and plant health treatments. He buys his agricultural supplies from the market at Colomi - potato seed, pumpkin seed and agrichemicals.\r\n \r\nJuan lives in the Corani zone 35km from Colomi, in the Chapare province of Cochabamba. This zone is quite remote from the city and therefore it is difficult for them to go to the banks for a loan. This is why Cidre had the initiative to go to this zone. On the zone visit they saw that the construction of his house is very unstable, but the zone is very suitable for growing potato and pumpkin.\r\n\r\nJuan tells us that his greatest dream is to continue producing potato and pumpkin, to increase the crop and with the profits build a suitable house and fulfill his mother's dreams of having her own home. Juan is thinking of having a family and therefore needs to have his own home in the best condition possible.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":452678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of supplies for growing Potato and Pumpkin","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2009-12-20T00:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144689266},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182523242},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:53:27Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211200936},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244534880}],"funded_date":"2009-12-20T12:23:16Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:35:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catherine Dent","image":null}},{"id":167898,"name":"Ari Mpya Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muslima A., age 42, is married.

Ampalaya, Brgy. Gun-ob, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu City. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and pig fattening. Her husband Angelo P., who is 25 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living. They have a 5-year-old child.  \r\n\r\nGeraldine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Geraldine has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 25,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use for the expansion of her pig-fattening business and to purchase a second-hand motorcycle so that she can continue to save up for the future, improve their house and expand their business. Geraldine P. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.   \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Baybay, Brgy. Villa Paz, El Nido, Palawan. She earns her living by operating a furniture business.  Her husband Benito D., Jr., who is 46 years old, works as a furniture maker to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 6 children who are 12 to 24 years old. Rosela joined NWTF- Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF- Project Dungganon, Rosela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 3rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase additional materials so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and for the family. Rosela D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Since she was a little girl her parents taught her how to work the fields.  Paulina is a farmer and she has four hectares of land where she grows bamboo, cocoa beans, coca leaves and barbasco (a plant from which progesterone is synthesized), which are plants native to the jungle in the Apurimac River Valley.\r\n\r\nShe has been working her land for 23 years and she still enjoys the work, most of all harvesting, because that\u2019s when she feels that the months of hard work are being rewarded and she sees that her harvest is composed of high quality products.  However, it is difficult to transport her crops from her fields to the city of San Francisco which is where the best prices are offered for her grains and coca leaves.\r\n\r\nIn the future she wants to buy new fields to increase her crops.  This is her 9th loan with MFP and she knows that if she repays on time she will be eligible for future loans more easily as well as not cause problems for her communal bank.

He is married and has two children. He is a responsible person who takes care of his family.  His wife is not working because she is looking after their children.  \r\n\r\nKiyomidin is engaged in animal husbandry. He has been in this business for 10 years.

Kiyomidin would like to get a loan of 7000 Somoni to purchase additional cattle and expand his business.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For some time now, she has learned to cope with the arduous responsibility entailed by the education of her three children.  With the goal of bettering the quality of her family's life, she started a small business selling wallets and briefcases in which she places all of her efforts.  Nonetheless, she still has many limitations to fully develop this activity because of numerous orders she has taken and not been able to fulfill due to lack of capital.  For that reason, she hopes to increase her inventory to cover a variety of orders, and rent a space to offer them in a permanent fashion.  By expanding her business, she will have greater returns that will allow her to efficiently contribute the unconditional support that she provides her little ones.

Even in the tough economic situation, Johari can survive it because he has skill in building raft so he is now making use of this skill. Furthermore, currently quite many people need rafts so his business can go well. Johari started the business with the initial capital of Rp. 500,000, however, since the business has become bigger, it is not enough for buying the raw materials (bamboo). Moreover, the price of bamboo is increasing because of its high demand. When he can't buy bamboo, he orders raft from Jawa, then he modifies the size as requested by his customers in Bali. Fortunately, Dinari foundation is willing to give him a loan so that Johari can continue the business. This business is his only source of income, while his wife is a full-time housewife who doesn't earn money at all. A raft made of bamboo skin can be sold for Rp. 450,000, and a raft made of bamboo can be sold for Rp. 300,000. With the loan from Dinari, Johan hopes that his business can grow and he can earn more profit so that he can afford his children's education fee and his family's life expenses.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nJohari seorang bapak yang sangat bertanggung jawab terhadap kehidupan keluarganya. Dalam menghadapi situasi ekonomi seperti ini Johari tetap bisa bertahan karena ia memiliki ketrampilan dibidang menganyam bedeg,sehingga ketrampilan itu sekarang dikembangkan. Apalagi sekarang ini yang memerlukan bedek lumayan banyak sehingga usaha ini bisa dikembangkan terus. Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp.500.000 Johari menekuni usaha ini, namun sejalan dengan berkembangnya usaha ini dan banyak yang mulai mengenal hasil anyaman Johari maka modal awal tidak lagi mencukupi untuk membeli bahan baku yaitu bambu. Apalagi sekarang harga bambu mulai meningkat ,karena banyaknya yang mencari,sehingga kesempatan bagi pemilik bambu untuk bisa menaikan harga . Dan kalau tidak dapat membeli bambu maka Johari akan mendatangkan bedek yang sudah jadi dari Jawa,kemudian sampai di Bali bedeg tersebut disambung sesuai dengan ukuran yang diminta oleh si pemesan.Untungnya ada Yayasan Dinari yang memberikan pinjaman modal ,sehingga Johari bisa tetap meneruskan usaha ini. Karena usaha inilah satu-satunya  matapencaharian bagi Johari dan keluarga,sedangkan istrinya tidak mempunyai pekerjaan yang bisa menunjang keuangan keluarga. Satu lembar bedeg yang terbuat dari kulit bambu bisa dijual seharga Rp.450.000, sedangkan kalau bedeg yang terbuat dari bambu bagian dalam hanya bisa terjual seharga Rp.300.000. Dengan modal pinjaman dari Dinari Johari berharap usahanya dapat terus berjalan dan berkembang dan keuntungan yang diperoleh pun bisa meningkat sehingga anak-anaknya dapat bersekolah dan kehidupan keluarga dapat terjamin."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":150323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 43 years old and lives with her common-law husband. She has five children between the ages of 13 and 25. They are all in school except the middle daughter, who is already employed in education.\r\n\r\nMafalda and her father left Gaza for the town of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland while she was still a child. Her father worked at the Montemor mineral water company, and died on the job. The company then hired one of his children, and since she was the eldest she had the opportunity to work to help support her family. Today she has been an employee there for 24 years, alternating between a day shift from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and a night shift from 3:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. She earns 2129 meticals a month, not enough to cover her basic expenses, since she lives in a rental house that costs 500 meticals a month. But with the help of her husband, who works as a border guard, they manage to scrape by. Because of the high cost of construction materials they have not been able to finish building their house. Her husband had to apply for a 34,000-metical loan from a bank (BIM) to continue the work, and it still remains unfinished. She learned about our services in a conversation with coworkers, and came to us to request a loan of 10,000 meticals to finish part of the house and be able to move into their own home. Apart from her children, she is not financially responsible for anybody else. She has big dreams of getting married officially and being\r\n\r\nThis is Mafalda's first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. She will use these 10,000 meticals to buy door frames and windows and their respective locks. She's very happy, since soon she will be living in her own home. She's confident that she will pay off the loan early and request another one to pay for preparations for her future wedding.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva

Three of their children are currently going to school and also help in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nAlma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in fish vending. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nAlma is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 40,000 was used to fund the operations of her fish vending business, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 13th cycle loan in the amount of PHP 40,000, which she intends to also use for her fish vending business. Alma is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, such as providing them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Her business, which she has had for several years, is a mini-market.  It has been her source of income.  She has been working in sales for many years.  \r\n\r\nThe most difficult part is being able to maintain equilibrium because sales go down and the products rise.  But, thanks to the loans she has been able to maintain her inventory.  When she started she was a young woman.

He operates a barber shop in an area known as Maasai Lodge in the region of Ongata Rongai. The area is densely populated and his customers are mostly the local residents in the area. He has been running this business for five years and has hired two employees.

He spends his time fishing at night and driving a pedicab during the day. Because of Marito's strong desire to see his children finish their studies, along with his wish to quit renting a house and purchase a small home of his own, HSPFI is helping him fulfill his dreams through HSPFI savings and loans.

Don Jorge buys the stale bread that is left over from his wife's work each day, which are collected and wrapped in bags and left to harden. Once there are a few bags of hardened bread, Don Jorge buys them and afterwards carries them back home to grind in a small grinding machine. Later, he sells the crumbs by the hundredweight and pound. Don Jorge is a very reponsible person towards his job and his family.

She sells fruits, sweets, preserved food, juices, soft drinks and many other items in her grocery. \r\n\r\nThe inventory she has for sale is of very good quality and selection. Zebiniso is respectful and patient with all of her customers, which attracts people and brings them back to her vending facility to buy groceries again. \r\n\r\nZebiniso is seeking to keep her business sustainable and has requested a loan of $3,000 to increase the inventory she has for sale.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is originally from Ccatca but currently lives in Huambutio. She has three children; one is already grown and independent, and the other two still depend on her. Alejandrina and her husband Aniceto both help each other at home, and they also have a family business making ceramic tiles.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures, a general store and a fish vending business. Her husband Renaldo C., who is 55 years old, works as a tailor to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 20 and 30 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Zosima joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $188, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing 17,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more stock that she can sell to customers so that she can continue to save up for future improvements in her business. Ma. Zosima C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The official name of this borrowing group is Lilian B..\r\n\r\nLilian is single. To make a living, Lilian owns & operates a business catching and selling fresh-water fish at the market.

Lilian is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Lilian from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

She offers her customers snacks, <i>tlacoyos<\/i> [oval-shaped fried or toasted cakes made from corn dough], rice tacos, brisket taquitos, flautas, chicken quesadillas, enchiladas, tostadas, <i>pozole<\/i> [traditional stew], and golden tacos.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Very soon she began to fan out to surrounding communities focusing on the quality of her products and good prices.\r\n\r\nToday she wants to expand even more and has chosen the month of December, because not only are the hayacas purchased for resale, but also for immediate consumption, so this is just what she will accomplish, the sales will increase and so will her growth.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to increase her profit in order to be able to continue supporting her daughter and paying for the professional studies that she will begin in 2012. At this time she is asking for a Kiva loan, her first loan that will be made through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy raw materials and supplies in greater volume, in order to obtain discounts, and also to buy a chopper with which to prepare hayacas in a more effective way, and to meet the requests of her clients during these Happy New Year celebrations where everyone shares food and abundance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":925666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lives with her 40-year old husband Ricardo and together their goal is to get ahead in life. She lives in her parents\u2019 house but is in the process of buying a place of her own.\r\n\r\nMargarita earns her living by renting out her 4-wheeled vehicle. After a long time she had saved enough money to buy the car she had longed for. Now she runs it as a colectivo (shared taxi) in the town of Pucallpa. As a result her income has increased; beforehand she didn\u2019t earn much money from the casual work she was doing.\r\n\r\nMargarita really enjoys being the owner of a taxi as she can travel constantly and enjoy the countryside. She\u2019s been doing this work for three years. The most difficult part for her is getting up very early in the morning in order to keep to the schedule. While the work is hard, she knows that in the long-term it will bring positive results.\r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to buy another vehicle and continue to make progress. This will be her seventh loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she has financial support to keep expanding her business. With the S\/.1000 Margarita is seeking, she will buy spare parts and send her vehicle to the garage for its regular inspection.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":953538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"buy spare parts and have her vehicle serviced","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-21T16:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":151.02},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":159.36},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":171.22},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":177.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":182.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.76},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.63,"local_amount":151.02,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":152.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836358},{"amount":59.76,"local_amount":159.36,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":161.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246139},{"amount":59.53,"local_amount":158.75,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":160.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386155},{"amount":64.21,"local_amount":171.22,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":173.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099249},{"amount":66.6,"local_amount":177.6,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":179.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713396},{"amount":68.27,"local_amount":182.05,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":184.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202285}],"funded_date":"2011-12-23T04:47:18Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":377520,"name":"Tsogzolmaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tsogzolmaa is a 49-year-old widow who lives with her three children, ages 15 to 29.

Mrs. D., an ingenious woman, has put all of her know-how into her work and the idea of good hygiene, which means that everyone likes to eat in her restaurant.\r\n\r\nWith such a large clientele, Mrs. D. cannot satsify everyone with her meager resources. That is why she is asking for a $500 credit to update the restaurant and build up a stock of the ingredients she uses in her business. This will increase her income and improve the living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Lisa Molle, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMadame D.

Most of these women either own a weaving business or a daily consumption store. The women of this group know one and other quite well from their San Juan La Laguna community and expressed determination to prove themselves to their families, their group members, and their microlenders. They were content with being part of a community of \u201cunited women without envy of each other\u201d as Cecilia C. V. put it. \r\n<P>There was consensus that the loans were going to be easy to repay. These loans would allow them primarily to invest in their business for higher future profit. Most women in the weaving industry create guipiles and cortes, the traditional indigenous outfits, to sell in the upcoming June 23rd town fair. Seven of them needed funds to invest in their stores which they hoped to set up near the fair. With more products to sell at once, their profits can be much larger during the peak sales of the festive season. They organized this meeting early precisely because of their hopes to receive their loans before the fair. \r\n<P>Melchora Isabel C. owns a traditional clothing store which focuses on sales to tourists. Thanks to her credit, she has been able to produce enough textiles to sell to an intermediary American friend, who exports to the USA. She hires friends to maintain her production rate and allow her time to continue to study in hopes of achieving the equivalent of a high-school degree. \r\n<P>She, along with five others of this new group, stood out as confident role models who began six years ago with loans of 40 USD and are now receiving loans of up to 400 USD. Most of them are in leadership positions such as group president or secretary. Iris Yolanda I. began without any business whatsoever, and is now the proud owner and manager of a crafts and textile business. Cecilia C. now travels to well-known Antigua, Guatemala, to sell the hammocks she makes in large amounts with the help of the loans. \r\n<P>The primary vision that these dedicated businesswomen share is to provide their children with the clothing, food, and education necessary for them to \u201chave it better off than they did as children\u201d and to go on into their adult life with a head start, as Cecilia C. expressed. Alicia C. Y. emphasized the need for this type of individual effort aided by the loans to collectively help their entire town, region, and soon country, prosper."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4850,"image":{"id":171969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Wholesale purchase of market items.

After the rice farming season, she grows green beans to sell for another source of income and now the crop is growing but she faces difficulty getting water to supply her crop.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her own house and what she wants most is to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe works in the purchase and sale of used cars.  Even though she is aware that this work is dominated by men, she does not let them overlook her and she does very good sales now that she has enough knowledge about automobiles and is a very reputable seller, something that has made her clients trust her.  What she likes best about her work is talking with her customers and advising them about the car that best suits them.  She has been in this business for 10 years and what she finds most difficult is having to spend the whole day in search of a buyer.  For the future she hopes to increase her business and have more cars to sell.\r\n\r\nThis is Mercedes' third loan with MFP and she knows to pay it on time if she wants to receive other loans.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Maria has 3 years of experience in this business.  Maria needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maria joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Maria's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Maria T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Don Rogelio lleva 4 a\u00f1os con este negocio por eso comenta que pasa por vaR. desafios como transportar el producto en una camionetita y hacer el gasto diario de gasolina, tambien como la camioneta se usa diario y son distancias grandes las recorre se tiene que hacer el servico seguido de la camioneta y hacer vaR. cambios, otro desafio que encuantra es que los precios suben y el tiene que dar un puco mas caro, si esto pasa don Rogelio sale perdiendo ya que sus clientes le reclaman porque volvio a subir y a el no le conviene porque va perdiendo clientes y los gastos que el hace con su camioneta sigen siendo los mismos \u00f3 mas caro, Don Rogelio dice; \"el prestamo me va beneficiar por medio de los ingresos que vaya teniendo por medio de las ganancias de cada producto que se venda, de esta manera yo pueda mantener a mi familia\" mis metas son engrandecer el negocio hasta poner un local para evitar tantos viajes, como tambien saber elaborar el producto, ya que compro el producto echo, pero no se como prepararlo y que tantas cosas sirven para hacerlo, Don Rogelio tiene 3 hijos, el peque\u00f1o es un ni\u00f1o de tres a\u00f1os, los dos mas grandes estudian la escuela primaria y la secundaria, don Rogelio vive en union libre hace ya 14 a\u00f1os y de edad tiene 46 a\u00f1os, vive en casa propia y su esposa es ama de casa, Los demas compa\u00f1eros de don Rogelio son comerciantes tambien y sus negocios son los siguientes;\n1.-Elidia, tiene un tienda de abarrotes\n2.-Sonia, cria pollos y guajolotes y productos de belleza\n3.-Anastacio, vende frituras chcharrones de cuadro\n4.-Ma Agustina, vende ropa de segunda mano\n5.-Natalia, vende pollos y verdura\n6.-Georgina, tiene un taqueria\n7.-Lilia vende Jarceria.

There are 8 members in the group and they live close to each other. They have known each other for many years and they all trust each other. As a group, they say that they have called themselves by this name because all the names they came up with were already taken, and they liked their chosen name best. The 8 members all run businesses, as is the case with Se\u00f1or Rogelio who runs a business selling cleaning products: 'Suavitel' for laundry, along with 'Clarasol' and 'Fabuloso' for cleaning floors and other surfaces in the home.\r\nDon Rogelio has run this business for 4 years and he tells us that he has faced many challenges, such as transporting the products in his little van; having to pay daily for gas; also as he uses the van daily for travelling long distances he has to take the van for services and pay for maintenance. Another challenge comes from rising costs which means he would have to sell his products at a higher price. If this happens, Don Rogelio ends up operating at a loss as he does not pass on these price rises to his clients. If he keeps on increasing his prices then he will lose his clients, and the costs that he must pay for his van continue to be the same or higher. Don Rogelio says, 'the loan is going to improve the income I receive from the sale of each product, and so I will be able to provide for my family'. His goals are to increase the size of his business until he has his own shop, so that he will not have to make so many journeys, as well as learning how to make the product, as he currently buys the product ready made but does not know how to prepare it and many items are needed to make it. \r\n\r\nDon Rogelio is 46 years old and has three children. The youngest is three years old and his two older children are at primary and secondary school respectively. Don Rogelio has been with his partner for 14 years, they live in their own home and his partner is a housewife. The other members in Don Rogelios group are also businesspeople, and their businesses are as follows:   \r\n\r\n1.-Elidia, runs a general store\r\n2.-Sonia, raises chickens and turkeys and sells beauty products\r\n3.-Anastacio, sells fried snacks\r\n4.-Ma Agustina, sells second hand clothes\r\n5.-Natalia, sells chicken and vegetables\r\n6.-Georgina, sells tacos\r\n7.-Lilia sells domestic products.

concrete.  \r\n\r\nShe is grateful for the support Afodenic, though Kiva funds, provides because without that support it would be impossible for her to make her dream of turning her little house into
