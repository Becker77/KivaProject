He is the father of four children. His main work consists of breeding cattle. This very remunerative activity enables him to provide for the needs of his family. \r\n\r\nA very ambitious man, Akmaljon would like to buy a greater number of cattle and to build a barn in which to house them, in order to ensure their safety. Due to a lack of finances, he is asking for a loan of $1,500 USD for the realization of this project. When his dream is carried out, Akmaljon will be able to have a greater source of revenue for his growing family. With your help, this will be possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 45 years old and lives in her own home with her three teenage children and her husband Pedro (age 46).\r\n<p>\r\nFor ten years, Ana and her husband have been dedicated to farming.  Unfortunately, her husband was in an accident two years ago in which he injured his left leg to the point that he is no longer able to walk.  This situation made her work harder along with her oldest son because she did not want her family to lack anything, much less give up basic necessities.  \u201cMy son is essentially, for the sake of his siblings and his father, the man of the house.  This has not affected me so much as it does my husband, since he is not able to work.  Heber (her son) is very responsible and I am very proud of him,\u201d says Ana.  Every day, mother and child leave at 4am to head toward their farmland.  They have hired workers since they always like to see their land cleared because it ensures a good harvest.  Ana believes they have done well in their farming activities because they always plant in large numbers to obtain a more productive harvest.  She also plans to reopen her grocery store, which she had to close because she had to pay workers to help with fumigating their crops.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  Ana is happy to be working with her Communal Bank because at each meeting she learns how to confront different situations that are encountered as a part of daily life, thanks to the educational seminars that have been provided.  With the money she requested, Ana will be able to save enough money to purchase products that are needed to reopen her grocery store, especially sodas since they are the most profitable.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":507567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase merchandise so that she can reopen her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-17T18:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1551.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153899}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T20:45:26Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":189429,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is 28 years old and married to Monicah Wairimu.

This group is made up of young members who have the desire to get ahead and expand their businesses. Juan Oscar is single, and he has just finished his studies in the field of Odontology. He wants to open his own clinic and also continue specialized studies. He needs the loan in order to open his clinic, so he can work and pay for his night classes. The other members work in a range of fields, such as making and selling pastries; selling cosmetics and clothing from a catalog; selling books or CDs; or serving customers in a liquor store. Others work in public relations, in spite of their young age. Despite the fact that there is heavy competition in all of these fields, the members know where to go, how to make contacts, and what seasons are best for each product; in short, they have a lot of experience. Some of the members will use the loan to buy specialized books; others will buy merchandise; and the publicist will use it for a video recorder. The greatest expectation shared by this group of young people is to be able to finish their studies, because many of them are working full-time in their careers due to their need to support themselves. Some of these members have worked in the past with other financial institutions, and some have worked with our institution in the past. In spite of being young, they want to get ahead, expand their businesses and become better every day. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing transportation services to local community members. Heide has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Heide joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Heide has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. Heide is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Heide from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They live in a neighborhood in the central mountains of Peru.  Since she was very small she always watched her parents working the land and preparing months ahead for the harvest season.  She learned everything she needed to know about agricultural techniques which she has put to use on her own land where she grows potatos, peas and lima beans. \r\n\r\nShe says she enjoys her work because she shares it with her husband.

She added that on weekends she also sells Mexican snacks at night like tostadas, pozole (hominy soup), tacos dorados (deep fried tacos), enchiladas, etc. Do\u00f1a Lupita\u2019s goal is to set up a stand selling Mexican snacks everyday outside a primary school  in order to earn a little more income. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":822706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to sell homemade tortillas.\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-13T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":213.32},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":227.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.07},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":237.08},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":242.19},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":247.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":252.76},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":258.21},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":263.78},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":269.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":275.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":281.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.61},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.07},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.52},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.98},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.45},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.94},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.05,"local_amount":672.58,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":674.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201928},{"amount":39.94,"local_amount":479.25,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":480.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807520},{"amount":41.68,"local_amount":500.18,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:23:13Z","rounded_local_amount":501.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618614},{"amount":43.5,"local_amount":521.99,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":523.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572857},{"amount":45.39,"local_amount":544.76,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":546.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784643},{"amount":23.44,"local_amount":281.24,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:22Z","rounded_local_amount":282.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193333}],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T20:19:53Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":328757,"name":"Betty Beatriz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Betty es socia del  Banco Comunal \u201cMujeres al Progreso de Juli\u201d, ubicado en el distrito de Juli, provincia Chucuito, departamento de Puno, tiene 17 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente y tiene un hijo.

Maria and Saul adopted a little girl named Marsella from her relatives. Marsella, who is 10, is studying at the 3rd grade in Elementary School. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet their family needs, Maria\u2019s husband runs an electronics (e.g. television, radio, tape recorder etc) repair shop business. As the income generated from the business is unstable, Maria took the initiative to sell gasoline in front of her house to support her husband in meeting their family needs. She has been running the business for almost five years. \r\n\r\nMaria intends to add more gasoline for her business after she saw the opportunity to serve people who do not have time to stand in line at the gasoline station, particularly in the morning when they should go to work and school. It would allow her business product to be sold out quickly. \r\n\r\nThis situation led her to seek a loan of IDR 3,000,000 from TLM. She plans to purchase more gasoline to sell. She hopes that TLM will assist her in improving her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

She is married to a mechanic & businessman, and has 3 children, aged 13 years, 4 years, and 4 months.  Two of her children are going to school.   \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Wulaymatu established her business selling baby diapers, pants, towels, babywear and wrappers.  She began her business because when her father died she was brought up by her stepmother who did not think it wise to see her through school.  She taught herself this business, which has been her source of income ever since.  Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,961,000 every month from her business. \r\n\r\nWulaymatu would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000.  She has already received and successfully repaid 1 previous loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy children's jeans (2 dozens @ Le400,000), jeans skirts (2 dozen @ Le450,000), babywear (4 dozen @ Le250,000),  and blouses (3 dozens @ Le300,000).  The balance of 400,000 will be used for transport and other costs.   She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 490,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Wulaymatu plans to open a well-secured shop where she can display her large stock.  She also wants to build a house and give her children a good education. She hopes to access more help in terms of loans for her business, as it is her only source of generating income.  The rain  is a major factor for her because her stall is not well covered.  The competition is high, but she always has a regular supply of goods that customers demand.  She serves people around the town, about 20 per day.  She treats her customers fairly and respects their wishes.

She has sold vegetables for ten years at a market in the center of the city where she lives.  Each morning she loads the merchandise to take to the market with her husbands help.  Then she works all day offering her products while treating people well.  Good quality vegetables at a fair price is what guarantees that her customers return.  Vilma presents her products nicely since her sales depend on it.  She is very happy with the rhythm of work because this business is a pillar that her house stands on.  Later on Vilma would like to have a large stall of her own at the market where she could offer all types and varieties of vegetables.  This is the second time she has had a loan with MFP (Microfinanzas Prisma).  She is very thankful to be part of her community bank because it\u2019s a place to grow personally and professionally.  She is committed to continue working for the common good.  Vilma is applying for this loan to purchase more vegetables at wholesale and partly to pay for transportation to the market.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Haynes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":305435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-20T21:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":97.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":106.65},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":111.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":114.81},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":120.15},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":127.04},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":131.64},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":138.68},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":143.53},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":151.37},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":156.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.27},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.35},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.58,"local_amount":97.75,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":101.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012459},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:21Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596049},{"amount":35.55,"local_amount":106.65,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":110.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990313},{"amount":37.15,"local_amount":111.45,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":115.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211436},{"amount":38.27,"local_amount":114.81,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":118.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640947},{"amount":40.05,"local_amount":120.15,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":124.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080415},{"amount":42.35,"local_amount":127.04,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":131.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996594},{"amount":43.88,"local_amount":131.64,"processed_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":136.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842112},{"amount":196.84,"local_amount":590.51,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":611.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733788}],"funded_date":"2009-04-21T02:51:22Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sue Haynes","image":null}},{"id":106651,"name":"Oum","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oum S. is 43 years old and resides in the Kampong Cham province.

He has four children.  All of them asked to be in the photo with the exception of his oldest daughter; she was embarrassed.  Once Jose Luis became a widower he moved to live in a house that was given to him by his ex in-laws.  This is because two of his children are from his first marriage.  When his wife was alive she managed a place where she sold food.  It was set up in his own home.  Now, given the circumstances, Jose Luis saw that it would be convenient to set up a bar in a strategic area of the city.\r\n\r\nJose Luis currently lives with Magali.  They have two children.  Jose Luis is very hard-working, and they are very hopeful that his new business will be successful.  The good thing is that there is no competition nearby, and there are lots of shops and stores that are close.  They hope these people from these places will be their customers.  \r\n\r\nThe loan he asked for was to buy a jukebox, but it was not enough.

M., sociologist, single mother, 1 son, member of the community bank \"Mujeres Emprendedoras-Sa\u00f1os GranD.\".\r\nIsabel V. is a sociologist by profession and she practiced this career for a number of years. She had her only son when she was 35, and she has to raise and educate him alone as the father of her child lost interest in them and started another home. \r\nShe used to work all day and her son was looked after by a babysitter. As her son got older, he would always ask for his father despite the fact that she tried to give him all the affection he needed. But that was enough, though the affection of a father can't be replaced, and certainly not with material things. \r\nWhen one of her sisters passed away, her grief was devastating and she hadn't the strength to do anything; they had been very close. This sister had left her some properties but, unfortunately, her other sisters took everything and only left her with two little rooms to live in. She did not claim anything else because it did not seem right to her to fight with her sisters. \r\nSubsequently, she stopped working and lived only on the pension that she received. But, she had her small son in her care and he was of school age and the money did not stretch far enough. At that time, one of her sisters had a small store where she rented out dresses and suits, but this sister got the opportunity to work abroad and closed the store. Then the idea occurred to Isabel that she could reopen this store and have a bazaar, as her sister had left behind some rentable garments, cloth, and other things. So, Isabel maD. and bought more dresses, and in this way she began her business and it has been going well to date. Her wish is that the business will grow and she can expand it. \r\n(In the photo, Isabel V. is in the upper left.) \r\nShe will use the loan for business capital. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":657719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Business capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-12-05T00:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad Chabeli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesica Magali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dosmila Erma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabi Isela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":705}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":249.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":249.65},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.64},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":249.64,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665403},{"amount":249.65,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408654},{"amount":249.64,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826945},{"amount":249.64,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201269206},{"amount":249.64,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206136086},{"amount":251.79,"local_amount":705,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":711.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211208585}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T16:12:34Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:58:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":259103,"name":"Lilibeth's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilibeth A. is from the village of Union, Cauayan City, Isabela.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, snack foods, milk, beverages, and food seasonings in the local community. Marcelina has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marcelina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marcelina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. Marcelina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods, snack foods, and beverages to sell. This loan will be Marcelin'a third loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

However, she does not lose heart as she has other sources of income such as her five cows which provide her with the milk she needs to make delicious cheese.  She tells us that she makes, on average, 6 molds of cheese each day.  She also has two bulls which help her plow the land, five sheep which she fattens and then later sells, and a grocery store which she set up in her home and where she sells basic household products.  All of this makes her a tenacious woman who has a great desire to get ahead in life.

He is married to a trader and has five children, ages 17, 15, 13, 11 and 2 years. After fifth form, he wanted to enter college but, unfortunately for him, his father died and he had nobody to support his schooling. Therefore, he was left with no other option but to go into business so that he could earn a living. \r\n\r\nIn 1994, Osman established a business selling shirts, shorts, T-shirts, sneakers and shoes for both men and women. He is assisted by his distant cousin. Competition is high but he buys quality goods. He usually goes to Conakry twice per month by public vehicle. He serves people around town and his business is popular as his goods are always available when his customers need them. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about 2,742,000 leones (SLL) every month from this business. Rise in foreign exchange is one of his major problems. \r\n\r\nOsman would like a loan of 4,000,000 SLL. He requires a loan to buy jeans (50 pairs @ 47,000 SLL) and T-shirts (50 @ 24,000 SLL). The balance of 450,000 SLL is for transport.

She started her first business 5 years ago selling frozen popsicles and then worked in a dining room where she cooked for the members and for private parties.  In time she decided to put her business in her house where she now sells her dishes and has many clients.  With the profits she obtained she has managed to buy the utensils and pots for her business that she runs in her residence.  With the first loan of 300 soles that she received from her Communal Bank, called \"The Auroras in Action II\", she invested in the purchase of supplies for the preparation of popsicles.  With the loan of 500 soles, that will be repaid in 4 months, she will invest n the purchase of basic supplies for the sale of her dishes.

Democratic principles have governed Burma\u2019s family for a long time, i.e. Burma and her husband gave their children the freedom to choose their career and future, having previously given them good upbringing and education.  Oldest daughters left to work in Bishkek.  The son is currently attending a university.  The oldest daughter became a designer.  The second daughter followed her father\u2019s footsteps and became a teacher.  The third daughter is temporarily unemployed.  Meanwhile, Burma stayed at home to take care of the household.  Her husband and she have been setting money aside for many years and were able to buy a cow.  Since then, Burma has been involved in animal husbandry and selling milk.  Burma earns three thousand som ($60) in one month.  Burma decided to request a loan in order to purchase and keep one more bull.  Burma is now worried about her daughters.  She hopes to marry them off, build a new house and barn for the livestock next to her home.\r\n <p>\r\nBurma has three partners in this group:\r\n<p>\r\nLazzat T. is twenty-eight years old.

For Mirzorahmad, agriculture is an activity that he likes to do. Within it, vegetable production is what he likes most as it is easier to cultivate these plants and the product is profitable in season, which is annually. But the earnings are greater and beneficial for every farmer, especially when buyers purchase the product in great quantities and the expense of transporting the products is avoided as the buyers come to harvest and take them away themselves. Now Mirzorahmad wishes to borrow money, which he wants to invest in seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. He is sincerely grateful to all of you.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She joined One Acre Fund in order to ensure food security for her family and later educate her children. In the recent 2011 season, Everlyne had a good maize yield harvesting 8 bags on half an acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Everlyne was only able to harvest 2 bags of maize on half an acre of land.\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Everlyne and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit, and insurance.\r\nWith income from maize sales, Everlyne will build a house and invest in livestock rearing. In 2012, the members of Mwanzo B group will each plant maize plots between half and 1 acre of land.\r\nEverlyne is pictured with her group members, with their Field Officer, Ben, on the far left.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":917526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-18T12:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorothy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ambrose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":59500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":59500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:03Z","rounded_local_amount":60645,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680759}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T16:10:19Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":361600,"name":"Olimjon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0438- \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0438\u0445 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 5 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435. \u041e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435 \u043a\u0438\u0448\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0438\u0445 \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 15-20 \u0434\u043d\u0435\u0439. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f  \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u043c  \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0443\u044e \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0443, \u043e\u0442  \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u044c. \u041e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0441 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430. \u041e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438\u0435.","en":"Olimjon started his business with buying and selling livestock and fattening it up.

The main source of income for Mansur's family is animal breeding, which he began in 2007 after a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\". Thanks to Mansur's persistence and perseverance, he currently has one dairy cow and 28 sheep on his farm, and also a harvest of 500 kilos of cotton for sale. \r\n\r\nIn order to further increase the number of livestock, Mansur turned to the company \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of cattle for fattening. Mansur plans to invest the income from the loan to further increase the number of livestock, and in the future provide education for his children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":955385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Nooken district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-21T20:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mansur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":653.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":871.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":653.57,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":30385.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095401},{"amount":871.43,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":40514.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070944}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T22:55:23Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":382085,"name":"Benigna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Benigna  es una cliente antigua de la instituci\u00f3n,  es una persona responsable y emprendedora tiene una tienda de barrio-ferreter\u00eda la cual esta ubicada en la zona de Mar\u00eda auxiliadora, en su mismo domicilio que es casa propia, tambi\u00e9n vende comida por las ma\u00f1anas en la misma zona en la parada de trufis,  su familia esta conformada por  su hija que se encuentra estudiando, La Sra.

Each month from husbandary Wayan Astiti could earn Rp 500,000 (about $55). That is why  Wayan Astiti dare to borrow from Dinari for Rp1,700,000 (about $187). This capital will be used to buy rice shell clippings, wheat shell clippings and tofu leftovers. Since tofu leftovers is good for pregnant mother pig, Wayan Astiti is persistent in learning how to raise pigs. Wayan Astiti wish is that her pregnant mother pig could bore plenty and healthy piglets.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSebagai Seorang ibu rumah tangga yang baik Wayan Astiti tidak bisa berpangku tangan saja.

It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":183098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of rice, beans and vegetables in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-07-21T06:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Halima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-04T19:32:04Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-09-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":40796,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":316209},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-10-04T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-15T07:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":40796,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347883},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":40796,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347867},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":40796,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970439},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":40796,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886656},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":40796,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435919},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:51Z","rounded_local_amount":40796,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130224},{"amount":34.99,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:29Z","rounded_local_amount":40796,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027057},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:04Z","rounded_local_amount":40796,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613097},{"amount":35.01,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:16Z","rounded_local_amount":40795.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010180}],"funded_date":"2008-07-21T19:32:04Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":61608,"name":"Maria Eugenia","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Eugenia is 22 years old and is single.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is good that Flor's two younger children are only seven and eight years old and yet in primary school. Expenses are somehow too much for Flor and her husband to bear. \r\n<p>\r\nFlor and her husband have been in a rice farming business since they started their own family. The land they use for that business is rented from someone in their village. Before Flor became a member of ASHI, the only capital she had to finance her business was borrowed from wealthy people in their village. The owner of the land takes a percentage from their harvest, and so did the person who lent them money. At the end of the day, all that is left for Flor and her family is just enough for their consumption.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the growing expenses of her family as her children grow older, Flor wants to improve her family's economic status by growing her business and no longer borrowing money from usurious money lenders who charge huge interest rates. She felt very lucky that she was able to join ASHI and had the opportunity to request a loan that has the smallest interest rate. With the loans she is requesting now and can request in the next months or years, the life of her family will improve and her dream ensuring that her children graduate from college will be achieved.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":525254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

This is 45-year-old Ibrahim from Waterloo branch, eastern area in Freetown. He is married with 3 children between the ages of 2 years and 21 years. Two of his children attend school. He started this type of business because it is not diminishing in value.\r\n \r\nIbrahim runs an assorted goods store at his marketplace. He sells items such as shoes, bags, suitcases and grinding machines. He has been running this business for 12 years. He works at the business from 7am until 6pm, 6 days per week. His business is the only source of income he has.

As a Balinese woman, it has been a tradition to raise pigs at home. Most of such business are side business. This is not the case for Ni Putu Artini, since this business could bring good profit for her family, if done well. Ni Putu Artini runs this pig farming with dicipline and persistence, since she wants to advance family economic situation. Before, Ni Putu Artini only raised 1 mother pig. That mother pig bore up to 12 piglets. After 4 months those piglets could be sold for Rp 250,000 (about US$28)\/each. After subtracting all expenses, Ni Putu Artini could still have enough profit to support her family. With Dinari's loan, Ni Putu Artini plans to buy 1 other mother pig. She already calculated: With the mother pig ready to be impregnated, and ready to bore piglets, within the 6 month loan, Ni Putu Artini could sell the pig feedstock, and the loan could be returned timely.

Sebagai seorang wanita Bali, sudah menjadi tradisi untuk memelihara babi dirumah. Sebagian besar memang usaha ini digunakan sebagi usaha sampingan. Hal itu tidak berlaku bagi Ni Putu Artini, karena usaha ini baginya dapat mendatangkan keuntungan yang cukup besar bagi keluarganya jika diolah dengan baik. Ni Putu Artini mengelola usaha ternak babi dengan disiplin dan rajin, karena ia sangat ingin memajukan perekonomian keluarganya. Sebelumnya Ni Putu Artini memelihara 1 ekor induk. Dari 1 ekor induk itu bisa melahirkan anak sampai dengan 12 ekor. Setelah dipelihara selama 4 bulan, anak babi itu bisa dijual kembali dengan harga Rp. 250.000.- per ekor. Dengan dikurangi semua biaya pengeluaran yang ada untuk perawatan, Ni Putu Artini masih bisa mendapat keuntungan yang dipergunakan untuk kehidupan keluarga.\r\nDengan pinjaman dari Dinari, Ni Putu Artini membelikannya 1 ekor induk lagi.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Part of this production will be consumed by their families and the rest will be sold wholesale and for cash to the business people of Bougouni. <P>\r\n\r\nAfter reimbursing the interest on the loan, the group expects to make a profit of 275,000 F CFA at the end of the growing season, which will be used to support their families. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":364433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"agricultural inputs and fees for plowing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chaka                        ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minkoro               ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madou Moussa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama                       ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ousmane              ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama                    ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominique                ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama Minkoro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1325,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":602750.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021349}],"funded_date":"2009-09-05T15:24:39Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":131294,"name":"Coste\u00f1itas Ii Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"El  centro focal villa Exaltaci\u00f3n encuentra ubicado en la zona del mismo nombre,de la ciudad de El Alto, a este pertenece la asociaci\u00f3n \u201cCoste\u00f1itas II\u201d, actualmente est\u00e1 formado por diez miembros.

She owns a business venture selling fruits and vegetables.  Taulafo Elenoa has 2 years of experience in this business.  Taulafo Elenoa needs a loan of WST $1000 0.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  \n\nIn 2008, Taulafo Elenoa joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Taulafo Elenoa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks. Elenoa is a client who willing to help her family as she now rejoins the program.\n\nThe following social metrics for Taulafo Elenoa S. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, selling fried foods in the local community.  Fulisia has 1 year of experience in this business.  Fulisia needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Fulisia joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fulisia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She has had her business for six years, starting when she received her first loan in Esperanza. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business, where she has a little grocery stand and takes it to the local public school to sell snacks, candies and other groceries. She also sell shoes and clothing. She will use the profits to invest and save. She wants to run her business from home or her own location, because she doesn't want in the future to be moving.\r\n \r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she was needing motivation to start a business, which she received in her group and with Esperanza. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in the rural areas surrounding Hato Mayor, an area where the economy is dominated by agriculture. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":590406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery
