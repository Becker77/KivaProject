Her whole life was spent in a hometown of Balykchy, which is translated from Kyrgyz language as \u201cfisherman\u201d. The town used to be a major industrial and transportation center, but most of its activities stopped after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Zuura is one of 40 000 people, who stayed in a town regardless of the difficult economic times. Zuura pursued a major in medicine and has been curing people for a major portion of her life. She works in a diagnostic center of a local hospital, and gets paid 2,000 soms monthly, and receives additional help of 2,700 from social fund. Zuura lives with her husband and a 13 year old son. She applied for this loan to help push forward her husband\u2019s business. It was started six years ago, when her husband invested all his return from driving a cab in acquisition of raw material for his new business. Zuura\u2019s husband is very handy and makes various types of furniture, household appliances and trailers for trucks. Business is well-advanced now and the family already opened its own workshop. It made her husband\u2019s work more comfortable and effective. The proceeded return of 8 000 soms unfortunately is not enough to accomplish all orders that he is receiving now. Therefore Zuura asks for a loan in order to purchase raw materials such as ironmongery, pipes, plywood and planks. \r\n\r\n       --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Juan, empez\u00f3 su aventura como carpintero desde muy ni\u00f1o en el taller de sus padres. Su pasi\u00f3n  por el oficio lo llev\u00f3 adquirir sus propias herramientas de trabajo donde viene puliendo madera desde hace 22 a\u00f1os en su taller. Asimismo es proveedor de sus servicios trabaja con colegios e instituciones y municipalidades de la zona realizando el trabajo de mesas, sillas, andamios, roperos, escritorios, entre otros. Cuenta con 03 ayudantes, quienes se encargan de terminar con el trabajo; se siente muy comprometido con su labor, su lema es la puntualidad en la entrega del mueble que le piden. Sin embargo parte del riesgo de su trabajo es tener que absorber el polvo de la madera pulida, por ello tiene que ir cada cierto tiempo al m\u00e9dico hacerse un chequeo. Su mayor problema es no tener capital para poder comprar m\u00e1s madera, por ello recurre a MFP, para que le facilite el cr\u00e9dito.

He lives with Vilma, age 38, and they have 5 children.  They live together in their own home where understanding and mutual support reign.\r\n<p>\r\nJuan began working as a carpenter at a very young age in his father\u2019s shop.  His passion for the work led him to acquire his own tools, and since the age of 22 he has been working with wood in his own shop.  He also provides his services working for high schools, institutions, and municipalities in his area making tables, chairs, scaffolding, closets, and desks, among other things.  He has three helpers who are charged with doing finishing work.  He is very involved with his work.  His main goal is the punctual delivery of furniture that is ordered.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the risks associated with his work is that he has to breathe the dust from working wood.  That\u2019s why every so often he goes to the doctor for a checkup. His biggest problem is that he does not have the capital needed to buy more wood.  That\u2019s why he has gone to MFP to obtain a loan.  Now, his greatest priority is to buy wood since this is the principal factor for his production.  This is Juan\u2019s first loan with MFP.  He is committed to meeting his payment schedule since he wants to acquire another loan later.  With the 1500 new soles applied for he will buy bundles of wood.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":743629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase bundles of wood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-04T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":101.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":106.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":109.21},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":114.57},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":117.31},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":120.43},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":127.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":130.53},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":135.27},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":140.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":145.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.89},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.86},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.6},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.28,"local_amount":101.66,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":104.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196472},{"amount":39.23,"local_amount":106.99,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":110.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270149},{"amount":40.04,"local_amount":109.21,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":112.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550168},{"amount":85.02,"local_amount":231.88,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":238.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350308},{"amount":45.48,"local_amount":124.04,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:29Z","rounded_local_amount":127.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850802},{"amount":47.25,"local_amount":128.86,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":132.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621132},{"amount":97.25,"local_amount":265.23,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":272.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835305},{"amount":51.04,"local_amount":139.21,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:24Z","rounded_local_amount":143.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245102},{"amount":87.27,"local_amount":238,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":244.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098399},{"amount":20.14,"local_amount":54.92,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:48Z","rounded_local_amount":56.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714199}],"funded_date":"2011-04-04T22:45:09Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rick & Pat Brown","image":null}},{"id":291546,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of eight children, Gemma B. works hard to support her family.

Celidonia in her stable mainly breeds a sheep and 2 cows that she takes each day to pasture in the open fields so that they can eat. However, when there is little time she lets them pass the night in a small farm that she has on a hill to take care of her animals and they can enjoy the grass, sometimes she spends weeks in this place. Celidonia also grows potatoes, broad beans, oca (an Andean tuber) and other food products on her land. Most of the time her son helps her take care of the land, but during the harvest season she needs extra labor and hires day laborers. At present, selling animals is profitable which is why she needs your support for a loan that will allow her to buy more animals.

In order to make her sales business more successful and increase her profit, Mrs. Et has asked for some funds from Kiva to buy additional items for resale.

The more items displayed at the store the better, as they help to attract more customers and thus increase her profits, some of which she will use for her children's school expenses. <p>\r\n\r\nMinerva hopes that her business will continue to earn sufficient income for the needs of her family. She dreams of maintaining her youngest in the special school and continuing to fund her medicines. She hopes that her other children will have a stable life once they have their own families.

End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

All the members of the group are mothers and fathers whose children are their principal preoccupation, especially with regards to their educations and futures. Many of the partners have more than one job to cover their children's needs as well as many obligations to suppliers and banks.  For this reason, they need a loan that will help them get working capital to buy inputs, merchandise, materials, and tools that will help them improve their final products and businesses so that they can make money, which would translate into a better quality of life for their families. \r\n\r\nThe majority of the female partners work selling food, bread, or cosmetics or work as domestic employees.  The male partners work in agriculture, public transportation, caretaking for houses, gardening, or construction.  For example, the president of the group is a waitress in a restaurant and uses her free time to selling cosmetics from a catalog so that she can dedicate herself to her little boy, who is her reason for living.  She lives together with her parents who help her pay basic costs, but what she wants more than anything is to be independent. She wants to buy a a lot so she can have a more comfortable house, where her parents can also live with her.\r\n\r\nThe competition among small businesses is high, but the group's partners know how to get ahead.  The partners are now in their second loan cycle, which demonstrates their responsibility, honesty, and ability to get ahead with hard work and effort so that they can improve the quality of life for them and their families.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":478771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4275,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yackeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Angelica Marioly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Nicolas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2345.7},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2372.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2400},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2427.61},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2455.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2483.8},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2512.39},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2541.3},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2570.54},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2600.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2630.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2660.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.26},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":338.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":349.91},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.02},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lydia Brantley","image":null}},{"id":176438,"name":"Ka-La-Mayre Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pictured above are members of the Ka-La-Mayre group from Makeni, a city in northern Sierra Leone.

Her children are young and working, so she prefers to stay at home to fulfill the household responsibilities and to take care of her family.\r\n  \r\nShe has given birth to six children: three sons and three daughters. Her eldest son is involved in an agriculture profession and works in the fields, and her second eldest is an employee in a factory. Her remaining children are enrolled in a local school and getting their education. \r\n\r\nBilqees has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to help her eldest son in his business. With the loan she will buy fertilizers and seeds in order to get better crops from the field.\r\n \r\nShe started this business four years ago, and Bilqees is confident that the loan investment will be a good help for her son to earn better profits from his work.\r\n \r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah, and this is her third loan application. In previous loan years, she has maintained good credit behavior and never missed any meeting.\r\n \r\nNote: In the photo, the lady holding the book (called Asasah Passbook) is Bilqees.

She is married to Constantino, a driver. Editha, her husband and their children manage their own household while operating their business. Editha works hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEditha oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have two jeepney units that have a capacity of 18 people who pay a boundary (daily quota) each day. Editha\u2019s husband also drives one of their jeepneys if their driver is not available. Their regular customers are students and employees in the local community. The business collects a minimum of PHP 1,800 in boundary every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Editha is requesting a PHP 28,000 loan to pay for spare parts and maintenance of her jeepneys. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEditha dreams of acquiring another jeep or van. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nFootnote: Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Later, she takes them out to sell to the surrounding communities. \n\nMaria is requesting the loan to invest it in purchasing more beauty products like lotions and creams, among others. During the Christmas season she sells them for better prices, which will help her to obtain a better income. As the products she offers sell sufficiently she can make better offers.

The official name of this borrowing group is Rubilyn A. Group.\r\n\r\nRubilyn is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Rubilyn owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community.

She has been in this business for 2 years and considers the most difficult part to be having to stay in her store the majority of the day, as it doesn\u2019t leave her much time to cultivate her lands.  In the future, she hopes to expand her store to have more products in stock to sell.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Gladys\u2019 third loan with MFP.  She knows that if she makes her loan payments on time, she will be able to access another loan more easily and without making complications for her communal bank, where she is very well-liked by the rest of her partners.  With the 2,000 PEN requested, she will purchase more goods for her grocery store and increase her stock of products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kathleen O&#039;Connell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":514533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-26T15:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2002.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153955}],"funded_date":"2010-03-27T03:23:27Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen O'Connell","image":578556}},{"id":193234,"name":"Dora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dora tiene 45 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo y sus 8 hijos en su casa propia.

She has been farming for seven years and employs one farmhand. Her mixed farm produces milk, vegetables, and eggs which she sells to the local market. Lucy also earns income from her shop which she operates in the same area. Her biggest challenge has been poultry diseases which reduce her productivity.\r\n\r\nLucy has requested this loan of 50,000 KES through Juhudi Kilimo to expand her poultry project. The increased income from this project will enable her send her children to good schools. She wishes to have 500 chickens and a posho mill, which is used to grind maize into flour, in the next five years.\r\n\r\nLucy has been pictured with her dairy cows because it was not possible to take

From the very first hours of each morning, he works on his land which he managed to obtain through hard work and commitment.  What he most likes about his work is being able to get rid of the weeds that grow on his plantations.  They are a real headache because if they are allowed to grow they can ruin his sown fields.  However, without doubt, the days that Aurelio enjoys are the dates when he takes his harvest to the wholesale market in his town, where he sells his produce and sees all his hard work pay off.  This hard-working man also raises cows and rams, selling the milk and wool which they produce. \r\n\r\nThis is Aurelio's tenth loan from MFP and he is certain that through the joint work of the members of his community bank, they will be able to get ahead in the development of their goals.

She is a good wife and mother who cares for her family.  In addition, she does sewing for neighborhood clients, a skill she learned from her mother before marriage.\r\n\r\nHer husband\u2019s name is T. H. and he sells timber in areas where gas is not available, and people use firewood to cook their food. \r\n\r\nZarina has a son and 2 daughters. Her son is a motorbike mechanic who works at a repair shop.  Her daughters are enrolled in a local school and getting their education. \r\n\r\nZarina has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to assist her husband in his timber-selling business. With the loan, he will buy firewood in bulk which will help him fulfill customer demand and sell greater quantities in order to earn more profit.  She is hopeful that the loan investment will bring positive financial results for his business. She is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her second loan application. With her previous loan, she established good credit and never missed a meeting.  \r\n\r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the woman holding a book (the Asasah Passbook) is Zarina.

is involved in a number of businesses in order to help support her husband and three children. On Sundays, her week begins with setting up her stand and filling it with as many shoes, shoe accessories, purses, and t-shirts as it can hold. This is done in one of the newer markets just outside the city center of Ayacucho, Peru. She and her fellow market vendors are slowly recruiting more vendors to this market in order to create a popular new destination for the Ayacuchan population. On Tuesdays, Nora returns to the market to sell shoes from her stand as well. Nora\u2019s week ends on Saturday when she wakes up very early in the morning and travels to a chicken and fish farm in the city. There, she buys a large supply of meat which she transports via bus to the rural countryside. Once well outside the city, Nora sets up a stand selling the fresh meat by the kilo. She also makes sure, she says, to bring along supply of shoes to sell, because a variety of products is the key to attracting customers. \r\n<p>\r\nThe days that Nora isn\u2019t selling products from behind one of her three different stands are not spent idly. Her husband also works extremely hard, explains Nora, and while he is away, she takes care of their three children. In fact everything Nora does is for her kids. She is currently saving up her money to buy a house for herself and her husband, leaving the house they presently own for her sons and their families. Professionally, Nora says her dream is to leave the tiresome traveling behind and open a small grocery store. \r\n<p>\r\nAll these dreams are possible thanks in large part to Nora\u2019s involvement with her village bank. For the past 4 years, she has been learning how to save her money and accumulate capital. Nora is requesting a loan of $900. With this money, she will buy a larger supply and greater quantity of shoes and sandals to sell from her stand in the market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":84991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy a larger supply and greater quantity of shoes and sandals to sell from her stand in the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-19T01:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-04T17:41:27Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2697,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":674.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":674.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":674.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":674.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":674.25,"processed_date":"2008-01-04T10:19:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":674.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108264},{"amount":225,"local_amount":674.25,"processed_date":"2008-02-04T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":674.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128257},{"amount":225,"local_amount":674.25,"processed_date":"2008-03-04T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":674.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":149305},{"amount":225,"local_amount":674.25,"processed_date":"2008-04-04T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":674.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":173649}],"funded_date":"2007-11-20T17:41:27Z","paid_date":"2008-04-04T10:12:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28512,"name":"Marie","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Mrs. Marie A. is married and the mother of 4 children.

","en":"64-year old Edelmira lives with her 28-year old son Javier; her four other children have already left home and have their own families. She earns her living by selling food in the small restaurant she has opened in her home. There she attends her customers who come every day to eat her delicious meals. She\u2019s been doing this work for 20 years, serving a variety of dishes such as barbecued chicken and chicharron (traditional pork dish). Now, as her client base is continuing to grow, she does not want to lower the quality of the service she provides. She also needs time to raise guinea pigs. It is for this reason that one of her daughters-in-law often comes to help with this task. As if that weren\u2019t enough, she has also ventured into the business of renting out rooms\u2014when her children left home, they left behind unused rooms, so she decided to take advantage of the situation and rent them out. Edelmira hopes to be able to continue working for some time; as she herself says she still has the strength to do a lot herself, but in the future she would like to have a small store where she can serve customers without rushing around and in the process make some good friends.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with Kiva partner, Microfinanzas Prisma, and she has always been very punctual with her repayments. With the loan she will buy a greater quantity of food so she can make more dishes; with the rest of the money she will renovate and paint some rooms to rent out and in this way earn more money.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":294848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy supplies for her restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-03T15:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edelmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012345},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595934},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990197},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211322},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640836},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:55Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080305},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996512},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":256.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842018}],"funded_date":"2009-04-04T02:03:26Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":102263,"name":"Qantu Huayta Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Las socias del Banco Comunal Qantu Wayta son  D. la comunidad D.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Palmadera' (The Flowers of Palmadera) community bank belongs to the community of Palmadera, located in the Acoria district of Huancavelica province, in the department of Huancavelica. The majority of the population in this zone work in production and they organize themselves jointly to finance their work in Ayaccocha, Hucro and Huancavelica. The majority work in agriculture, livestock, and business.\r\n\r\nThe community bank consists of 17 partners who request loans between 200 and 800 PEN to use in their businesses; the sum of all loans is 7,100 PEN.\r\n\r\nLeonarda is married and has 3 children who are 14, 8, and 6 years old. She sells meat. Leonarda buys pigs and rams; she kills them at her house and sells the meat. Her husband and children help her in the business. The greatest difficulty that she faces is the region's flash floods, often requiring her to rebuild her business. She requests a loan of 400 PEN to buy livestock and feed for the animals. Her dream is to sell wholesale, for which she would need to invest more money. Currently she is saving to buy blankets for her children, who study out of town.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica is married and has 5 children who are 13, 10, 8, 6 and 2 years old. With her first loan she received 6 months ago, she bought clothes for her children, not knowing to invest in her business. Only with part of the loan she bought small animals to raise at home and sell, slowly repaying her loan. Because of the bad investment she had problems but in spite of the difficulties she felt responsible and repaid her first loan. She requests another loan of 800 PEN to start her business; she wants to have a chicken farm so she can sell and eat the eggs.

It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

E. is a native of the gated community of San Juan de Limay.  He was granted a loan in order to purchase three steers for fattening.  He started his business planting sorghum and corn and worked with his father.  Later he decided to buy bulls for fattening, which is one of the businesses he now operates.\r\n<p>\r\nJorge has worked in this business every day for over the past ten years.  He still spends time planting sorghum and corn during the winter season in order to generate income to buy more animals.  He hopes his loan will be invested well so that he can continue working.

Elvia is the mother of three children who are all adults now; they sometimes help her out economically.

Cetty is a loving and diligent mother.  She has 8 children, her youngest three still live with her and attend school at the city education center.  She works every day in a shop in her small home, which she set up with the help of her older children.  She also counts on a monthly income she gets from selling items in a small village near the Ucayali river, with the help of her oldest daughter who works as a teacher in that town.  With the combined income from these activities she is able to take good care of the children who still live with her.  After a careful evaluation, she has proposed that she increase the stock in her small shop to meet the requests of the families who live near the river, so they don't have to buy them in the market.  With this extra money, the family would be able to improve their quality of life and education.   She is requesting a loan of $500, which she will use to grow her business.   Let's help her realize her goals with our generous support. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nCetty, es una amorosa y diligente madre, tiene ocho hijos y mantiene guarecidos en el seno de su hogar s\u00f3lo a tres de ellos; debido a que a\u00fan son muy peque\u00f1os y se encuentran estudiando en un centro educativo de su hermosa ciudad. Desempe\u00f1a sus labores diarias en una peque\u00f1a bodega que instal\u00f3, con ayuda de sus hijos mayores, en un espacio de su humilde morada. Adicionalmente cuenta con un ingreso mensual que obtiene por los art\u00edculos que comercializa en un peque\u00f1o pueblo que se ubica en el margen del r\u00edo Ucayali, con ayuda de su hija mayor que trabaja como maestra en un centro educativo de ese lugar. Con la suma de estos ingresos puede otorgarles bienestar a los ni\u00f1os que a\u00fan viven con ella.As\u00ed  mismo luego de haber hecho una evaluaci\u00f3n rigurosa se ha propuesto incrementar el stock de su peque\u00f1a bodega con el prop\u00f3sito de abastecer los pedidos que realizan mensualmente las familias de la peque\u00f1a localidad ubicada al margen del r\u00edo para evitar comprarlo en el mercado, con este incremento de dinero la familia tambi\u00e9n podr\u00e1 acrecentar su nivel de vida y educaci\u00f3n siendo \u00e9ste el prop\u00f3sito primordial de esta sacrificada madre.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

E. \r\n\r\nMy family and I had to leave the town where we lived, San Sami\u00e1n \u2013 Huarochir\u00ed.  We had to go to Lima due to a work proposal my husband received.  Unfortunately, he suffered an accident in transit.  He could not keep working as a bricklayer for one year.  \r\n\r\nAt the root of this situation, I see myself in the necessity of working for my family.  I had to go up and down the streets with my two small children knocking door to door selling food and fruit.  I also washed clothes and helped cook in popular dining rooms to survive and not leave my family abandoned.  Even so, these earnings did not cover the expenses that we had.  \r\n\r\nI soon came to learn from a nephew who participates in EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD about the loans they give to people like me, entrepreneurs.  I realized that this was the opportunity that I was looking for to progress economically.  That is how I became part of the Luz D. San Antonio Community Bank.  I am currently the president.  Thirteen people participate.  We work in businesses.\r\n\r\nWith my first loan that I got from EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD, I could buy merchandise like flowers, medicinal plants, and natural medicines.

She is 30 years old and she is living with their two children in their village in Punit Benito Soliven, Isabela. Her husband Luisito is currently working in another country as a Project Engineer.  Their two children are Michael Angelo, eight years old, and Darlene Gaile, one year old. The couple sacrifices by being away from each other just to meet the daily needs and future welfare of their children who have growing needs. Jennifer hopes that someday, they will be able to send their two children to school and see them earn their degrees in college.<P>\r\n\r\nJennifer retails cell phone loads for Smart and Globe subscribers.  Her customers usually buy their load by sending a text message and she will also send the load through a text.  She ventured into this business so she can  help her husband in supporting the needs of their family.  She is requesting a loan amounting to PHP 4,000 from KIVA lenders to be used as additional capital.  Electronic loading is very much in demand in their village and Jennifer wants to maximize her loan and be productive in the business. She hopes that her business will be supported by KIVA lenders.

She is 27 years old, married, and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Roselyn owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Roselyn has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Roselyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Roselyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from GDMPC. Roselyn is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Roselyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the her children and to cover daily expenses. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

For the last 12 years she has devoted herself to selling second hand clothes that she acquires from the capital city.  To get the bags of clothing, she travels to Lima every 15 days and on some occasions she has her merchandise sent to her. Her best sales take place during commercial markets and during festivals in rural areas of her locality. In their spare time, her husband and her oldest daughter help transport the merchandise.  For Gaudecia, this work has allowed her to have the necessary earnings to support her family, and adds to the money her husband.  For the future, she wishes to have a more permanent stall where she can conduct her sales more comfortably and with higher frequency.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that she has a loan with MFP and is happy to have a boost in her capital to improve her business.  With the money, she will buy more clothes to increase her sales. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Colleen  Godfrey, Kiva

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 48 years old, married to Sr. Anselmo Clemente, and has eight children.  Trinidad and Mar\u00eda Elena are the only children still in school, a first year high school student and a fifth graD. student respectively.  The others are married.  Crecencia sells soft drinks, which she has been doing for three years.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe chose this business activity because she wanted to find a way to move her children forward and help her husband with the household expenses.  For this reason, she decided to start a small business and now she says she generates good earnings.  The loan she will receive will be invested in the purchase of more merchandise such as soft drinks, water, and juices.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Crecencia says that her plan is to continue investing in her business so that it will grow even more.  She wants to establish a grocery store so that she can improve and increase her income to help cover her children\u2019s educational expenses.

These sales enable her to cover the cost of her weekly food and some other incidental expenses.\r\n\r\nDedicaci\u00f3n is grateful to God for all the support that she has received and, in spite of how demanding it is working on her farm, she is happy that she owns her farm and is able to work it for her children.\r\n\r\nDedicaci\u00f3n belongs to the \"Mirando a un futuro mejor\" community bank and this is her 12th loan from MFP.  She will continue working for the development of her bank.  As a long-standing member of her bank, Dedicaci\u00f3n pledges to be punctual in making her loan repayments.

very hardworking, responsible women who all live in different places but the group members meet in Socorro\u2019s house because due to health issues she\u2019s unable to go out; she can\u2019t walk because the doctors have recommended that she rest for two months so the group members will meet in her house.  The place where she lives is on a little hill where every morning the sun arrives first, this is what Socorro relates.\r\n\r\nThe group is called \u201cEspuma de Mar\u201d (Sea Foam).  They chose this name because it occured to them and also because it\u2019s been used in other communal banks.  \r\n\r\nCaro, 28, is the group representative.  She\u2019s married to Gustavo who works as a cashier and they have two children: Jaime, 9, attending fourth grade in elementary school and Leslie, 4, in second grade of preschool.\r\n\r\nCaro raises chickens that she buys when they are little and then sells when they are big.  She comments that she\u2019s been in this business four years and has no great difficulty except when they become ill but if that happens Caro takes them to the veterinarian so there\u2019s no big problem.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion she\u2019s asked for the loan to buy 150 chicks, corn and feed.  Her goal for the chicks she\u2019ll soon buy is that they grow soon so that she can sell them within three months to help her husband with schooling and household expenses.  She also wants to save up some money so that when her husband is out of work they will still be able to eat.  She comments: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult when my husband, Gustavo, isn\u2019t working because we don\u2019t have what\u2019s needed to cover our children\u2019s basic needs like food, shoes, school supplies.  That\u2019s why I and the other group members are very grateful for the loan we are being granted.  This is our first time and we don\u2019t intend to disappoint, especially me who as group representative must set the example.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other group members will use the loan for other activities like:  Francisca, Juana and Socorro will buy chicks to raise and later sell; Maribel will buy underwear; Cinthya will invest in catalogue comforters and fragrances and finally, Brisa will invest in her bedspread and shoe business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":918126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 150 chicks, feed and corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-11-30T01:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cintia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":937.5,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":13145.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785118},{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":6572.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193681},{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6572.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330042}],"funded_date":"2011-11-30T17:42:27Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":369501,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is a married woman with two children; one attends school.

She is married to Roberto, a craftsman and father of their two children.  Wilson is 26 years old, and Neri is 19 years old.  She lives with her husband, her children, and two grandchildren in her own house.\n\nElena\u2019s business is selling general groceries.  She opened a grocery store in her house in order to do this.  She also sells yuccas, and she kindly tends to her customers.  She started with financial support from MFP.  She purchased in small quantities, and she managed to grow from the foundation of hard work.  Over the time that she had her business she worked alone.  However, starting over six month ago she counts on her son\u2019s help in waiting on the public.\n\nShe considers her business to be profitable because of the income it gives her, and because she has a regular clientele.  Her business allows her to be at home in order to be able to tend to her young child.  The financial income serves her to buy what she needs for her household.  On the other hand, she does not like that some of her customers ask for credit.  When it comes time to pay they put it off.  Even so, she sees that her business is well-received.  Therefore, she wishes to grow and expand her grocery store until she can convert it into a bazaar where she will be able to sell all types of products.\n\nThis will be her third loan with MFP.  She hopes for your collaboration so that she will be able to firm up her plans.  Also, she feels good with her communal bank.  She knows most of them, and new members are joining.  She hopes they will be as responsible as the rest of the group.  She will use the requested 2000 soles to buy wholesale groceries like sugar, rice, oil, and others for her grocery store.  She will also buy yuccas because the prices for this product are rising, which leaves her with greater income.\n\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1050623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy sugar, rice, oil, and yucca.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":302.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":299.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":330.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":344.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":350.99},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":372.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":509055,"name":"Copaboka 1 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame V\u00e9ronique, membre du groupe COPABOKA 1, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 54 ans, cultivatrice du riz,  a 10 enfants dont le plus \u00e2g\u00e9 a 30 ans et le moins \u00e2g\u00e9 a 8 ans. 8 de ses enfants vont \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole et n'a aucune autre personne en sa charge.

has a small plot of land that she bought about 30 years ago. She lives on the land with her son and his family of three children. They primarily plant rice, but also raise chickens and pigs as a secondary source of income. She hopes to invest the money in making her production greater by buying fertilizer. With her extra income she also wants to help her grandchildren go to school and hopefully make more investments in her land. \r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":25838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-11T00:05:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-25T08:36:05Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":113,"local_amount":113,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T09:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21413},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T19:38:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T09:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31799},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-08-20T18:26:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T09:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44801},{"amount":313,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:50:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T09:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":313,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107757},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-05-13T16:13:44Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T09:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":209418}],"funded_date":"2007-04-11T08:36:05Z","paid_date":"2008-05-13T16:13:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12159,"name":"Ruslan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

With the most recent loan from Manuela Ramos, which she will fulfill in 6 payments, she will purchase bulk beans, banana clusters, bulk honey, and large quantities of regional fruits, including papaya, coconut, noni, along with other products that she has needed to purchase almost daily, including long coriander, green onions, Chinese cabbage, lettuce, avocados, yucca, etc. To maintain her clientele, she makes sure that her stand is in order and that the product that she offers is fresh. She has 6 children and is 61 years old. Nearly all of her children anre independent now, and she now only supports the youngest. She enjoys her daily activities in her home, and her work in market, now that she has established a strong clientele by offering quality products.

She is 41 years old. Celita is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Celita owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Celita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Celita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Celita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Celita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Celita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sattorkul is a 52-year-old farmer, who lives with his wife and four children in the northern part of Tajikistan, in the Shahristan region.

Milk products are in great demand in his village and Sattorkul\u2019s orders for them are very high.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At this occupation she works on the weekdays but on the weekends she runs their restaurant where they serve a lengthy menu, especially using pork meat. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of the community bank for 3 years, though she took a leave of absence. She is on her second loan cycle. She very much enjoys working with the community bank because she gets to collaborate with her friends. The loan will be invested in the purchase of more livestock. Her goal is to make her businesses grow.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":582607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-08-13T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Florinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166847074},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113530},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407220},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407221},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388309},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388310},{"amount":165,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:54Z","rounded_local_amount":165,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682807}],"funded_date":"2010-08-15T14:48:45Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":226056,"name":"Sroin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sroin K.

Camburong, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a pig fattening and motorcycle business. Her husband, Onesimo B., who is 54 years old, works as a driver to earn his living. They have six children who are between 11 and 30 years old. One of them has a family, while three others are working to help out in the house, and the youngest two go to school. Marcelina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. Marcelina B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marcelina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus improving the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her ninth loan, she wants to borrow PHP 15,000 to use as additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for the future and support the family's needs. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She started her business in 2006 and has since gained much experience. Today, her working capital exceeds 600,000 Mongolian tugriks (MNT). In addition, she plants and grows a variety of vegetables to sell at the local market for a profit. \r\n\r\nFor the future, she plans to increase her working capital for her meat-trading business and enlarge the field where she plants her vegetables in order to increase her vegetable sales. With her business earnings, she was able to afford to buy her own house with fence. \r\n\r\nEnhtuya is a hardworking and modest person and is requesting a 700,000 MNT loan to purchase and preserve a large amount of meat in order to sell it during the spring months, when prices for such products traditionally rise.

What Blas most enjoys is going out every morning with his radio and watering and fertilizing his crops to the rhythm of the music.  He says \"the countryside is my life\".  As a boy, Blas grew up learning how to grow crops and this is all he learned.  Every harvest is a symbol of his perseverance and the attention that he has given his crops.  Blas owns farmland in different places in town which means that he grows in large quantities.  In the wholesale market in his town, Blas not only sells his harvested crops but also the meat from the sheep that he raises.  However, unlike others in his town, he also sells the wool of these animals which is very thick and provides protection from the cold.  Blas would like to buy a truck so that he can transport the crops and animals that he sells more easily.\r\n\r\nBlas is a member of the \"Mirando a un futuro mejor\" community bank and this is his eighth loan from MFP.
