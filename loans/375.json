Ever since she was young, she has made an effort to improve her life. She lives in her own house with her children, Sandra (age 12) and Javier (age 11). She works nonstop so that she can reach the goals that she has set forth. In her small adobe house, Emilia has been knitting scarves, gloves, sweaters, etc. for 5 years, distributing her knitwear at the most bustling markets of Juliaca, where mainly tourists buy her merchandise. Emilia has a fun time making her artisanal knitwork, which fills her with the satisfaction of knowing that this is a way that she can feed her family. In time, she hopes to have a more stable business that will bring in better earnings because she knows she must provide a good education for her children. They repay her sacrifice with love, and they always accompany her wherever she goes. This is her 2nd loan with MFP. She has been very punctual with her payments, and has never had any problems with her microfinance institute, where she is in charge of bringing the joy that keeps her group members happy.

He is married and the father of a 3 year-old daughter. He went to school until 7th grade but didn't finish due to the lack of financial resources. He lives in his own home with his family and also supports two siblings who live with him. \r\n\r\nHe left Vilanculos to look for a job in the Namaacha District. He started his business more than 7 years ago. Today, he owns his own appliance store in Namaacha's Central Market. He has one employee who helps him with the business. He has an income of 6,500 meticais per month, which is used in household expenses and still saves some in his bank account. \r\n\r\nHe has never had loans with other banks. He became familiar with Hluvuku through neighbors who are also salespeople. This is Antonio's fifth loan with Hluvuku and fourth with Kiva, in the amount of 20,000 meticais. He intends to purchase prepaid cell phone cards, appliances and others to increase his   inventory. The previous loans were for 5,000, 7,000, 10,000 and 15,000 meticais. All were used for this same goal. \r\n\r\nHe is confident he will once again pay the loan back ahead of schedule and request new loans. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

She is 67 years old, married, and lives in her own house along with her husband and one of her daughters. Lourdes\u2019s business is selling food. She does this in the entrance to her home and she tells us that with the help of her daughter she has been working in this business for almost 2 years. What she likes most about her work is that she can have fun at the same time she is earning an income. Also, she really likes working alongside her daughter, who is her main help in the business. What she doesn\u2019t like is having to close up and not sell anything whenever there is a heavy rain, which is very common in her area. The location of her business is a busy street which is why she always has regular customers and some travelers who are very pleased with her friendly service and comfortable prices. She is planning to expand her house so that she doesn\u2019t have to bring in all of her products every time it rains. This is Lourdes\u2019s first loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She expects to be able to pay on time and not let down the person who recommended her, and much less the group, which has treated her very well since she became a member. With the PEN 1,000.00 she has requested, she will buy materials to expand the front of her house, such as wooden supports, wood, tin roofing, and also ingredients and other inputs for her business.

He studied until the 5th grade and stopped due to the financial situation of his family.  Aside from his wife and kids, he is not responsible for other family members and he lives in his own home.  He left Inhambane for Maputo with his older brothers to seek out a better life.  He has lived in the Boane district for 8 years.  It was in this area that he learned how to do small jobs as a way of earning money to survive.  He sells new clothes that he purchases in South Africa (pants and swimwear).  For example, he buys a swimsuit for 870MT and resells it for 1,200MT.  He earns about 16,000MT per month with this business.  He has already been a client of TCHUMA (a similar loan institution in Boane).  He heard about Hluvuku-Adsema through friends that told him about the advantages of a low interest rate and a flexible repayment schedule.  This is Ricardo\u2019s first loan [with Hluvuku-Adsema] and it is for 15,000MT to buy more clothing.  He pleges to repay this loan without problems so that he will qualify for more loans in the future.  He would like to eventually purchase a vehicle for transportation and hauling various cargo.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":385229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"purchase clothing for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-11T14:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo Orlando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":681.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":709.29},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":738.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":768.79},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":800.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":833.27},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":867.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":903.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":940.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":978.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1019.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1061.04},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1104.64},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1150.04},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1197.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1246.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.19},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.3},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.47},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.08},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.9},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":73.67,"local_amount":1921.92,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1988.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056870},{"amount":74.74,"local_amount":1949.68,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2016.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816765},{"amount":80.38,"local_amount":2096.93,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2169.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708945},{"amount":273.37,"local_amount":7131.41,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":7377.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937979},{"amount":72.84,"local_amount":1900.06,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1965.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937980}],"funded_date":"2009-09-14T00:20:07Z","paid_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":139634,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruth G. is from the village of D-6, Canitoan, Cagayan De Oro City.

Dedication and hard work is required to support all of the needs of the family. But for Teresita S., this problem did not arise because she is lucky that her husband Alberto strives hard to provide for their family in spite of his low income as a farmer.\r\nTeresita is now 51 years old with 11 children who range in age from 10 to 32 years old. Most of the younger ones are still in school but the older children are already working and helping to support the family. This family of 13 lives in the village of Bi-ao, in the town of Binalbagan, Negros Occidental.\r\nTo help her husband support their family, Teresita started with pig fattening and raising chickens, selling the chickens in the local market after raising them for 45 days. This venture became a family affair as the younger kids were able to help with the chores of feeding the animals and cleaning their pens, which were all located in the backyard of their house.\r\nSeeing that she could earn a respectable income from such an activity, Teresita wanted to expand her pig fattening and chicken operations but she needed additional capital to buy the piglets and the chicks. This is the reason why she decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000. \r\nWith access to additional funds, she was able to increase the number of animals and was also able to start a general store adjacent to their house. Now her lowest monthly profit is 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) from these business activities. This has a big impact in defraying their household expenses and has enabled her to set aside some money for the higher education of her children. They have also been able to buy a small sugarcane farm that her husband now manages.\r\nHer previous loan of PHP29,500 was used as additional capital for her business activities and now that she has paid that off, she is borrowing the same amount of PHP29,500, which she intends to use to buy more stock for her general store, feed for her piggery, and fertilizer for their sugarcane farm.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 tala or US $42 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Lemau joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Lemau's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Lemau L. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.5 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.87 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

She is 46 years old and a mother to four sons. She is education-oriented and makes sure her four children attend school regularly. Two of her children are college students, one is at high school, and the youngest is at elementary school. Rosemarie is married to Ricardo B., a barber and a supportive husband.\r\n<br>Rosemarie is busy retailing a variety of small items, a business she finds very productive. She learned the business from experience and using her own initiative in dealing with costumers. The proceeds of her business are a big help to the family, especially in meeting the educational needs of the children. Now Rosemarie is requesting a loan of 19,000 PHP from Kiva partner, ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.). She will use the loan to buy volume stocks of different goods for her retail business.\r\n<br>Rosemarie's ambition is that her four children will be able to finish their schooling with a degree and find stable jobs. She and her husband have also a great dream of investing in a piece of land and building a house of their own. They have rented for almost 15 years now, which is why it is hard for them to save money. Rosemarie is hoping that, with ASHI's support, there is a big possibility that they can fulfill their

She is 32 years old, married, and the mother of 3 children who are 13, 7, and 2 years old.  The oldest go to school.  She repeated the 6th grade after having left school to get married.  She lives in her own home with her family, and her husband is a carpenter.  She supports her parents by sending them money in order to help out with family costs.\r\n\r\nShe has never left Maputo Province; she has lived and worked in Boane District since she was young.  She has had her own business for over 7 years.  She doesn't have any assistants, but rather counts on the help of her husband, who works about 10 hours each day.  She sells capulanas (traditional colorful skirts) and sometimes even travels to Swaziland to do this.  With this work, she earns about 6,000 MZN each month, which she uses for household costs.  She even saves some through Xitique (a traditional rotating savings system).\r\n\r\nShe has never had loans with other banks.  She found out about Hluvuku through neighbors who are also clients of the institution.  This is her third loan, which has a value of 25,000 MZN.  She plans to use this loan to buy products (capulanas and len\u00e7os, or headwraps) in order to increase her supply and diversify her merchandise.  The previous loans were for 7,000 MZN and 18,000 MZN, both for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHer objective is to diversify the products she sells in order to satisfy her customers and increase her income.  In the future, she would like to ask for more loans in order to open a hairdressing salon.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

Because of her honesty and dedication, her colleagues have made her the treasurer of the group's board of directors. \r\n\r\nNine years ago, Bertha began selling fire extinguishers and offering a fumigation service, working from her home.  Initially, she worked for another company, where she honed her management skills.  Little by little, she gained confidence and decided to become independent.  Everything went well from the start, thanks to her effort and enthusiasm. She has been using her earnings to pay pay for her daughters' education, as well as to build and improve her house.

J. is 42 years old and married with three children. For 29 years he has been running a business of beekeeping, which he originally started because he had difficulties finding employment. The collaborative effort of his family has been the key to his business' growth and he now has a steady customer base due to the quality of his products. Currently, Abdulla is seeking a loan of 5000 Somoni that he wishes to use to expand his business and allow him to offer better products. Abdulla and his family sincerely thanks you for your support in becoming a part of their achievements. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Thus the loan will be used to purchase a natural gas system so that he will be able to enhance his income. \r\n\r\nPastor tells us that he wants to do as much as he can for his spouse and children and so the next loan request he makes will be for improving the condition of the house where they live. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Margaret Wolfe-Roberts, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":583177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a natural gas system for his vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Tarija","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-21.535486 -64.729557","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-08-14T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pastor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172093532},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177385334},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182523386},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188657896},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191401137},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":83.35,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195819454}],"funded_date":"2010-08-16T20:36:25Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:33:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meg Wolfe-Roberts","image":555476}},{"id":226476,"name":"Floreliza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Floreliza C. is a single woman who lives in Sitio Saksak, Barangay Buanoy, Balamban, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures, a sari-sari (variety) store and a food vending business. \r\n\r\nFloreliza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past ten loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Floreliza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 20,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of $135, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase additional products for her sari-sari store business so that she can continue to save up for the future and for a down payment on a 50 square meter lot and for house repair. Floreliza C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable).

The happily married mother of three likes to put smiles on people's faces. \r\n\r\nShe says getting into people's good graces is the key to maintaining good relationships, not only in business but in the other aspects of life. Striking the right impression in a client's mind as she transacts her pig sales business is what she considers her pivotal precept. Four years is the time she has been showing forth her worth, diligence and shrewdness in a business venture predominately run by men.\r\n\r\nNorah, like many other enterprising young women in Uganda, is breaking that false stereotype about the inability of women in Uganda and the rest of Africa to run businesses such as these. She says she now knows the checkered experiences that come with running a business. She says in the near future, she will also confidently call herself a master at business.\r\n\r\nHer first business was a retail shop, which she still operates. After much stock taking and consultations with friends and family, she decided she would have a crack at a pig sales business.\r\n \r\nShe has been making lots of headway in her business owing to the high demand for pork in Mukono Town, where she operates. The fact that she handles at least 10 to 25 clients a week is one of her business's selling points.\r\n\r\nNorah has in this short period made tremendous strides. She anticipates further growth of her business once she gets this loan. She says once she expands her pig sales business to other areas like Kampala, she will be able to make more sales profits.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the face of it, it is a decision she has never lived to regret. Weekly she says this business generates her profits to the tune of UGX 85,000. \r\n\r\nNorah says with proceeds from this Kiva loan, she is going to purchase more piglets. Her plan is to nurture these piglets so that they grow sturdy and she can sell them at a higher price to her clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":783344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more piglets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mukono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.25 32.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-06-03T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dezilanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Molly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":650000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":650001,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T08:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":657306.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222022706},{"amount":275,"local_amount":649999,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":657303.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227248881},{"amount":550,"local_amount":1300001,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-22T09:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1314611.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868438},{"amount":275,"local_amount":649998,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:22:44Z","rounded_local_amount":657302.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648284},{"amount":275,"local_amount":650001,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:12Z","rounded_local_amount":657306.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313659}],"funded_date":"2011-06-03T17:32:06Z","paid_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":308437,"name":"Eoun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eoun is 37 years old and resides with husband and children at Ta Keo province.

He is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. Jamal has a project  raising sheep and benefiting from the sale of their products. He wants to expand his project by purchasing more sheep in order to increase his income by selling more products. As he doesn't have enough money to pay for them, he needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Jamal gets the loan, he will be able to purchase more sheep and sell more products, thus increasing and improving his income to provide his family with better living conditions. Jamal is photographed in the picture.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She doesn't have a fixed schedule.  When she receives the orders, she works from her home to make the blankets, and it takes a long time to produce a finished product, sometimes all day.  She likes her job since she can make the most of her talents as an artist and can work from home.

Kuziboy has been in the farming business for 22 years. It is through farming that he was able to provide for his family and send his children to school, even though they were not able to earn a college degree. Kuziboy would like to request a loan of 4500 Somoni to buy necessary farm inputs like seeds and fertilizers, as they are very expensive. He is very optimistic that this will improve his yield and he hopes to have a continuous partnership with the lenders. Kuziboy always makes sure that he respects the people around him because he believes that respect begets respect.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of Alexander the Great's rule.  It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes,  is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and to a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Antique is located on the island of Panay, which is situated in the west-central part of the Philippine archipelago. People say Antique is where \"the mountains meet the sea\"; its economy revolves around fishing and farming.\r\n\r\nMary Grace and her husband, Julito, raise carabao and cattle. Carabao--a kind of water buffalo that many consider to be the national animal--are usually used as farm work animals, and they also produce milk. Mary Grace plans to use this loan to buy two head of carabao, two head of cattle, and food supplements for her livestock. Besides livestock, Mary Grace also earns income by selling fruits and vegetables, and charcoal for cooking.\r\n\r\nMary Grace has five daughters and three sons; the youngest is six, and the oldest is 28. Her oldest daughter has a college education, and so far is the only one of her children to attain that level of education. Mary Grace says she hopes to be able to continue to support her children's education, and hopes they all find stable jobs so they can become independent and be happy. She also dreams of having enough money to be able to build a more durable house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":305761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She has worked as an administrative assistant in the local primary school for 9 months and has a monthly salary of 2,373 meticais.  Due to her living expenses, she is saving some money along the other members of her bank.  She learned about Hluvuku-Adsema through other members and neighbors.  Her first two loans were for 1,500 and 1,800 meticais so she could purchase products (household appliances).  She has has two loans from other institutions (for construction materials to build a house out of bricks).  She paid them back without any problems and barely complained about the high interest rate.  With this current credit of 10,000 meticais, she will continue with construction on her home and will buy cement and other materials to finalize it.

With the money she is currently requesting, she plans to purchase materials she needs to continue providing her services. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":414950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of products for work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-27T05:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.5,"local_amount":238.58,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:38Z","rounded_local_amount":238.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843109},{"amount":170.06,"local_amount":485.89,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":486.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734687},{"amount":6.77,"local_amount":19.34,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":19.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124076},{"amount":96.86,"local_amount":276.75,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":277.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959758},{"amount":167.81,"local_amount":479.44,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":479.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717394}],"funded_date":"2009-10-27T13:44:50Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":152028,"name":"Chhay","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chhay S. was born in 1957; she is married and blessed with four children.

He is married and has three children. All family expenses (rent, food, education, health, utilities) fall on his shoulders and amount to 225,000 francs a month. The family is living from hand to mouth, such that four people sleep in a single room. \r\n\r\nHis day begins very early, at 6:30 am, and sometimes he works through the night when it is a big holiday. He repairs broken sewing machines and also buys new or used machines from wholesalers and then resells them retail to tailors. He has also managed to open a little sewing notions shop which he has  his little sister manage. His business has real opportunities to succeed since the market for tailored goods is very big and there is plenty of demand, in his own locality and elsewhere. \r\n\r\nThis is why he is asking for a loan of 350,000 francs to grow his stock of merchandise by buying in particular four sewing machines, some thread, and accessories. He has never asked for a loan from IMCEC even though he has been a member since 2008. \r\n\r\nThe profit from this loan will allow him to add to his stock and diversify the products in his sewing notions business and get into selling spare parts for sewing machines. He will also be able to deal better with family expenses, which are quite a burden for him (rent, food, education, etc.)\r\n\r\nHis ambition is  to generate enough income to get into importing sewing materials and supplies. He dreams of building a house for his family to live in. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":800282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"tp buy sewing machines, thread, and accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2011-06-28T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":29166.67,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":29612.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227123275},{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":29166.67,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:18:05Z","rounded_local_amount":29612.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232885186},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":29166.67,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:27:22Z","rounded_local_amount":29612.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238703311},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":29166.67,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":29612.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244660479},{"amount":516.67,"local_amount":233333.32,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":236903.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250881203}],"funded_date":"2011-06-30T13:11:02Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T11:29:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":316648,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a widow selling clothes and underwear at Kokoado, a village near Elmina in Cape Coat.

With the help of these loans, they are able to solve problems that their salaries alone cannot solve.

She lives with El\u00edas, who is a cook.  They live together next to her sister and her two-year-old son, in her own home.  \r\n\r\nThe business Luz has is selling general groceries, so she opened a grocery store in her own house.  She learned the business from her father, who had his grocery store in his house, and with financial help from MFP.  She began her business buying small quantities of products, in this way managing to grow during these four years she has been operating, which up to the present she does alone.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it allows her to be at home to be able to take care of her young child, as well as the economic income that serves her to buy what she needs for her home.  Nevertheless, she does not like that some of her customers ask her for credit and then get behind when it comes time to pay.  Even so she continues with her job.  But her goal is to grow as a merchant and expand her grocery store until she converts it into a store where she can sell all types of products.\r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with the MFP institution, and she hopes for your collaboration so she can realize her plans.  She also comments that she feels good about her communal bank because she knows the majority of the members, although there are still some new ones joining.

For Sunadi raising pigs does not require a lot of energy. Important is capital and persistant for her to expand the business. Her last sales was Rp1,950,000 (about US$220) from sales of 2 pigs, that she raised for 5 months with a capital of Rp750,000 (about $82.50) for feed expense, and Rp400,000 (about $44) for feedstock. Sunadi's profit was Rp800,000 (about $88). Sunadi plans to expand her business by obtaining a loan from Dinari for Rp1,500,000 (about $165), which will be used to buy 4 piglets, since 2 parts of her stall are now empty, because the pigs were sold to pay for Final exams expenses of her child I Putu Pande Kartika Yasa, who finished Mechanical Middle School.

Her work will include distributing Nutriflour (a vitamin-enriched flour produced by K-MET) to malnourished patients, providing reproductive health education, referring patients to local clinics and hospitals, and providing basic health care. <p>\r\n\r\nMerit was diagnosed with HIV several years ago. For a time she was sick at home, but when she began to feel better she talked with her friends about how to live with HIV. Her friends recommended that she start a business so that she could keep busy and be active. In 2005 Merit began a business selling chips (french fries) in the Nyalenda neighborhood of Kisumu.<p>\r\n\r\nMerit chose chips because her parents used to have a similar business and she grew up knowing how to cook and sell chips profitably. Merit purchases about 10 kilograms of potatoes from the Kibuye Market in Kisumu weekly. On a busy day she can sell about half her stock.<p>\r\n\r\nBecause she has this business, Merit is able to provide for herself and to eat what she wants. She says she doesn\u2019t need to rely on anyone else. <p>\r\n\r\nMerit has applied for her first loan from K-MET, of approximately $275. She plans to use this money towards purchasing a machine to fry the chips. If she has a machine, the chips will cook faster and then Merit will not lose customers to long waiting times. Merit would also like to purchase a fridge so that she can sell cold soda with the chips.

She is married and has given birth to six children: three sons and three daughters. Fati tells us her two youngest children are currently in school and the rest are married and live independently with their spouses. Fati lives with her husband and their two younger children in a rented apartment in a commercial town called Bekwai, close to Obuasi, a gold-mining town in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The majority of the inhabitants of Bekwai engage in commercial activities.\r\n<p>\r\nFati trades in fresh yam to earn some income to support her husband and cater for the family.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Fiaaveifo has many years of experience in this business.  Fiaaveifo needs a loan of WST $1450 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 160 tala or US $67 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fiaaveifo joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fiaaveifo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fiaaveifo L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

With this loan, she will obtain fertilizers for her bean crops since she will harvest them very soon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":618479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Comprar fertilizantes para cuidar su cultivo de habas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-17T16:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nery ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718190}],"funded_date":"2010-10-17T17:36:15Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":242905,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick is 41 years old.

She has 3 children, the two oldest work independently and the youngest is the last child of her companion of 3 years, Jerem\u00edas; they live together in Alto Yapas. The time she spends working with her husband in agriculture are profitable at harvest time; they grow coffee, citrus fruit and plantains on their own land, and have done so for the last 3 years. Her children help her bring in the harvest, and she pays them 20 soles per day.  She enjoys clearing the cropland and weeding, allowing the fruit crops to develop.  She finds it difficult to transport the harvest, package it and get it to markets in cities such as Lima and Huancayo. Delia has now begun selling coffee beans to an export company, and now plans to acquire more land to put into coffee cultivation. She has also established a small general store in her house, and hopes to improve its conditions in the future. Delia is a member of the communal lender \u201cLos progresistas\u201d, and this loan will be her third with MFP, so she is familiar with the group's credit terms.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <p>\r\nThus, SELFINA works for the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":173122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand her range of lipsticks, eyeshadows and perfumes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-06-23T12:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-08T13:09:38Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-08-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":290062},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-09-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":320419},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-10-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-19T07:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":352666},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:27:31Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347806},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970378},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886612},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435897},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:29Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130202},{"amount":34.99,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027035},{"amount":35.01,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613075}],"funded_date":"2008-06-24T13:09:38Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":57688,"name":"Aquiles","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Aquiles is 51 years old, he is a single father of 2 students.

With the money from the loan, she will buy material for the crafts and in the future, she wants to expand her business, to support the culture of her town.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sofia Burt, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":214676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase materials to make local crafts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-24T06:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-07T11:26:52Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:16:56Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957437},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227687},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422922},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116146},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011106},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594710},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989241},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210574},{"amount":33.36,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":103.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640278}],"funded_date":"2008-10-24T10:26:52Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sofia Burt","image":1306467}},{"id":74091,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 40-year-old Flora N. from Mwanza, a beautiful city on the shores of Lake Victoria. (Lake Victoria is famous not only because it is one of the largest lakes in the world, but also because it feeds the Nile River, a very important source of life for Africa.) Flora is married and has one child who is 17 years old.  \r\n<p>\r\nSince 2007 Flora has been selling traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called vitenge. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print that is printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile--the various colors, patterns, writings, and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. Flora works at the business 9 to 12 hours a week, 6 days a week. She is requesting a loan of $400  in order to purchase additional vitenge in bulk for resale. Flora thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":224950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional vitenge in bulk for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T02:00:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T09:04:37Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970753},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886970},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436230},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:38Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130502},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:49Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027299}],"funded_date":"2008-11-13T18:33:15Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Olson","image":null}},{"id":78187,"name":"Gulinor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulinor P.  is 60 years old.

She is married and the mother of five kids. She lives in Bekwai zongo community with her husband. Her husband is a security man for a company. Zongo in Ghana is a place which is dominated by Muslims.\r\n\r\nShe is a local manufacturer of palm kernel oil. Palm kernel oil is produced from palm kernels. The palm kernel is a by-product of palm oil. The palm kernel is processed through various stages to obtain the palm kernel oil, which is used to prepare many local dishes like frying fish, local soaps and pastries. She produces and supplies to food vendors to prepare their meals. However, her production is on the low side as a result of low working capital to afford a machine for the processing. She wants to use the loan to buy more bags of palm kernel, and an electric milling machine to reduce the drudgery of using manual labour to help produce larger quantities.

They named their group Frozen Fish Mongers, picking a name that reflects their trade. They are all local entrepreneurs in Makeni in northern Sierra Leone. This is not their first loan from Kiva through SMT. They all previously received several loans from Kiva through SMT. Each member of the group received a loan of Le 1,200,000 during the last loan cycle. That loan created meaningful impacts in the lives of these borrowers. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees.  They\u2019re also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans.  Today, they are requesting a loan of Le 1,300,000 each to buy more cartons of frozen fish to add to their businesses.\r\n<p>\r\nKadiatu (back row, right) is the leader of the group. She is forty-five years of age. She was born in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone. She is married to a businessman and the couple has four children. Two of her children are in college and two are in secondary schools. Kadiatu has been a businesswoman for over twenty years now.\r\n<p> \r\nKadiatu, like the rest of the group members, sells frozen fish. With this new loan, she will expand her business. She will be able to buy about ten cartons of frozen fish. She usually travels to Freetown to buy the fish. The fare to Freetown is Le 12,000 and she usually pays a delivery fee of Le 1,000 per carton.

She is starting a business venture, sewing different kinds of clothes and dresses .  Matelani needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase a new sewing machine.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 125 tala or US $52 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Matelani joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Matelani's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Matelani R. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2.1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He is 43 years old and is from the city of Anta. He lives with his partner and 3 children. His principal economic activity is providing personal security. He works for the Ministry of the Interior as a trusted personal assistant to a public functionary. He has been doing this for 8 years and has done very well, thanks to the effort he puts into his work. He also has a complementary economic activity - breeding, buying and selling small animals such as guinea pigs. Julio has a small shed at his house where he has 40 female guinea pigs. \r\n\r\nJulio Cesar is a very hard-working and empresarial person who is always looking for ways to move forward. By working hard each day he wants to give his children a better future. He requires a loan to expand his shed and purchase a breed of guinea pigs. Julio tells us with great sadness that the humidity has affected his guinea pigs, and a considerable quantity have died. Notwithstanding the adversities of the climate, he will continue with the business. \r\n\r\nJulio's yearning is to expand his business, buying guinea pigs in quantity to sells them during important festivals, such as the city of Cusco's anniversary. He would also like to open a restaurant selling typical food from the region, such as 'Chiriuchu'.

They help each other out tending to their pineapple crops, which they plant on rented land since he doesn\u2019t have the necessary means to buy his own.\r\n\r\nDespite the difficulties he has faced, he managed to educate and support his family.  In addition, he tells us that 10 years ago he embarked on creating a coffee plant nursery (a cultivation technique used to obtain a grow a good crop), in which he must invest a great deal of funds.  To date, he averages 100 thousand saplings, obtaining a profit of 10 to 30 thousand soles.  Everything depends on the orders he manages to obtain.  Things are going well for him and, while he has the strength, he will continue to work hard to save so he can buy land for his children to inherit.  \r\n\r\nHe belongs to \u201cThe Progressives\u201d cooperative bank, and this is his first loan with MFP.  He hopes to obtain a good result thanks to the collective support of his association.  Jorge has an order for one thousand saplings, which is why he will purchase coffee seeds with the requested loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":773695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy coffee plant seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-22T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1031.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385340}],"funded_date":"2011-05-22T23:55:24Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":304388,"name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e8bou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e8bou N. est une veuve de 37 ans et m\u00e8re de cinq enfants qui vit avec ses enfants chez son d\u00e9funt \u00e9poux \u00e0 Wayerma I, un des  quartiers populaires de la ville de Sikasso.\nDj\u00e9n\u00e8bou N. m\u00e8ne des activit\u00e9s diverses et vari\u00e9es : achat et vente des draps de lits,  de pagnes wax et  des chargements de bois de chauffe depuis plus de quatre  ans.

50 years old.  He lives in the town of Vanadzor.  Samvel's wife works as a teacher at a secondary school, oldest son attends the Yerevan State Medical University, and the youngest son attends school.  Samvel has been involved in carpentry for over 10 years.  He re-purposed one of the rooms in his house into a workshop, where he makes products from wood.  Samvel accepts orders for making furniture and sells wooden souvenirs in a leased space at the city department store.  He also sells table clocks and paintings from Yerevan there.  Samvel's products stand out due to its high quality, taste and mastery.  He cuts very difficult ornaments on the furniture and backgammon, which is why he always has new orders.  This business allows Samvel to support his family and pay for his oldest son's education.  In order to increase his family's income, Samvel wants to start selling ceramic dishwares, vases, statuettes, etc.  He needs a loan in the sum of 1,000,000 dram for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":873182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cContext: The project is located in Oussouye in the south of Senegal.  It comprises women who work together to improve their living conditions and those of their families.  Oussouye is known for its tourism, which is why local commerce to provide the hotels with foodstuffs is the principal business activity.\r\n<p>\r\nPurpose:  The objectives of the group include increasing the income of its members, alleviating the burden of the housewife, and improving the living conditions of its members.\r\n<p>\r\nBusiness activities:  In order to carry out its business properly, the group is requesting a loan to allow it to purchase merchandise in the markets of nearby towns such as Ziguinchor, Bignona and Kolda, in order to satisfy the local demand for these goods.\u201d \r\n<p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n<p>\r\n<b> Business description translated from French by Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance Fund. <\/b>\r\n<p>\r\n\u00abContexte : Le projet se situ \u00e0 Oussouye au sud du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal ;

She and her husband Jomarie agreed to get a loan from ASHI in order to attain her aspiration in life.  In 2007, Jinalyn joined ASHI. That year, she only received PHP5,000 loan. After two years of  maintaining her good performance in ASHI such as a good repayment record and a good attendance in center meetings, she is now qualified to apply for a loan in a higher amount.\r\n\r\nJust recently, Jinalyn applied for a loan from ASHI amounting to PHP14,000. This loan will be used as additional capital for  the business she had been doing since the time she joined ASHI - her buy and sell  fish business. \r\n\r\nThrough the opportunity Jinalyn receives from ASHI, she believes that her loan will not only enhance her business and child's education but also will provide her family a secured house.

He is married and is a father of 6 children.  His wife is not employed.  She stays at home, does domestic work and feeds livestock.  Ubaidullo is involved in feeding and selling livestock.  Summer time for Ubaidullo is the season for purchasing livestock because livestock and animal feed prices are cheaper during the summer.  And he does not need to spend very much on feeding livestock.  Livestock eats mountain grass, allowing Ubaidullo to save on livestock feed.  At the onset of winter, Ubaidullo sells some of the fed livestock, but he does not buy new livestock.  He buys animal feed for the remaining livestock.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":354818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Livestock feeding and sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ubaidullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":127355,"name":"Almira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Almira C., 33, lives with her husband Elvin, 32, a family driver, and their two grade school children in the heart of a joyful community in Maricaban, Pasay City.\r\n\r\nAlmira owns a general store located just in front of her house.

loving and hardworking mother who continuously works for the betterment of her family: this is Fely V.. She is 45 years old and married to Jun V. who is a tricycle driver and who also helps his wife to run their business. They have two children who are 19 and 21 years old and are still studying. The family lives in the village of Barangay Mabini, Cadiz City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nThe couple strives really hard to provide for the future of their children. Jun drives the tricycle (a motorcycle with a passenger sidecar) that they own to shuttle passengers around town for a fee. Fely started a general store using recycled lumber for its structure just so she could have a place to setup her business. She knew even then that, once the business became stable, she would be able to start repairs and improve the structure.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two businesses, the couple also wakes up before dawn to buy fish either in the market or in the fishing port and sells it in front of their general store. Fely also started selling coffee and snacks as well as coconut wine adjacent to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Fely joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access additional capital for their expanding businesses. With more capital, she was able to increase her monthly income to PHP 20,000 on the average, providing their family with a more comfortable living and enabling her to make improvements to her store and house and have some left for savings.\r\n\r\nFely borrowed PHP 29,500 on her previous loan which she used as additional capital in her general store business. She paid all of her weekly installments in full without any delays within her loan term. She now is borrowing the same amount of PHP 29,500 to use as working capital for her business. The income from it will be used to support the family's household needs. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":403906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

However, because of poverty and low income, she somehow understands the reason for her children\u2019s decision.\r\n\r\nInstead of succumbing to frustrations and disappointments, Mary Jane wants to grow her husband\u2019s fishing business so as to increase the volume of fish she directly sells to people in their village and in the neighboring villages. Through this, their income will be increased and she will be able to support the education of her three youngest children until they graduate from college.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting now is the greatest opportunity for her to change the pattern of life of her three remaining children.

For about a year he has worked manufacturing refrigerators and ice chests, among other appliances. He has a large client base because he is known for the well-finished products that he makes.  He likes his job because he is accustomed to hard work and because he earns good income, which is enough to support his three children who are his reason for living.  Currently Pablos works with a group of colleagues who offer the same services but in the future he wishes to open his own shop.  The group is very united but Pablo thinks a lot about his family and providing them with a better future, so he wants to become independent and launch his own, individual business.  This is his second loan with MFP and he promises to be punctual and responsible as he was previously.  With the money from this loan he wants to buy tools and machinery to start his own business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary McKee, Kiva

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting breadfruit for sale.  Merenaite has many years of experience in this business.  Merenaite needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 180 tala or US $75 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Merenaite joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Merenaite's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Merenaite F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.89 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical vegetable garden in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/VegetableGarden#\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:
