Zohirjon is 30 years old and lives with his wife and 4 children. He has been a farmer for 10 years, since the time of his marriage. This work enables him to support his family and it is for this reason that he works so hard and with such determination. \r\n<P>\r\nZohirjon enjoys planting tomato and onion on his land and he likes harvesting even more because this is when he can see and appreciate the high quality of his products. In general, the production of tomato and onion in his area is good and there is great demand for them. The most difficult part of the business is planting season, especially with the cost of fertilizers that are necessary for good yield. This is Zohirjon\u2019s first loan through IMON International. He plans to purchase seeds and fertilizer for his crop. \r\n<P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<P>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying assorted cosmetic products and brand name clothes.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will grow so that she can have enough resources for her children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He is married and is the father of two children, a 9-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son.  The daughter is in elementary school, and the son is in preschool.  Aside from the children, he is responsible for his mother and a nephew who live with him, and he does not manage to save anything because he is still building his house and cannot count on help from his wife, who is unemployed.\r\n\r\nIsaac completed school but did not attend college for financial reasons.  After a year he got into teaching school, which he completed in two years and was employed in Boane.  Because he was far from home and his family, he asked for a transfer to the town of Namaacha where he now teaches physical education in the mornings and math in the afternoons, earning 5,560 meticais per month.  Six months after the transfer his salary of 35,000 meticais was paid retroactively, and he began building his own house.  Because the price of materials rose, he could not finish the plastering and some parts of his veranda.  He first approached Hluvuku asking for a loan of 12,000 meticais to buy a gas oven and a set of sofas, and he paid it off with no problems.\r\n\r\nThis is Isaac's third loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva.  The first loan of 12,000 meticais was used to buy the oven and sofas.  The second loan, for 6,000 meticais, was used to buy construction material, and this third loan of 15,000 meticais will be used for plastering and for finishing the veranda which he must have because of the climate.  He is confident that he will pay the loan off ahead of schedule and ask for a new loan to pay for further education.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

She earns her living by operating a pig fattening business and a fishing business. Her husband Jerry, who is 46 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are between 13 and 20 years old. Sandra joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sandra has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion and her children's education. Sandra is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

speak the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mixtec\" target=\"_blank\" >Mixtec<\/a> language.  They say that they chose this name for their group because they identify themselves according to their beliefs and traditions.  All of them are from the same community and are hard workers who are of indigenous descent.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the group is Sra. Olivia, who sells utensils of the Tupperware brand.  She travels to neighboring towns in order to offer her merchandise.  Olivia has been in business for approximately four years.  She says that she started out selling Arabela products (a line of cosmetics and personal care products), but she was not able to generate good profits because the people in her town rarely use makeup.  In addition, she sold very little in the neighboring towns so she decided to sell utensils through catalogs.  She accepts payments in three weekly installments.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Ol\u00ed, as she is called by the other members of her group, has been happily married to Sr. Alfonso (Poncho) for 34 years.  Don Poncho helps his wife sell on the weekends when they travel to the neighboring towns.  Whenever they visit relatives, they bring merchandise to offer to them.  They have three children, two daughters and a son.  Michel is 12 years old, Miriam is 9 years old, and little Alfonso Dami\u00e1n is 5 years old.  Do\u00f1a Ol\u00ed is requesting a loan in order to buy utensils such as wash basins, containers, glasses, and frying pans.  She is pleased with the opportunity that Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad has given her so that she can continue her business and make it larger.  Olivia is also grateful that the organization is assisting all of the members so that they can fulfill their dreams of growing and helping their families.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe other members of the group are as follows:\r\n\u2022\tFeliciana sells fish.\r\n\u2022\tFloribertha sells food.\r\n\u2022\tPatricia Juana sells food.\r\n\u2022\tEmma sells chickens.\r\n\u2022\tJer\u00f3nimo Rolando sells fruits and legumes.\r\n\u2022\tJer\u00f3nimo Francisco sells fruits and vegetables.\r\n\u2022\tReina sells cheese.\r\n\u2022\tReyna Matilde sells food.\r\n<p>\r\nThey thank Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for helping people from small towns who want to succeed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":927839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase household utensils.

This activity means that his wife is not able to help with the housework.  A professional driver, Mr. F. takes his passengers from Aklakou, his town, to Lome, the capital city, in his taxi whose motor has fallen into disrepair. Educated all the way to Secondary School, Mr. Teko has 15 years experience in his profession. In order for him to re-launch his business, he needs a good quality car. This is why he is asking for a loan of $1,200.00, to purchase a new motor and to replace certain parts. With these repairs, he and his family can re-find the joy of life and to meet their nutritional, schooling and sanitary needs. <p>Translated from French by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9 \u00e0 Aklakou en 1968, Monsieur F.

Ergashali has been a farmer from the start, having inherited his lands \u2013 and the occupation \u2013 from his parents. With the passing of time, he has also implemented raising livestock into his enterprise. Each day, he takes his cows to graze in the far reaches of his fields. \r\n\r\n<p>With these activities, he earns income to support the living expenses of his family. He faces difficult times, however, when livestock prices go down and he is not able to earn enough. Ergashali, however, is learning every day how to run his business for the best end result. The constant motivation for his efforts is his family. He is accustomed to these tasks since he has carried them out as he himself grew up. Ergashali seeks a loan for working capital, specifically so he can buy cattle, especially considering that the prices for them are low now. He feels that this is the only way that will enable him to provide all of his children with a good education. Ergashali deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him.

middle-aged man who was born in 1968. He is married and the father of five children. Toshboy buys and sells cattle at the cattle market. He purchases cattle, and either sells them immediately if he can find a good buyer, or within a week or two. Toshboy purchases five or ten head cheaply, then resells them at a markup, thus earning a living and turning over his capital. Toshboy supports his family, and his sons help him. He has been a loan customer at MicroInvest for more than two years, and  always uses his loans purposefully.

There he has created his family with Gregoria, his wife of 10 years.  They have 2 sons, Yerson and Rosmery, who are loved and are educated in their own home.  \r\n\r\nAs an entrepreneurial and very determined young man, he began working in the occupation that his parents taught him: agriculture.  For 10 years, he has demonstrated all his skills in growing coffee, pineapple and cocoa, of which he has now stopped growing coffee.  As a result of fluctuations, a kilo of coffee that previously cost an average of 20 New Soles, is reaching a low at 8 Soles.  For that reason, he no longer engages in growing this product, and so he spends most of his time cultivating pineapple on \u00bd acre of agricultural land.  He has had to rent more land area to produce a greater quantity and so get good profits. \r\n\r\nWhat he likes best about his work is taking his products for sale in the capital, where he can buy various things that are not available in his community. Now he is thinking about putting together enough money to buy more of his own farmland.  He belongs to the communal bank \"La Palmeras\" and this is his first loan through MFP.  He is very glad to know he has the financial support to continue his work.  Nelson, once he has the support, will invest the money requested to buy 4 bags of organic manure to use on his pineapple crop, which is growing smoothly.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":802175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy 4 sacks of organic manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-30T21:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":551.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098506}],"funded_date":"2011-07-01T15:38:26Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":316324,"name":"Jean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jean is 31 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Because she is from rural Kenya, women are left to do the heavy work of farming but this has not been a setback to him because she has been making great profits in farming. Kinoru is one of the places with conditions that favor horticulture farming: good climate, soils, transport system, and market. Rose has always wanted to diversify and start horticultural farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is lack of funds. She is therefore requesting a loan to buy seeds and start horticultural farming. Rose joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance organization that supports young and enterprising farmers. With your loan Rose intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers and potatoes. Proximity to an airstrip will allow her to transport the produce faster to an international market, hence enabling her to make more money. This loan will improve Rose's living conditions and secure the future of her children.\nRose is working really hard to make her farming sustainable. She expects that through her farming she can make her dreams come true, like building a modern house and paying tuition fees for her children.

G. was born in Atchantidom\u00e9 on December 31, 1962.

Well-known for his welcoming and sympathetic personality, he currently manages his little pharmacy, which he hopes to bolster.  Given the level of demand from his customer base, which continues to grow, he hopes to weave relationships with laboratories and thus to resupply his shop with medicines.

During this time of vacations, the price of school supplies has diminished a little, and he wishes to take advantage of this chance to stock up on books and notebooks before school starts.  To do so, he is requesting this loan to buy 5 boxes of notebooks and 80 books for primary school.  He will thus be able to earn a good income.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\nMonsieur A.

After a number of failures, she decided to prepare and sell local non-alcoholic drinks three years ago.  She has many customers and is well known.  She joined the program three years ago and has received three group loans and one individual loan from Soro Yiriwaso.  She has fully repaid all previous loans.  This is her second individual loan and she will use it to buy three bags of sugar, a motor for her refrigerator and two cartons of powdered juice.  She buys her ingredients locally in S\u00e9gou.  Hawa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 sells both for cash and on credit to her customers, men and women.\r\n\r\nShe expects to make a monthly profit of 45,000 FCFA which she will use to pay the interest on the loan and her children's tuition.  Her goal is to diversify her business by selling calabashes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Laure Kwon, Kiva

In the photo she is bravely raising her arm. \r\nShe is an excellent customer of the Uamsho credit association, and is a 44 year old widowed mother of three (two boys and a girl).  Her elder son is studying in his second year (bac exam year), the second pulled out of his studies, and the youngest is in the third year of primary school. Manda W. lives in the outer quarter of Majengo, a shanty town in Goma. \r\n\r\nHer husband was a victim of the 1996 war and so-called 'liberation' of the AFDL (Alliance of Democratic Force for the Liberation of the Congo), a military-political movement led by the former president Laurent D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila who overturned the dictatorial power of president Mobutu Seseseko, \r\n\r\n'Rutuku' is an alcoholic beverage made from a mixture of fermentations and manioc flour, corn, sorghum etc that are heated to over 180 degrees C, then passed through a flask connected to a chimney outlet made locally. The refined drops are then collected in a flask and cooled in order to create a strong whiskey-like taste that is appreciated greatly by her customers. \r\n\r\nManda W. began her business activity with $30 of her own money, which went towards the production and sale of doughnuts (Ndazi). Unfortunately the sales of doughnuts were not enough to pay all her family's costs, and so she diversified her business and started to sell the local drink. In addition to this, she sells Primus beer and Fanta to boost her revenue.  \r\n\r\nShe would use a loan to purchase 2 bags of sugar, 15 packs of yeast (for the production of doughnuts), one bag of corn, two bags of manioc flour, 4 heaps of firewood (for the production of the drink), etc.  She has explained that the major challenge in producing the drink is to do with credit sales. But also, sometimes if the ingredients have not been well mixed, her customers do not like the drink that is produced and refrain from buying it. \r\n\r\nShe has already bought a plot of land for her son and aims to build a house on it. She would also like her son to marry the woman with whom he has two children, in order for her dowry to be split among the family. \r\n\r\nThe Uamsho group is made up of 13 women. Manda W. is grateful to Hekima IMF for the loans that she will receive, as with these loans she will be able to see to her fatherless children's needs. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":558557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"two bags of sugar, 15 packs of yeast (for doughnuts), one bag of corn, two bags of manioc flour , four heaps of firewood (for production of the drink) etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling health & medicinal products in the local community. Josefina has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Josefina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josefina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 16,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Josefina is requesting a new loan of 18,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 9th loan taken out by Josefina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They have three children who are between 6 to 16 years old. \r\n\r\nElsa joined Kiva partner NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elsa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 27,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, lifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000, which she intends to use to buy piglets, chickens and a goat to raise so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business and education of her children.\r\n\r\nElsa F. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She calculated, after harvest, her average profit from the sedge is 120 USD. The profit is high, and she also has good material for weaving sedge mats. Currently, the main activity for Mrs. D. and her husband is to weave sedge mats. Their average income is 150 USD\/month.

The seasonal nature her husband's income motivates her more in working her farm, consisting of a small plantation and pig pens. \r\n\r\nKomang earns decent profit from her pig farm that can be used to supplement her family's income.  However, increasing price of feeds makes it difficult for her to breed and farm more pigs.  Therefore she decided to apply for a loan from DINARI to purchase feeds and more piglets.  With the help of 6 month loan, Komang earned additional $110 profit.  \r\n\r\nAfter that result, Komang decided to apply for second loan from DINARI.

Tetapi dengan tingginya harga pakan babi membuat Komang kesulitan mngembangkan ternak babinya. Oleh karena itu Komang memutuskan untuk ikut program DINARI dengan meminjam dana yang digunakan untuk membeli bibit dan pakan babi. Dari pinjaman selama 6 bulan tersebut Komang mendapatkan keuntungan sebesar Rp. 1000.000,-.\r\n\tMelihat hasil itu Komang melanjutkan pinjaman dengan DINARI ke periode kedua.

She began her business by selling traditional napkins in the market in San Juan Sacatep\u00e9quez. Over time the demand from her customers grew larger and she saw the need for more capital in order to buy spools of thread. <P>\r\n\r\nToday she not only makes napkins, but also cloths used to carry babies, tablecloths, and scarves. Isabel feels the effects of the economic situation, but is happy that her customers continue to place orders. She says that the cost of thread has risen and that she needs more capital to purchase the necessary materials for her work. <P>\r\n\r\n For this reason she is requesting a loan to be able to meet customer demand and to continue making sales and growing her business. Her dream is to have a big store in the market that sells all different types of weavings. She will continue struggling and pushing forward to provide for her family just as she has always done.<P>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Bouch, Kiva Fellow<b\/><P>\r\n\r\nPara Do\u00f1a Isabel la elaboraci\u00f3n de tejidos a la que se dedica ha sido el regalo de su madre ya que fue ella quien le ense\u00f1\u00f3 este oficio.

Through primary and secondary school and up through advanced studies to the present, he has acquired a solid experience in earning a living. Kalobwe's first business was selling lamp kerosene, a business he began in 1978 with a starting capital of US$ 1 when he was still in second grade. From 1978 to 1988, Kalobwe worked hard and practiced good management which allowed him to accumulate profit that he used to diversify his business, adding the sale of charcoal and smoked fish. <P>\r\n\r\nIn 1988 he had a total capital of US$ 200. After having received his official high school diploma in 1988, Kalobwe went to Kinshasa to register for higher studies. From 1989 up to the present, he got into another type of business selling larval caterpillars (as food), which are much in demand  in Kinshasa. His beginning capital for the new business in 1989 was US$ 150.  <P>\r\n\r\nOver the years and using the profit he accumulated, he managed to begin selling other products as well, for example peanuts and purified water. Presently, Kalobwe has a capital of about US$ 1000 and his business is generating a profit of US$ 300 per month. <P>\r\n\r\nWorking with HOPE since July 2008, Kalobwe wants to make his dream come true: opening a little factory making purified water. His business is situated in the north-west district of the city of Kinshasa. He is 43, married and the father of 8 children from 1 year old to 20 years of age. Six of his children are enrolled in school. Kalobwe and his family love their businesses because they provide them with the financial means to solve household problems. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":314644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of bags to pack purified water in for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 29 years old, and a single mother of 2 children aged 6 months and 10.  She attended school through the tenth grade but dropped out due to respiratory problems.  She lives in her own home with her children.  She also supports her mother, who still lives in her native province of Zambezia, by sending money to her at the end of every month.  \r\n\r\nAurea did not grow up with her parents.  When she was still a baby she went to live in the Inhambane province with friends, and later lived in the city of Maputo (in a home left to her).  She does not live with the father of her children.  She lives off the rent she earns from a building that was left to her by her grandfather in the city of Maputo, which she rents out, earning 12.000,00MT monthly.  She is using the money to build a brick home in phases, and to cover family expenses.   \r\n\r\nShe learned to run a business (selling a variety of products) in the city of Maputo, before moving to Boane where she has lived for more than 10 years. \r\n\r\nThis is Aurea's first loan with Hluvuku-Adsema, in the amount of 12.000,00MT.  It will be used to purchase construction materials (cement, sand, etc.) with the goal of completing construction on her home.  Her future plans are to finish her home and build a small store.  To do this she plans to repay the loan without any problems so that she can have access to future loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":393739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchae of construction materials (cement, sand, etc.) ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-27T19:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.58,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aurea Alexandre","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":545.03},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":567.43},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":590.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":615.02},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":640.3},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.61},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":694.01},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":722.53},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":752.22},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":783.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":815.32},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":848.82},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":883.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":920.02},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":957.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":997.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.28},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.06},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.01},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.03},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.57},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.14},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":42.69,"local_amount":1138.36,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:28:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1157.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971847},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":1083.39,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1102.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816785},{"amount":41.68,"local_amount":1111.54,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1130.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708968},{"amount":86.25,"local_amount":2299.96,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2339.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938017},{"amount":47.43,"local_amount":1264.75,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1286.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938018},{"amount":46.35,"local_amount":1290.09,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1312.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.03,"payment_id":136698570},{"amount":95.88,"local_amount":2729.68,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2776.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.48,"payment_id":151915995},{"amount":35.51,"local_amount":1082.23,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1100.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.07,"payment_id":159878446}],"funded_date":"2009-09-27T22:04:02Z","paid_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":143478,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martha is thirty-five years old.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Inosia has 5 years of experience in this business.  Inosia needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 tala or US $63 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Inosia joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Inosia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Inosia P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Married to Rafael G., a vegetable vendor, she is blessed with three children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life. Both of them have been selling vegetables for five years.\n\nAnita has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends the weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently.\n\nBecause of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, Anita was able to borrow four times in CCT\u2019s cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy more vegetables from suppliers. Her business lets her earn a profit of PHP 6,000 per month.\n\nNow, with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business and used to buy assorted vegetables for her vegetable store.\n\nAnita dreams that her business will grow so that they can buy a delivery truck for their produce and prays that God will bless their lives as one family.\n\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":479255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her own house, along with her husband and 4 children. Her business is the sale of bedspreads, sheets, curtains, and electrical home appliances. Whenever her customers ask her for particular products, Diola goes to the wholesale market in the capital to get the products they requested. Sometimes her husband helps her with the purchases so that they can stock greater quantities of products to avoid disappointments when she offers them to her customers. She feels happy with the work that she carries out. So far she has had many customers, and she likes this very much because she knows that this way her earnings will increase. Now her big dream is to set up a shop, and she will try to prepare her house for this, since this way she will not have to neglect her children. This is her eighteenth loan with MFP, and she has promised again to be responsible in making her payments, since she finds this credit so helpful in the progress of her business. With the loan that she is applying for, she will invest in the purchase of a sewing machine to help her daughter who is studying sewing and tailoring."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":607109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"Buy a sewing machine to help her daughter who is studying sewing and tailoring.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T21:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":104.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":109.24},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":113.42},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":119.26},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":123.85},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":129.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.92},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.65},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.99,"local_amount":213.78,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":234.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449981},{"amount":44.55,"local_amount":113.42,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":124.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588680},{"amount":46.86,"local_amount":119.26,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":131.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725182},{"amount":48.65,"local_amount":123.85,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":136.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463274},{"amount":50.95,"local_amount":129.69,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":142.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886679}],"funded_date":"2010-10-04T23:55:18Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":238496,"name":"Rosal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosal B. is from the village of Calamagui.

More than four years ago, she decided to establish her own source of income. She previously worked in a store that sold spare parts for cars, so thanks to the experience she gained there, she decided to open her own spare auto parts store, where she specializes in clutches. Since then, she has been selling spare auto parts from a storefront located in a commercial zone. She has converted part of the space into her home, so she can always take care of her business.\r\n\r\nHer business is currently going very well. She also sells accessories for cars, which has increased her earnings. As a result, she has been able to contract the services of a mechanic who helps install the parts in her customers' cars when needed. Evelyn's greatest dream is to have a well-equipped auto workshop and a much larger space, because she has seen that her business is profitable. She will keep working to achieve this goal.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.

She sells the coffee in the city of La Merced.\r\nRita and Werner have thought to increase their fields and improve their production.

I need to expand my business so that I can save for my children\u2019s future and help them continue with their studies.    \r\nThe other women in my group are: Naila B., Saeeda  B. and Rani B.. All three run boutiques and are borrowing to expand and improve their businesses. These women work very hard to earn an income for their families. We have been together for one year and have learned to be punctual and responsible during this

He is 71 years old, married and he's never had any children. He lives with a few nephews and his wife. He's lived in the city of Matola ever since he was a child. For over 10 years Abubacar has worked in the retail business by running a commercial establishment from 7:00am until 6:00pm. He has one employee. He notes that beer is a good product because he can buy a case of it for 230,00mt and sell it for 300,00mt. His store generates 1500,00mt daily and he is able to save a certain amount from that at the end of every month. He lives in his own home. This will be his first loan from Hluvuku and he has never requested loans from any other financial institution. He intends to pay it off in advance so he can request a second loan that will be invested in making his place of business more attractive by offering a better selection of goods. <br

She has never invested in pigs before; however, her husband has experience in this area and has passed his knowledge on to her.  She feels she can have large profits in this business because of her husband's support.  There is a high demand for yams, both sweet and yellow, in this region of Cameroon; she hopes her yams will fill some of this demand.  She also plans to sell some of the manure from her pigs to people in her community.  <P>\r\n \r\nWith the profits from this loan, Pamela hopes to build a proper pit latrine for her family.  She also hopes to save some money to purchase her own home; her family is currently living with her brother-in-law.  She lost her home due to her brother's debt.

They decided to move the factory to expand it.  Because of this, the workers also moved and so Cristina lost her principal clients.\r\n\r\nSome time later, she also decided to move away from home.  With this move, she saw a source of income if she dedicated herself to the sale of vegetables in the town market.  Because of this, she bought her place four years ago and sells everyday.  A year after beginning this business she thought it would be good if she also took advantage of her time in the afternoon since sometimes the vegetable business is not sufficient. Every afternoon she sells kebabs, grilled chicken, among other dishes, in the principal area near her house.\r\n\r\nShe has been a single mother of 3 kids that are now 20, 18 and 16 years old.

K. is a 42-year-old woman, who is married and has two children. For the past ten years, she and her husband Bahodur Azimov have raised and traded in cattle. Her husband purchases young steers at the cattle market for a low price. Gulnora fattens them for three or four months at home and in the pasture, and then sells them to the butchers for a good price.  This is her way of contributing to the family finances. In addition, her husband earns a living as a taxi driver. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":324212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T03:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1027.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87085023},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1027.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001245}],"funded_date":"2009-06-01T07:03:28Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:35:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":114743,"name":"Mazakhir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mazakhir K. runs a small grocery store, selling a wide variety of foodstuffs, including canned foods, soft drinks, juices, sweets, tea, coffee, etc. He has been in this business for about twelve years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married with 8 adult children. He has been farming for 20 years in Kisii town in Western Kenya. Simion's products are tea, milk and trees, which he sells to Kenya Tea Development Authority and the local market.\r\n\r\nSimion recently completed his previous loan from Juhudi Kilimo.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rachel has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rachel joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rachel is requesting a loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rachel from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She comes from a family of farmers and as a young person tried in many ways to advance herself and to reach for a better life. After graduating from the high school in her region, she entered the university in the nearby city of Cahul, but having had limited financial support from her parents she was unable to finish her studies. \r\n<p>\r\nShe began working as a sales person at the outdoor market as an employee of a business owner. The income which she was receiving was very small and was enough only to meet the most basic needs.

He is married and the father of two children: the first is a 5-year-old daughter who goes to school, and the second is a 1-year-old son.  Belmiro moved with his aunt to Namaacha, a village on the border of Swaziland, to avoid the frequent illnesses to which he had been subject in the Gaza area.  <P>\r\n\r\nBelmiro arrived in Namaacha and was unable to get a spot in school to continue his studies.  The next year, his aunt gave him money to enable him to start his own business.  He began by selling cakes he bought in Swaziland and reselling them next to a soft drink stand at the border.  His business benefited when customs agents decided to shut down the soft drink stand; consequently he started selling soft drinks in addition to cakes and started exchanging currency.  Through this, Belmiro was able to build his own house.  Years later he got together with his wife and left his aunt\u2019s house.  <P>\r\n\r\nLittle by little he built his own shop in his house to augment the family\u2019s income.  His biggest products are wheat flour, which he buys at 20 meticais (MTn) and resells for 28MTn per kilogram; rice, buying at 500MTn and reselling for 625MTn per sack; fish, buying at 350MTn and reselling for 700MTn per plate; and pasta, buying at 200MTn and reselling for 350MTn per box.  He works from 7am to 8pm and earns 6,000MTn monthly.  He is able to save 2,000MTn per month.  In addition to his children, Belmiro takes care of his parents in Gaza, sending them 1,000MTn for basic goods each month.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Belmiro\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku [Kiva\u2019s Field Partner] and his first with Kiva.  He used the first loan, of 15,000MTn, to strengthen his cakes and drinks business and repaid the loan on time.  He is asking for this second loan, of 12,000MTn, to buy merchandise for his shop.  His goal is to grow his shop and request a new loan to purchase a vehicle to facilitate his day-to-day business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

His wife, Mrs. Khum Lay, works in a garment factory and contributes a small salary to the support of the family. Although they work hard, they still cannot support the family well. In order to improve their living conditions, Mr. C. B. decided to ask for a loan to buy a cow to start a breeding business. Mr. C.

They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Mamadali, 68 years old, is married with three children. Mamadali sells dried fruits in the central local market. He has been in this business for 11 years. \r\n<p>\r\nDried fruits are very popular in Tajikistan: any hostess will have dried fruits on hand for serving in case there are guests in the house. Moreover, dried fruits are served as a rule during all family occasions, such as wedding parties, birthday parties, and other events. \r\n<p>\r\nConsidering the constant demand for his goods, Mamadali's business is quite successful and brings in a stable income for the family. Now Mamadali wants to increase the stock of his goods in order to be able to supply all the demands of his buyers. For this purpose, he requests $800 for the term of 9 months. He is going to use the loan to purchase dried fruits, like raisins and apricots, as well as nuts, like almonds and pistachios, with the purpose of increasing his range of goods for sale. \r\n<p>\r\nMamadali has already demonstrated himself to be a dependable client with positive credit history. He would like to thank all for their support and promises to pay the loan in time.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Yourself. She did not have the opportunity to go to school due to poverty. She is involved with the sale of charcoal and has been doing this business for the last 21 years. Her business is located in Paynesville, on the outskirts of Monrovia. She started this business through the help of a family member. She is married with seven children whose ages range from 12-23 years old and are currently in school. She also helps to take care for two siblings.\r\n\r\nThe challenge she faces is that there are so many vendors selling charcoal in the market. Oretha plans to use her 5,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 25,000 Liberian dollar group loan to purchase more charcoal to improve the business. Her goal is to improve her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Oretha is holding the sign.\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.  Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship.  LEAP seeks to help rebuild post-conflict Liberia through its group and individual loans to micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs, and puts emphasis on lending to women.\r\n\r\nJoin the Team LEAP - Liberia lending team on Kiva today: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/community\/viewTeam?team_id=10019\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":524937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more charcoal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Red Light, Paynesville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.5 -9.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":141,"posted_date":"2010-04-16T20:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oretha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Massa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LRD","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1032},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1844},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1840}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.48},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":23.63,"local_amount":1575,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1634.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136711597},{"amount":121.5,"local_amount":8100,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T07:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8403.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144998148},{"amount":121.5,"local_amount":8100,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:43:27Z","rounded_local_amount":8403.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152755722},{"amount":108.37,"local_amount":7225,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":7495.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159667046}],"funded_date":"2010-04-17T00:25:22Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:33:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":197556,"name":"Cristo Vive 1,2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"R.MariaR.
