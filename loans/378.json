She has been working at this activity for one year; it is going very well and she has several orders per week.  Now, she also wants to earn money selling clothes, so that when she goes to buy her bananas, at the same time she will offer her clothing.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Z. is 36 years old, and as a 1 year old daughter. She grows tubers (potatoes, oca, ulluco) and legumes (broad beans, peas). Mar\u00eda has been doing this for over 6 years and her products are sold in the cold of Colomi. The agricultural inputs that she uses are: organic fertiliser (from chickens), certified seeds that are acquired in the agricultural shops in Colomi, plus preparing the land for sowing time.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Marlene lives in the community of Liriuni, 1 kilometre from Colomi to the north of the village.

She is a very hard-working and contracts casual labour for sowing and harvesting.   \r\n\r\nIt is difficult for them to go to banks in the city in search of a loan. CIDRE is in the Colomi zone and so it is easier for them to get a loan from CIDRE to puchase the agricultural inputs that they need for sowing the next season of crops. In this way they will increase their production of potatoes. Mar\u00eda Marlene tells us that she is going to marry her daughter's father. Her biggest dream is that she has her own house with good comforts, and savings so that her daughter can study. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva

She buys her supplies at the open market in Koutiala and she sells her food dishes in her small restaurant, always in Koutiala, in cash and to a mixed group of customers. \r\nShe hopes to achieve an average profit of 65.000FCFA per month, that she would use to pay interests on her loan and she would invest the rest in income generating activities. Her ambition is to obtain a loan that will allow her to open a big restaurant in the town of Koutiala."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":618083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase food ingredients for a restaurant ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-14T15:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Habiba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":64561.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188752060},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":64561.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360894},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":64561.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580727},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":64561.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232881888}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T12:18:27Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"MONICA URBAN","image":1592573}},{"id":242725,"name":"Bilqees' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bilqees is the resident of Kamoki, which is a small industrial city also known for its rice and other agricultural crops.

Es el d\u00e9cimo pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP y esta muy agradecida con todas las personas que hicieron posible el cr\u00e9dito que le permitir\u00e1 continuar trabajando, adem\u00e1s esta satisfecha con el desempe\u00f1o de sus compa\u00f1eros de su banco comunal pues todos son muy responsables en el pago de sus cuotas. Ana tiene planeado invertir el cr\u00e9dito solicitado en la compra de semilla de arveja y abono para asegurar sus cultivos para la pr\u00f3xima siembra.\n\n","en":"Ana is 43 years old.  She lives in her own home together with her husband, 47 year-old Juan who is a driver (on a fixed route), and her two grown-up children who are still single. \r\n\r\nThis hard-working woman has been farming since she was very young.  When she was a little girl she watched her parents farm and, now she has her own family, she also farms, growing gladioli, peas, carrots and lettuce on her own land, supported by her children.  She says that the effort and commitment that she puts into her farm has its reward when she had a good production and sells her produce to the wholesalers in the city.  This is how Ana earns a living and it allows her to live comfortably with her family.  Ana mentions that she has a lot of projects in mind such as sowing the vegetables that have provided her with so much financial satisfaction in larger quantities as she still has more hectares of land to cultivate and the unconditional support of her children.\r\n\r\nThis is Ana's tenth loan from MFP and she is grateful to everybody who made the loan possible as it will allow her to continue working.  She is also satisfied with the performance of her fellow bank members as they are all very responsible in making their loan repayments.  Ana plans to invest her loan in buying pea seeds and manure in order to safeguard her crops for the next sowing season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":744323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy pea seeds and sacks of manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-05T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacinta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:09Z","rounded_local_amount":560.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621141}],"funded_date":"2011-04-05T15:37:22Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":291898,"name":"Rosa Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Rosa, reside en Jucuapa departamento de Usulut\u00e1n, vive con sus hijos de 18 y 24 a\u00f1os de edad; Ella se dedica a la venta de tortillas, las cuales elabora en su casa desde hace 9 a\u00f1os, su horario de venta es de 10:00am a 6:00pm.\nActualmente ella necesita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar ma\u00edz, le\u00f1a y gas, estos materiales son los insumos necesarios para hacer las tortillas, el pr\u00e9stamo ser\u00e1 una gran ayuda para fortalecer el negocio, aumentar su producci\u00f3n y mejorar su vida cotidiana.\nEl sue\u00f1o y aspiraci\u00f3n de ella es tener un negocio m\u00e1s amplio, con mayor capacidad para atender a los clientes,  recibir mayores ingresos que contribuyan  al mejoramiento de las condiciones de vida de su familia.\n","en":"Rosa lives in Jucuapa, in Usulut\u00e1n department, with her children aged 18 and 24.

He is single, and has one child aged three years old. In 1996, Philip established his balusters, files and blocks business. He began his business because he found it difficult to continue his schooling.  He decided to join his elder brother in the production of bricks and balusters for sale until he became financially strong enough to establish his own shop.  \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about SLL 1,559,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of SLL 4,000,000. Philip has already received and successfully repaid one loan.  He now requires a new loan in order to purchase: cement (50 bags @ SLL 44,000); iron (30 pieces @ SLL 15,000); and sand (20 trips @ SLL 60,000). The balance amount would be for transportation. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately SLL 750,000.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Philip plans to build a house and further his education. He is nervous about the future because he wants a better standard of living. The loan will help a lot as it is his secondary source of income. His major challenge is high taxes levied by the local district council. Competition is not too high, as two businesses are dealing in the same product. He serves contractors and individuals involved in construction and he serves about 10 customers per day. Philip offers a quality product; that is why his business is popular. His suppliers are located in Makeni. He usually buys his goods twice a month by public transport. He saves some and the remainder to add to the capital of the business.

Because her 1 mother pig bore 9 piglets, healthy dan fat. Besides that Jero Ketut Pudak raised 3 other piglets to be fattened. Her husband Gusti Nyoman  Tulis work as a building laborer. Every day Jero Ketut Pudak with persistence raised these 9 one-month old  piglets. Loan from Dinari for Rp 1,700,000 (about US$190-200, depending on exchange rate) are used to buy rice and wheat shell clippings, and konsentrat (local brand). Animal feed price has increase lately, so that the Rp1,700,000 ($200) was not sufficient, since her husband who works as laborer only earns Rp40,000 (about $5)\/day. The additional capital from Dinari would be used to cover the animal food shortage. That is why Jero Ketut Pudak hopes that she could obtain additional loan from Dinari. The stall condition is very simple from wood. The plan is that after harvest she could build a permanent stall. Those are Jero Ketut Pudak wishes. She also has 2 raise 2 children still at school.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDi lingkungan tetangganya di desa Ekasari Jero Ketut Pudak termasuk peternak yang berhasil. Karena 1 induk babinya beranak 9 ekor, anaknya sehat dan gemuk. Disamping itu Jero Ketut Pudak memelihara 3 ekor penggemukan. Suaminya Gusti Nyoman Tulis bekerja sebagai tukang bangunan. Setiap hari Jero Ketut Pudak dengan tekun memelihara 9 anak babinya yang baru berumur 1 bulan. Semua modal pakan yang dipergunakan didapat dari Dinari. Modal yang dipinjam sebesar Rp.1.700.000,- modal ini dipergunakan untuk membeli dedak padi , dedak poral dan konsentrat. Setiap hari semua babinya diberi makan 2 kali setiap pagi dan sore. Harga pakan saat ini semua naik, modal Rp.1.700.000,- masih kurang oleh sebab itu suami Jero Ketut Pudak rajin bekerja sebagai tukang karena upah tukang perhari Rp.40,000,-. Modal tambahan ini bisa untuk menutupi kekurangan pakan ternaknya. Oleh sebab itu Jero Ketut Pudak sangat berharap pinjaman dari Dinari bisa meningkat. Kondisi kandang Jero Ketut Pudak masih sederhana kandang kayu. Rencananya panen nanti kandangnya akan dibuat kandang permanen itu harapan Jero Ketut Pudak disamping itu juga bisa membiayai 2 anaknya yang masih duduk dibangku sekolah."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":73528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy pig feedsock and animal feed<p>Membeli bibit dan pakan babi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-11T16:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jero Ketut Pudak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-25T17:27:19Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-11-25T10:22:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86409},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:36:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100255},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:17:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119060},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T01:27:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138521},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164678},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2008-04-25T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191326}],"funded_date":"2007-10-11T17:27:19Z","paid_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24736,"name":"Nightingale","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nightingale is married with two children.

from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! This is 31-year-old Beata L..  She is married, and has three children, ages 6, 11 and 14. In 2005, Beata established her used clothing business. Beata has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase additional stock of clothing in bulk. She thanks you for your support. <P>Second-hand clothes journey across the ocean from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Dar es Salaam to retailers who re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets of Dar es Salaam and the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost, and the general appeal of anything Western or modern. Some argue that the popularity of the West\u2019s cast-offs is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. There are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress, however the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.<P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of leasing and leaseback microfinance, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing.

Electricity is scarce and there is no access to potable water. Despite the difficulties of living in this area, Azulia successfully runs a small business selling clothing and some other items. With this loan, Azulia will purchase new and used clothing, as well as bed sheets and sandals, to sell to her community.\r\n\r\nThis is Azulia\u2019s third loan with Esperanza International, and with a perfect repayment record so far, she hopes it will not be her last. She came to Esperanza because the interest was lower than what she was able to find elsewhere, with no collateral. With the profits her loan brings, Azulia hopes to finish building her home.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives alone with her 17 year old son since separating from her husband some time ago.  They both live in the Santo Domingo canton.  Santo Domingo is a canton and city in the new Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province, which used to be a rural parish of Quito. Santo Domingo is between the coast and the mountain range in Ecuador, a connecting point between some important cities.  It is situated on the outer edges of the western mountains and in the lower coastal plain at 1000 meters above sea level. This area has the highest rainfall in the country. There is a great abundance of water as there are five important river basins and micro basins here. It is a rainy, subtropical zone, and the average temperature is 22 \u00b0C.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a farmer.  She learned how to do this from her family members when she was very young.  She grows products that are typical of the zone like cacao, yucca, and bananas.  Her small house is very humble.  It does not have electricity, and the floor is not in good condition.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has confided in \u201cFernando\u201d, a young credit adviser with the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, so that he will help her get a loan to fix the floor in her house.

GENSEN has approved this group's request for credit and has received $100 in donations to open their account. <br \/><br \/>Incorporated in 1994 as a Groupement d'Interet Economique or GIE, which is the smallest type of government recognized business, the group currently has 44 members. It first created, farmed and sold the produce from a communal field, using the profits to develop a small cash fund. By collecting dues of $0.20 per month from each member, the group began a rotating credit system, lending from $10 to $50 with 5% interest. They have continued this lending system, dropped the interest rate, and increased the membership dues to a dollar every 4 months. The total in the fund is about $1,200. The group has received and repaid a substantial loan from a federation of women's groups in their regional capital city of Saint Louis. <br \/><br \/>The group also owns large cooking utensils that it rents out to members of the village for parties and ceremonies, the profits of which go back into the fund. Either as a group or through small businesses of its members Femmes de Nder cultivates sweet potatoes, harvests and processes incenses that grows as bulbous roots of an indigenous grass, raises chickens, goats, and sheep; practices local crafts, engages in commerce between Mauritania and Senegal and operates small restaurants. Each year, the group also pays for 4 members to go on a religious pilgrimage to Tivaouane, the holy city of their Muslim religious brotherhood.

A. Obidovna has been selling children's clothing for the past 7 years. She is married and has 3 children. Her husband is a member of a civilian company. He is receiving a very small pension. After the birth of their youngest child Mutabar had to start selling on the market leaving her children under the care of her oldest daughter. In the beginning, she was buying goods wholesale in credit, but the cost was much higher than buying them retail. In 2006 Mutabar first found out about  MicroInvest credit lending. She then took out a loan and was able to buy goods wholesale for lower prices which allowed her to make some profit. She was spending part of her income on the needs of her family and reinvested the rest in her business. To be more competitive, Mutabar intends to travel to Bishkek, the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, which will allow her to start selling wholesale. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

She lives in the village of El Porvenir in the district of Bellavista, department of San Mart\u00edn.  She is married, 34 years old and the mother of four children, three of whom are still dependent on her.  With her first loan of 300 soles and the desire to progress, she opened her business selling prepared food such as traditional \"juanes\" [boiled rice and meat wrapped in leaves] and anticuchos [marinated pieces of beef heart on skewers].  She later decided to change businesses and began raising and selling live chickens which she raises in the garden of her home in order to later offer them for sale in the main market of the city and to the owners of well-known restaurants.  With the loan of 2,000 soles which will be repaid in six months she will buy 100 young chicks to raise, balanced feed and vaccinations so that they will grow to be healthy and fat for later resale, as well as 20 roosters and 20 hens so that they will reproduce.  This business is very profitable.  She is the one who makes the decisions about the revenues and profits from her business; she is an enterprising woman, persevering and always looks to the future with great enthusiasm.

She lives in the house that one of her family members has ceded to her, and what she wants most is to improve the quality of her life.\n\nHer work is artisanal knitting, which she does both by hand and by machine. She has carried out this activity since she was 12 years old, when she helped her parents complete their orders. For the past 4 years, she has had her own handicraft workshop where she makes sweaters, scarves, hats, gloves, etc., garments that she sells on the weekends at her location on the seasonal Laguna esplanade (the place where they have markets in the city of Juliaca), where she waits on her clients with great pleasure. \n\nWhat she likes most about her work is talking with her customers and advising them on the garments that suit them best. The most difficult part of her work is remaining all day at her sales location, since she has to take care of it. Even so, she knows that she has to work very hard to reach her goals. With time, she hopes to increase her business and have a bigger store of handmade clothing.\n\nThis is Virginia's first loan with MFP, and she hopes to be punctual in her payments, since she doesn't want to damage the reputation of the other members of her community bank, where she is well-liked and respected.

Married to Sonny A., a driver\/mechanic, they are blessed with three children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been selling frozen foods while also maintaining a cosmetics and underclothing direct selling line.\r\n\r\nMa. Dely has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 24,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business. She will buy more quantities of the usual products in her current product inventory to replenish stocks and to maintain operations of her businesses.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education. She envisions herself to be God\u2019s worker, and she hopes that, through her businesses, she can help as many people as she can.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

In 2007, he started his own business as a farmer with eight years of previous experience. He learned this occupation from his father who also works as a farmer. He owns a large piece of land where he cultivates multiple types of fruits and vegetables according to the season. He delivers the harvest to a big vegetable market in his town and to some small markets. He is thankful for his business income and he plans to make more profit by adding more cultivation. He is requesting $1,200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase a farming machine to renovate his soil and add more seeds to expand his production.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\n\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and the mother of four children. Mavlyuda's lack of a stable job and the low productivity of her husband's business didn't leave enough money to pay the expenses of the home and of her little daughter. This was the reason why Mavlyuda decided to start her own business 10 years ago, selling fabrics for traditional dresses. Little by little she has made her business grow, and by offering her clients the chance to pay in installments, her orders are getting bigger. <P>\r\n\r\nNow her business is running normally. However, she would like to continue bettering herself and her business. She is asking for a loan of 2500 Somoni that she will pay back in 10 months. With this money, Mavlyuda will be able to buy seasonal fabrics for national dresses. The power to help her business grow is in your hands.<P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Radjabali is 46 years old. He lives with his wife and their three children. He has been breeding cattle for more than 13 years and he is trying to improve the breed in order to increase his prices. He invests time and money in the feed and medicines that the animals require. He enjoys this work, especially getting milk from his cows, which his wife sells in local markets. Radjabali keeps going thanks to the help and enthusiasm of his children, who, along with his wife, help him care for the animals. \r\n\r\nRadjabali needs a loan of $800 USD to buy more calves to expand his business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

This is how plant selling became their principle source of income and where they put all their efforts.  Her husband travels to other cities selling and distributing the plants, while she buys and contracts with the suppliers.  The best part of her work is that it only keeps her occupied for 3 days a week: Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, which leaves her spare time to dedicate to her baby daughter.  One day they will plan another type of business for her days off, but they still haven\u2019t decided what to do and also they do not want to neglect their daughter.  They believe that spending time with her is just as important as time spent working. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and Mar\u00eda promises to be very responsible with the repayments.

livelihood for eight years in Kayunga. A father of four, he decided to engage in this business because coffee is Uganda's premier cash crop which sells well, especially if one is selling it to the many coffee cooperative unions all over the country. Coffee was Uganda's number one foreign exchange export earner in the early 80's. Though times have changed for the worse because of the fluctuations in coffee prices on the international markets, many Ugandans are not about to dispense with this business any time soon. Many people in their late 50s speak with nostalgia about the good old days coming back, when they were able to give their children a good education with earnings from their coffee sales. \r\n\r\nThere has been recent improvement with better coffee prices from the re-emerging coffee unions to coffee farmers who have good-grade coffee. As a result, many coffee farmers, Godfrey included, can now bask in the glow of improved sales profits. Godfrey took over this business from his late father. Weekly, he makes sales profits totaling Ugandan shillings 60,000. He says he is going to use this Kiva loan to purchase young coffee plants to grow. He envisages being able to make more profits when the plants mature and produce better high-grade, robust Arabica coffee to sell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":813015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase young coffee plants to grow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kayunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 32.866667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-16T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hassan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siraje","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lawrence","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gorret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":666666.67,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:23:40Z","rounded_local_amount":672958.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227248980},{"amount":487.82,"local_amount":1258883.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-01T09:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1270764.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868550},{"amount":287.18,"local_amount":741116,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:22:10Z","rounded_local_amount":748110.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648384},{"amount":222.81,"local_amount":575002,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":580428.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313745},{"amount":263.98,"local_amount":681232,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-02T09:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":687661.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275372},{"amount":29.88,"local_amount":77100,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-28T08:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":77827.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264223719}],"funded_date":"2011-07-17T05:53:14Z","paid_date":"2012-04-28T08:05:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hannon","image":null}},{"id":320632,"name":"Esterlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esterlita is a 31-year-old woman, married and humbly residing in Clarin, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

She is 39 years of age, very hardworking and a go-getter. She hails from Mwichune, a remote village in the Nkubu area of Kenya. Doris has defied all the odds and has been engaged in farming for the past ten years. \n\nHer primary sources of income are crops,banana and animal farming. Doris is content with the farming way of life. Doris is a very enterprising woman, and although she never had formal education or formal employment, she has always worked hard on her farm and she has always assured her children and family of a decent meal. The Mwichune area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to buy seeds and start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business. Being a smallholder farmer and accessing funds in Nkubu is very challenging, but Doris feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising smallholder women like her. \n\nDoris is well disciplined with finances and she plans that through the accumulated profits, she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children who are in school. Please help Doris so that her horticulture farm can flourish!\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2050387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming and provide a better income for her children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2933.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3018.78},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3107},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3197.8},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3291.26},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3387.45},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3486.44},{"due_date":"2016-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3588.34},{"due_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3693.2},{"due_date":"2016-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3801.14},{"due_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3912.23},{"due_date":"2016-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4026.56},{"due_date":"2017-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4144.24},{"due_date":"2017-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4265.35},{"due_date":"2017-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4390.01},{"due_date":"2017-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4518.31},{"due_date":"2017-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4650.35},{"due_date":"2017-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4786.26},{"due_date":"2017-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4926.14},{"due_date":"2017-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5070.1},{"due_date":"2017-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5218.28},{"due_date":"2017-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5370.78},{"due_date":"2017-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5527.73},{"due_date":"2017-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5689.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.19},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.07},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.98},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.91},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.88},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.87},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.88},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.93},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.01},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.12},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.27},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.44},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.66},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.9},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.18},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.5},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.86},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.26},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.7},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.18},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.28},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":198,"name":"Willian Isai Lopez","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"I have had my barbershop for three years.

She has been a farmer since she was a little girl because her parents were poorl and they depended on their crops.  When she got married, her husband farmed leased farmlands.  To date they have been unable to purchase their own land.  However, they lease four manzanas (a traditional unit of land area in Central America) on which they grow tomatoes, peppers and radishes.  \r\n\r\nSometimes, due to drought or lack of fertilizers, they lose part of the crops in which they have invested all their seed; this makes it very difficult.  For this reason, the need arises to seek financing to buy the necessary manure, fertilizers and seed because they are about to plant tomato and peppers.  They hope to produce good product that will sell at the best market prices so that they can meet household expenses and repay the loan on time.

Victor is a dedicated father and producer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvesting of Cayenne peppers in an effort to improve living conditions. He works in cooperation with his family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities.  In addition to his agricultural activity, Victor feels it is important to be an active member of his community. As a result, he dedicates a significant portion of his time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Victor and his family live is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Victor is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labor. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Victor and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All laborial and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Victor, with the help of his family members in the region of Upala. The production cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Victor planted his peppers 4 months ago and will expect to harvest in the next 8 months. Typically, he dedicates the hours from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM everyday to his agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial (PROPICA) is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Victor and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA, represents a unique opportunity to Victor, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Victor wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. He wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his home and neighborhood. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":618243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase of agricultural ingredients and chemicals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Upala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T20:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65568.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66661.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67770.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":178.28,"local_amount":89141.9,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":90692.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289985},{"amount":68.06,"local_amount":34031.6,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-29T07:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":34623.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227043876},{"amount":153.66,"local_amount":76826.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":78163.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232804911}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T08:55:11Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":242789,"name":"Lourdes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lourdes S. is from the village of Poblacion 2, Clarin, Misamis Occ.

","en":"Sra. Ivet Azucena P. Orizaba lives in a town called San Jose Purua in the Mexican state of Michoacan.  It's a beautiful place known for its hot springs and sulfur baths.  Dona Ivet, 24, married very young, in her third year of high school, and has worked at caring for her house and family since then.  Her husband didn't let her study because he wanted her to take care of their son.  Dona Ivet, as she likes to be called, is applying for a loan to invest in her cellular phone shop.  She wants to buy cell phones, accessories and telephone minutes to resell.  She has operated the business for approximately 3 year in a space that she borrowed from relatives.  She says that she buys her merchandise from an authorized dealer in Zitacuaro because she pays less there and can earn more when she resells the merchandise.  She likes the business very much because it allows her to keep an eye on her children.  Sra. Ivet is married to Sr. Enrique who sells seasonal flowers.

One must strive hard to provide sustenance for the crops to achieve an abundant harvest. \r\n\r\nHe is 33 years old and had been cultivating his farm for almost 10 years. Marlon earned about PHP 30,000 at the last cropping season in May from his own farm land. Net income earned every harvest is used to sustain the education of his three children.\r\n\r\nMarlon is now asking for a loan of PHP 10,000 due to insufficient funds to buy the seeds, fertilizers and insecticides used in farming. With the help of this loan, he can improve his rice production. \r\n\r\nMarlon hopes to continue growing as an entrepreneur.
