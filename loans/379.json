She is a mother of 7 children and three grandchildren with 6 great grand children aged between 10 and 6 years. She lives with her 90-year-old husband and her great grand children. Makhothatso finds life very difficult seeing that both she and her husband are unemployed and find means of living from pension and crop farming. They live in a traditional hut that is not well ventilated, nor does it warm up well in winter. \n\nTogether with her husband, she works long hours to ensure there is enough food for her family, some of whom are going to school and only help her in the field on Saturdays and Sundays. She has to wake up very early, between 4am and 5am, during the week to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water, and warming the house for all the children before they go to school. Collecting firewood, setting up the fire, and doing the actual cooking demands a lot of her time. \n\nTemperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high. Winters can get very cold, and often Makhothatso has to start the fire inside her hut. Starting a fire releases smog and smoke, which when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time can lead to lung diseases, eye problems, and in the worst case, death. In these circumstances, life for people like Makhothatso is very difficult. \n\nMakhothatso has requested a loan from Kiva lenders in order to be able to purchase clean cook stoves, which will provide her and 6 other people from her village, who are living in similar circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families, and that does not require expensive paraffin and gas, or a lot of wood, which is hard to find in Lesotho. This stove can be started with the use of very little readily-available biomass, like dry twigs and dry cow dung, that does not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the home. \n\nThis stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery, which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones, and a mini LED lamp. It is a life-improving package for these women. This stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates toxic inhalation, and gives them a better lit home to see in the evening while cooking and enables children to do their homework.

This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

Quitting school due to a lack of money, he turned towards an apprenticeship in maintaining and repairing electronic equipment.  Since finishing his training, he has not been practicing his trade very effectively because he lacked the money to open a shop.  He worked with his friends who were able to open a shop, but he didn't appropriately benefit from it.  Despite all his talent with electronics, Mr. A. continues to lead a difficult life.  <p>To solve the situation, he is requesting a loan to open his shop.  The loan will enable him to rent a place and to acquire work supplies.  Realizing this project will launch this energetic and dedicated young man's business.

Supplies are gotten from rural producers (for the rice) and from wholesale merchants locally and from fair vendors from Sikasso (for the condiments).  Sales are made at the retail level, cash or credit accepted, at the house and the San marketplace.  The customers are composed of retailers and women. \r\n<p>\r\nThey each hope to realize an average profit of 300,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The profits will be used to pay the loan interest, to provide for the extended family, and to invest the rest in business.

She is 54 years old. Lucena is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Lucena owns & operates a foodstall in the market. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products like salt, vegetables, coffee, sugar,  etc. in the local community. Lucena is just starting this business.\n\nIn 2005, Lucena joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lucena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 Philippine Pesos (about US $319) from GDMPC. Lucena is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Lucena from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Ignacia M. S. (in the red blouse) is 44 years old and returned to school where she finished her training as a technical nurse.  She also has a vending stall where she sells products grown by her family.  Do\u00f1a Ignacia is in a common law marriage with Sr. Juan Miguel Mart\u00ednez, who also sells fruits and vegetables.  They have 3 children, two in elementary school and the other in high school.  She lives at Avenue 4 Lot 35 in the Moctezuma settlement of the city of Orizaba VeraC..  Do\u00f1a Ignacia tells us that her community is peaceful and well managed, and that most of the residents have their own businesses.  It is one of the oldest settlements in the city of Orizaba and has a rich tradition as well as a great atmosphere that prevails throughout the community.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Ignacia learned about Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad through friends and was encouraged to organize a group, which was named \u201cEstrella\u201d (Star).  She saw this was a great opportunity to grow her business because she wanted to add groceries to the products she offers.  She will use her loan to buy fruit (apples, bananas, pears, and oranges), vegetables (tomatoes, peppers, onions, potatoes, carrots, and lettuce), and groceries (oil, rice, paper, soap, and mayonnaise).  \r\n<p>\r\nThe \u201cEstrella\u201d Group is composed of 10 women who have been friends for a long time and meet on the weekends.  They are requesting a loan so that they can improve the quality of life for themselves and their families.  Most of them sell products by catalog, but others sell clothing, snacks, and natural yogurt.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Ignacia is very pleased with her loan because she will be able to offer a variety of fruits, vegetables and groceries and give her customers more choices.  She will be able to get better returns which will enable her to repay her loan and improve the quality of life for her children.\r\n<p>\r\nThe dream of Do\u00f1a Ignacia is to provide for her children so that they can finish their studies.  She hopes to have her own vending location so that she can increase her earnings and expand her business by selling chickens.  She is grateful to Kiva for helping ordinary people who are complete strangers.  The assistance provided to these women help them have their own businesses and improve the quality of life for their families.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

This can only be done with special machines.  Even though she needs to pay for the sewing, making these items is very profitable.  They contract her to make large amounts of clothing.  That is why Hilda dreams of one day setting up her own business.

The group's members decided to take this name because it is the name of the community where they live and they all originally come from there.  This story is about Mrs Odilia M. R. who is one of the group's members.  She is 48 years old and married.  Her husband is called Emigdio Tacuba.  They have two children; Isela who is 22 and Abel who is 19.  Both of their children are studying.  One is in their second year of a law degree and the other is in the third year of senior high school.  Odilia has a grocery store which she has been running for 10 years.\r\n\r\nOdilia decided on this business because she says there is a lot of demand and it makes good profits.  She also wanted to help her husband a bit with household expenses and the education of their children. She will use her loan to purchase more merchandise for her shop such as rice, beans, milk, sugar, soft drinks, eggs, oil, toilet paper and other products so that it is well stocked.\r\n\r\nOdilia says that her business also benefits her neighbors a lot as there are not many people who have stores near where they live so, as she is the only one who sells there and is close by, they all buy from her.  She offers her customers excellent service and attentiveness as well as reasonable prices.\r\n\r\nOdilia's dream is to extend her house so that she can make her store a little bigger and thereby have a much better stocked store so that she can obtain more and better profits.  This will enable her to continue supporting her children with their higher education so that they can get into very good professions.\r\n\r\nOdilia tells us that the members of her group are very responsible and reliable payers since they have known each other for a long time and they get on very well together.  This is why they have never been late in their payments or missed any payments.  They do not want to let down the company that has shown trust in them.\r\n\r\nOdilia is very thankful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva for the support of the loan which they are offering.  Thanks to the loan she is able to improve her life and that of her family.\r\n\r\nThe members of 'El Limoncito' and the businesses which they work in are as follows:\r\n\r\nClara B.

He\u2019s been growing cacao for most of his adult life - 30 years. \u201cI like farmers. We have to work otherwise we don\u2019t have anything. It\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s a farmer\u2019s life,\u201d says Felipe. \n\nBeside cacao, Felipe also receives income from corn sold at the Punta Gorda market, one hour down the road from San Jose, as well as beans and yams sold locally. He has used this money to invest in one of few solar panels in the village of San Jose, Toledo District, which is not connected to the grid due to poor road access. The solar panel is hooked to a battery and an inverter to provide electricity for stable phone use and light. What helped Felipe beat his peers in installing electricity in the home? \u201cI never neglect anything,\u201d he says, and lives by it. \n\nFelipe will use the loan to invest in cleaning his cacao plots.

Moureen also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have an overall improved quality of life.\n\nObtaining this loan means that Moureen's Group will be able to receive a total of 12 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 5 acres.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2046591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moureen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Renson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxmilah N","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aspro K","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janepher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jescah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Priscilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selina A","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":86575,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86575}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":626,"name":"Maria Eulalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>\u00a0Everyone knows me as dona Maria, I have had my business, located in the community of Chichicaste, for two years.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

","en":"Mahbubahon's business is selling perfume and cosmetics at the \"Panshanbe\" market.  She rents a store on the second floor of the market, where she sells different brands of products, including Nivea, Dove, Oriflame, Avon and Faberlic.  To order products from these companies, she needs to pay in advance.  For this reason, Mahbubahon is applying for a loan to pay for her most recent order from Oriflame.  Mahbubahon has been an MLF client for two years.  As her business develops and expands in the future, she plans to open her own name-brand store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":306739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-25T01:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahbubahon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":212.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599970},{"amount":55,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-21T07:47:32Z","rounded_local_amount":212.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994395},{"amount":55,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:05:35Z","rounded_local_amount":212.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215660},{"amount":55,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:28:49Z","rounded_local_amount":212.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645153},{"amount":55,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":212.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084713}],"funded_date":"2009-04-25T12:25:08Z","paid_date":"2009-11-14T09:20:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susie Armitage","image":null}},{"id":107147,"name":"02-\u0110\u00f4ng H\u1ea3i Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Minh N. Th\u1ecb is a 44 year old female living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1. Minh is the group leader of a 7 member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 02 \u0110\u00f4ng H\u1ea3i (16.02.02).\r\n\r\nMinh is married and has 2 school-aged children. To making a living, Minh owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising cattle for sale. Minh has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 900.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Minh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Minh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3.079.800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. She is now requesting a new loan of 6.000.000 VND which will also be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. The loan will be the 7th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Minh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  L\u00ea Th\u1ecb Oa is a 46 year old female who is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\r\n\r\n2.  N.

Th\u1ecb Xu\u00e2n is a 43 year-old female who is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\r\n\r\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\r\n\r\nNote: Many FPW borrowers have expressed a desire to borrow larger amounts to make more significant investments in their businesses. In response to this, FPW has recently added a new loan product of 6.000.000 VND with a 20 month term to its Thanh Hoa City branch portfolio. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nMinh N.

She is 42 years old. Eden is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Eden owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling rice in the village. She sells it per sack or even by kilos; sometimes she offers credit payable at the end of the month. Eden has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Eden joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eden has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional rice to sell. Eden is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP (US$300), which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fourth loan Eden has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by Oxfam at Thi\u00e8s, in which she became familiar with group organization and running a business. The members of the group are dedicated to what they do, and meet together once a month. Over and above membership dues, each of them pays 200 FCFA a month into a group operating fund.\r\n\r\nLooking for financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. The network is divided into 19 subgroups of five people so that financing can be better handled. Each subgroup has its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey now seek, for the second time, a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member or 500,000 FCFA for each subgroup, to grow their various activities. The members repay their loans to the president and the treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck. They, in turn, are responsible for repaying U-IMCEC. According to the president, the group\u2019s praiseworthy objective is to fight family poverty.\r\n\r\nThe 5th sub-group (Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b0 5) consists of:\r\n\u2022\tMs. Yacine S., the president of this sub-group, born in 1962. For the past 17 years she has sold dried fish, palm oil and clothing fabrics in the market. She is married and mother of one child aged 26. As she says, she is active because she needs to combat idleness and handle both her needs and those of her family.

N. will purchase paint, firewood, and soft drinks to improve her business.\r\n\r\nAlejandra F. A. is a member of the group. She is 27 years old and she has a grade 9 education. She lives with her boyfriend, a farmhand, and they have 2 children together: Candido is 8 years old and is in primary school, and Sergio is 2. She has a stand from where she sells corn on the cob, prepared corn, corn drinks, and baked corn cakes. \r\n\r\nWith her loan she wishes to purchase a tricycle to sells her products, a stove and a tank of gas, as well as mayonnaise, and popsicle sticks.  She sells corn on the cob, prepared corn, corn drinks, and corn cakes. \r\n\r\nAlejandra started her business 8 years ago following her aunts retirement from her business. She gave her the cooking tubs and sticks that she had and her mother loaned her some money to purchase corn and she also loaned her a stove.  Alejandra knew how to make corn drinks, prepared corn and corn cakes, as her mother taught her. She sells every day of the week from a wheelbarrow from 5pm to 7:30pm every evening through the streets of Tlayacapan.  She travels through all the streets of her town to sell her products. \r\n\r\nHer business is important because it helps her financially, especially when her husband is out of work and she is still able to buy food. She enjoys preparing the corn for sale and she is very proud because she is well known, especially for her corn cakes and corn drinks. They are very tasty and she always sells out. She tends to more than 50 customers every day. Her business is popular because everyone knows her cooking and they place orders. \r\n\r\nShe faces a challenge when the hot weather approaches and the sales drop. She also finds the competition a challenge. When she first started out she was the only one in the business and today there are many people who sell corn, prepared corn, and corn drinks. \r\n\r\nThe profits from the business will be used to reinvest in business, to pay off some debts, and to repay this loan. Her plan is to find a store from where she can be settled in to sell her product to avoid running the streets. \r\n\r\nTlayacapan is a tourist area that is visited by many travelers who wish to see the old convent and the mummies. They sell terra cotta pottery, and very ornate pots. There is also a very popular musical group named Santa Maria. \r\n\r\nHer business has helped her family when someone falls ill and she was also able to build a house with the help of her husband, who also contributed to the expenses and improvements. Her plans and dream for her children are to provide them with an education. Alejandra is very happy to receive this loan to establish her business as she dreams.  She will be able to give her children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group wish to convey to Kiva and Fundacion Realidad (Kiva Field Partner) \"Thank you very much and we hope to keep accessing loans while we keep your trust. They are a great help to us in advancing our businesses\".\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":686801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a tricycle, a stove, a tank of gas, and ingredients.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rafael's first loan will go towards cleaning, which for cacao farmers means removing the underbrush in order to plant new seedlings, prepare for pruning or harvesting by opening pathways and access to the trees. \n\nRafael recently expanded the scope of his cacao farm by transplanting \u2013 moving seedlings from bags into the ground \u2013 300 trees. Planting new seedlings is a long-term investment, as cacao trees take 3-5 years to start producing pods. \n\nInvestment in the farm facilitated by loans translates to investment in his children, 5 of whom are currently enrolled in school.

Before he received a loan from SMT, Yenku survived by begging in the street of Kabala town and, as one might imagine, life was extremely hard for him and his family.  Through lengthy discussions with SMT staff, SMT recognized that Yenku has strong business skills.

Today, Yenku is off the street and is managing his business in the village.  He sells cotton clothes, cosmetics, etc.  Assisted by his wife, the family has built a small mud house and has a small farm.

With her current loan (her eighth) she plans to buy two types of firewood to split and pack in her compound and to sell.\r\nShe will start repayment three months from the day of disbursement. The success of the business is guaranteed because she is experienced in the business and she has a ready market for dry firewood. Mary plans to use the profit from the business to pay school fees for her children, give good medical attention to her family and also provide balance diet to her family members.\r\nMary is a member in GHAPE, and  she has been taught how to manage the loan from GHAPE. The method of repayment is comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":316455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buying, transporting, splitting and selling of fire wood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Foncha St, Nkwen, NW.

With additional income Hasan will be better able to meet his family's financial obligations, especially the education of his children.   \r\n\r\n<P>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Garc\u00eda, 53, lives in the Claret neighborhood in Bogot\u00e1.  It is the most heavily populated area of Colombia, and it is its most important cultural and economic center.  It is also called \u201cThe Athens of South America\u201d.  People from all over the country live here, and they have contributed the ancient cultural traditions of Bogot\u00e1.  They are introducing new generations to ways of being and doing things.  This is the case with Mar\u00eda Margarita.  She is from C\u00facuta of the Norte de Santandar department, and she came to Bogot\u00e1 seven years ago to be close to her children.  Her children came looking for the opportunity to educate themselves and become police officials in the capital of Colombia.  Mar\u00eda Margarita had a commercial activity in her native city, and she moved it to the Claret neighborhood in Bogot\u00e1.  It is located near the Military School.  This is a commercial area where you can find banks, clothing shops, and book stores.  The name comes from the Claretiana Community, which was blessed by priests who lived there.  This was how the infrastructure was when she decided to sell her products by catalog in this neighborhood.  They say that it is not easy to live in another city far from your family where people do not know you.  Also, you need a lot of money to devote to the education of your children, the costs of military careers, and to change cities.  This appears to be her biggest challenge.\r\n\r\nShe is currently married, and she has two children; 27 and 25.  They are now police officers.  Her business consists of catalog sales of jewelry, jeans, and purses.  This is her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She has participated with the organization in learning processes to increase her skills in managing the market and entrepreneurial loans.  Mar\u00eda Margarita is applying for a loan for 1,500,000 COP to buy two jewelry display packages that have approximately two and a half dozen earrings, six rings, and six chains.

He is 42 years old. Adelito is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Adelito raises livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Adelito has been engaged in his business for more than eight years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Adelito joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. Adelito has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Adelito is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Adelito from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay his children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers, and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She recalls that she used her first loan to buy clothes; she\u2019s always been in this line of work.  But she used to work with very little capital and now, thanks to the loans she\u2019s gotten, she\u2019s been able to grow and increase her capital.  She will use this requested loan to buy clothes at the Huano Huano market.  She loves the meetings of her communal bank because she districts herself and receives much training, like on how to improve her business.

She has been in the business for more than 10 years and it is doing very well.\r\n\r\nDoralisa is requesting a new loan as her previous loan made her good profits. She was able to use her profits to improve her financial and family situation.  She will use this new loan to buy more merchandise such as pants, blouses, t-shirts and children's clothes.  She will take advantage of the time of year as it is when she sells the most.  She has been a member of her community bank for four years and she likes it because the interest rates are lower than they are with other banks.\r\n\r\nDoralisa's dreams are for her children to never want for anything, and to get ahead in life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":759134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy pants, blouses, t-shirts and children's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-01-08T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doralisa Asunci\u00f3n ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257183305},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263318958},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033802},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645881}],"funded_date":"2012-01-08T20:58:27Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":382581,"name":"Joel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joel is 29 years old and single.

She's a farmer but she also raises livestock, something that she's done for 10 years.  It's work to which she's dedicated because thanks to the business, she's had the money to better feed and clothe her loved ones.  She also likes getting up very early and staying busy during the day because work for her is one of life's pleasures and makes her feel that she's doing something useful for her family.  Without a doubt, though, the thing that Nancy likes best is being with her family who provide the support necessary for her to keep striving.  What gratifies her most is seeing her animals get fatter so that she can ultimately sell them.  Nancy is just starting at MFP.  She's a hard-working woman, a sure guarantee that her loan will be repaid.

M. Ashrafjon has dedicated himself to cattle-raising for eight years now to support his humble family which so relies on him. <p>\r\n\r\nCurrently, Ashrafjon is requesting of IMON International a loan of $700 to purchase calves that he can raise. It\u2019s important to note that the granting of this loan will not only benefit him, but also his children and wife, the family he  greatly loves.   <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Isfandiyor, 24, is married and has a small child. He is the sole breadwinner for his family, which also includes his parents. His only income comes from cultivation and sale of large livestock at the local market. Every year, he buys young heifers from the farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with help from his wife and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. Isfandiyor is thinking of expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase one additional young cattle and this may need an additional investment of USD 600 in his business. Hence, Isfandiyor has applied for a loan from IMON International, a partner of Kiva.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Karina y su familia son personas de mucha persistencia, pues antes de emprender su tienda,  hab\u00edan sido desplazados de su tierra en el departamento de Bol\u00edvar, posteriormente cuando estaban trabajando con firmeza, sobrevino la ola invernal , pero ellos no se dejan vencer por las adversidades y por eso en Ciudad bicentenario emprendieron su propia panader\u00eda, que aprovechando su anterior experiencia,  quieren darle un esquema de tienda donde adicionalmente vendan ranchos, v\u00edveres y art\u00edculos de la canasta familiar.

She has a bakery there where she produces bread and pastries that she sells among the residents of Ciudad Bicentenario Macroproject which is supported by Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and is where she lives.\r\n\r\nShe had started the bakery business with her spouse in a different neighborhood but the winter surf eroded her house and they lost their resources which is how the family came to be relocated to this mega project.  Karina and her family are very persistent people because before starting her store they had been displaced from their land in Bol\u00edvar Department and then when they had succeeded in working steadily the winter surf came.   But they don\u2019t let themselves be defeated by adversity and that\u2019s why they started their own bakery in Ciudad Bicentenario which availing themselves of their prior experience they want to transform  into a store where they will also sell snacks, foodstuffs and basic staple items.\r\n\r\nIn her business, Karina\u2019s husband prepares the bread and desserts and she very creatively goes out with her display case that she attached wheels to selling throughout the mega neighborhood where she now lives.\r\n\r\nThey have many dreams of prosperity like setting up a stand-alone locale to better develop their micro business.  This is why they are calling on their Kiva loan, their first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that will be used to buy merchandise sold in stores like foodstuffs, meat, groceries as well as ingredients for bakery items in large volume because she still has her oven, cylindrical display cases and still makes bread and desserts that she sells from her rolling display case.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1072265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise sold in stores like foodstuffs, meat, groceries as well as ingredients for bakery items in large volume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":68513},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82089},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84004},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85964},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":87970},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90023},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":92123},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94273},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":96473},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":98724},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":101027},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118817}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.64},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.82},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":431958,"name":"Benkadi  6 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les membres du groupe  Benkadi  6 sont des femmes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 36 ans, 5 enfants et vivant toutes dans des  familles traditionnelles \u00e0  Djigonso, un des villages de San, 4\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s agricoles pendant l\u2019hivernage. \nElles sont \u00e0 leur troisi\u00e8me pr\u00eat avec l\u2019institution, les pr\u00eats pass\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bien rembours\u00e9s.\nLes sp\u00e9culations cultiv\u00e9es sont : le riz et soja avec    SETOU,  1 ere debout en \u00e9charpe jaune  sur la photo.\nAvec son pr\u00eat, elle compte acheter des intrants, des semences, des petits mat\u00e9riels agricoles et payer les frais de labour pour entretenir : 1 hectare. \nLa production sera vendue au niveau du village et au march\u00e9 de San, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9colte, \u00e0 une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e d\u2019hommes et de femmes. \nElle compte r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice moyen de 170.000FCFA par campagne.\nCe b\u00e9n\u00e9fice lui permettra de payer son pr\u00eat et aussi d\u2019aider son mari dans les d\u00e9penses quotidiennes.\n\n","en":"The members of the group \"Benkadi 6\" are married women averaging 36 years of age and five children each all living in traditional families in Djigonso, a village in San (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali) The women are collaborating with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso to carry out their farm work during the rainy season.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

My parents were not able to give me good education because of their little financial resources. I am married to a man whose name is M. I. and he has been a vegetable seller for the past 10 years. I am a mother of six kids: two sons and four daughters. My elder son works in a factory. Another reads in 4th standard. My elder daughter is married and she and her husband also live with us. My son-in-law has a spare parts selling business. My other daughters are getting education from a school which located near to the house. <p>\r\n\r\nI believe in hard work and I transfer this value to my kids also. I get up early and do household work, and then I help my husband in setting the vegetables on his cart. I have successfully repaid my first loan which I took from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). Now I am applying again for a loan to buy spare parts to expand my son-in-law\u2019s spare parts selling business. <p>\r\n \r\nI\u2019m a group leader of some more women of my locality. Farzana firdous baji and Majidan baji each want a loan to buy groceries for her grocery shop. Razia baji wants a loan to buy iron to resell. <p>\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are

Primary School for Infants in Hastings requesting a group loan. The school was founded by the government to give pre-school education to the children of the Hastings community. There are currently 596 pupils and 13 staff.  Like many schools in Sierra Leone, R.E.C. Primary School for Infants lacks adequate classrooms, seating, and learning and teaching materials.\r\n\r\nThis will be the first loan for the teachers from SMT\/Kiva. Because government salaries for teachers are usually very small, the SMT\/Kiva loans are very much helpful to these teachers. With these loans, some of the teachers will invest in a side business to supplement their teaching salaries.  Others will use it to buy pieces of furniture like a bed or chairs, buy a piece of land on which to build a house, or purchase building materials.  Others will use the loan to pay for college fees to pursue further studies, or school fees for their children.  Gradually, with their monthly salaries, these teachers will repay their loans.\r\n\r\nGifty M. N. (fifth from right) is the deputy head teacher of the R.E.C. Primary School for Infants. She was born in Hastings, about twenty-three miles from Freetown, which is the capital city of Sierra Leone.  She is single with four children.  One of her children is already an adult, two are in secondary school, and one is still in primary school.  She has been a teacher for 31 years now.

She now hopes for a new loan to expand both businesses.\r\n\r\nRahma will share this loan with her loan group, Mara, which totals 15 members. These members hold each other accountable in paying back their loans. In the picture, Rahma is first on the right, back row, in a red

She is 58 years old and is the group leader of this eight-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Isabelita M.'s Group.\r\n\r\nIsabelita is married and has nine school-aged children. She owns and operates a transportation business, providing motorcycle transport to local community members. She has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Isabelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to repair a transport vehicle used in her business.\r\n\r\nIsabelita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will again be used to repair a transport vehicle used in her business. This loan will be her third from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-one branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

She also sells beauty products to salon, beauty shops and barber shops. \r\n<p>\r\nThe way in which a direct sales business works is that a customer\u2019s order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, so these are the profits that dealers count on as their income. \r\n<p>\r\nMelita\u2019s regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every week. To help her continue operations, she is requesting a 34,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.

This activity is very common in their place and many entrepreneurs do this.\r\n\r\nJocelyn wishes to expand her business by buying more piglets, vitamins, and feed for piglets, in order to forge ahead with her business and be able to help her family to get ahead. For this reason, she is, for the second time approaching KIVA lenders through ASHI, for a loan amounting to 20,000 Php to help her reach her goal.\r\n\r\nJocelyn is a hard-working woman dedicated to her home. Her dream is to care for her seven children and offer them a better quality of life, out of poverty. Jocelyn\u2019s neighbors, friends and even her group mates consider her respectful person.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to provide a better future for her family, sustain the profitability of her hog-raising business, start a savings account for her children and support them to finish their studies until they complete college to get better careers someday.\r\n\r\nWith hard work and determination, Jocelyn is focused on improving her quality of life through her business efforts and support from ASHI and Kiva lenders across the world.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":659515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Llamkasun Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cHuklla Llamkasun\u201d is a small rural community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari-project which provides its credit with educational services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations, being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 6,000 \u2013 17,000 ft above sea level). People who live there also face the cold,  difficulty growing crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<P>\r\nBCR \u201cHuklla Llamkasun\u201d is located in the community of A\u00f1ancusi in the district of Acoria, province of Huancavelica. The translation of the Quechua-name of the group is \u201cLet\u00b4s work as if we were one\u201d. The main activities of the population are growing tropical fruits at lower altitudes and corn, potatoes and wheat at higher altitudes. At still higher altitudes, the people are dedicated to raising bulls and cows, with alpacas and lamas at the highest altitudes. But the size of the community and its (limited) access to public transport has brought more commerce to the village; every Tuesday there is a local market where people sell and buy most of what they need.<P>\r\n\r\nThis bank has been formed recently by 17 female borrowers and therefore has no history yet\u2026. It has only just started to create history in its community! The expectations working with FINCA Peru are very clear: increase business and save. For all members, the main use of the savings they will be generating from now on is for investing in their business or for the education of their children, whether it is buying school uniforms, supplies, books or even to pay the fees for entering primary or secondary school.  <P>\r\n\r\nAlthough many women dedicate their time to similar businesses, they require different loan amounts because of the differences in the size of the business they run \u2026. The loans range from 200 soles, 300 soles, up to 500 soles; the total of the loans of the 17 members is 5,400 soles (US$ 1925).<P>\r\n\r\nOne of the group members, Lucila R. Nolberta, sells fruit at local markets. Another business she runs is raising small cattle. As is the case in most families, besides her business, she dedicates most of her time to the cultivation of potatoes, wheat, and oca (a root vegetable), which she uses for home consumption. With her 200 soles loan she will be able to buy more fruits. When asked about her future, she tells us that her dream is the education of her children so they can be professionals and go on studying. She simply wants to make her life and that of her family better. With her (future) savings she plans to buy more chickens and pigs, to sell when they have grown big.<P>\r\n\r\nJuliana D. Mar\u00edn, who sells clothes and shoes in her small shop, tells us a slightly different story.  Like Lucila, Juliana grows potatoes, wheat, and other crops for home consumption. With her loan of 500 soles, she will be able to buy more merchandise for her business. With more merchandise, she will be able to earn a little more and therefore save more. Her dream for the future is to live a good life with her family and her children.

El Jaibalito is a small town located on a very steep hill.  Almost all homes are located on the mountain slope.

You can only reach the town by boat.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually when a town is isolated the local culture remains intact and this is the case with El Jaibalito.

El Jaibalito es un pueblo muy peque\u00f1o que est\u00e1 ubicado en una cuesta muy, pero muy, empinada. Casi todas las casas est\u00e1n ubicadas en las laderas de una monta\u00f1a. Este peque\u00f1o pueblo no est\u00e1 conectado por carreteras con los otros pueblos vecinos ya que la complicada geograf\u00eda de las monta\u00f1as y volcanes no permite que una carretera sea construida. Solo se puede llegar al pueblo por medio de lanchas.\r\n\r\n<P>Usualmente cuando un pueblo esta aislado, la cultura del lugar permanece intacta, y el Jaibalito no es la excepci\u00f3n. Las mujeres hablan mayormente el Maya-Tzutujil y, como se ve en la foto, ellas visten sus bellos trajes tradicionales. La falta de exposici\u00f3n a otras culturas inhibe a la gente cuando ellas ven a un \u201cextranjero\u201d. El encuentro entre las se\u00f1oras y mi persona fue muy gracioso.

Ellas van a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en la compra de materia prima, hilos de distintos colores. Con estos hilos, ellas van a elaborar bellos trajes tradicionales utilizando la t\u00e9cnica antigua de telar de cintura. Las mujeres en la regi\u00f3n de Atitl\u00e1n aprenden, de sus madres, a tejer desde que tienen nueve a\u00f1os de edad.\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres piensan que el cr\u00e9dito si les sirve porque les ayuda a comprar mayor cantidad de hilo y con este poder elaborar m\u00e1s huipiles, independientemente si sus clientes le pagan o no a tiempo. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de se\u00f1oras que cargan una bella sonrisa todos lados merecen una oportunidad de salir adelante como empresarias.
