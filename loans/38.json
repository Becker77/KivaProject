Teresa rents out her garage. It is large and used as a parking lot during the day, and at night is used as a warehouse for merchandise for the women who sell in the area. She is owner of a house in a good location in the 7 Calles market. She is a mother of three grown children who are studying at the university. Her greatest wish is to see them become professionals. She needs the loan to enlarge her business, giving it more space  and building storage areas to give her clients a service with more security. The rest of the members sell salte\u00f1as, empanadas, beauty products, embroidered slippers, new clothing, candies and sodas and a motorcyle taxi service. In regards to the competitive ambience, the members affirm that it is strong but that they know how to change their products to items in high demand, or they change the place they sell to sell all their products.

She is 32 years old. Ester is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Ester owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting  vegetables like camote tops & other leafy vegetables. Ester has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ester joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ester has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Ester is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Ester from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 40 years old, single, and has four children aged 20, 17, 13 and 7 from a relationship she had a long time ago.  Her children are studying at university, high school and elementary school.\r\n\r\nNelly sells products through catalogs and Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes and ladies' accessories).  As well as national and Colombian clothing, what she sells most of is women's underwear which is very much in demand.  She works for five hours every day.  She sells her products door to door and to order.

She lives in the municipality of Narra, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing\/fish vending and rice retailing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,500. Elizabeth is borrowing PHP 18,000 to fund her business operations.  This will be her ninth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.

Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

Desde entonces, Elmer Jaime trabaja en fincas cercanas de su vivienda y poco a poco fue trabajando en su finca en una cosecha de caf\u00e9, yuca y pl\u00e1tano. Gracias a su buena experiencia en la actividad de la cosecha, adquirida mientras trabajaba en fincas, Elmer Jaime logr\u00f3 que su cosecha diera unos productos de excelente calidad, por lo que hoy se dedica por completo a la actividad de la agricultura con su cosecha de caf\u00e9 principalmente y la complementa con una cosecha de yuca y una de pl\u00e1tano. Elmer Jaime, actualmente con 50 a\u00f1os de edad, casado y con 2 hijas de 7 y 13 a\u00f1os, obtiene los ingresos con los que sostiene a su familia gracias a su trabajo en la agricultura, y sue\u00f1a con que sus cosechas sigan creciendo para que en un futuro sus hijos puedan tener una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica. Elmer Jaime busca que su cosecha de caf\u00e9, que es la que mayores ingresos le genera, pueda dar productos de excelente calidad para poder venderlos a un buen precio, sin embargo, la temporada invernal ha hecho que sus cosechas se deterioren un poco y se vea en la necesidad de comprar abono para las mismas. Sin embargo, Elmer Jaime no tiene el capital suficiente en la actualidad para comprar los sacos de abono que requiere, por lo que espera que un pr\u00e9stamo le permita acceder a comprar los sacos de abono que requiere, y poder as\u00ed obtener grandes ingresos para cumplir el gran sue\u00f1o de que sus hijos puedan acceder a la mejor educaci\u00f3n posible, y tengan un bienestar mucho mejor que con el que cuentan actualmente.","en":"Elmer Jaime is a person who has needed to work from a very young age.  His father abandoned his mother, sisters, and brother when he was 13, and since his mother was in no condition to work, he and his brother felt obliged to take charge of the family obligations.  Since then, Elmer Jaime has worked on farms near his home, and little by little he worked on growing coffee, yucca, and bananas on his own farm.\r\n\r\nThanks to his good experience he acquired working on the crops, Elmer Jaime managed for his harvest to produce some products of excellent quality, which is why today he devotes himself completely to farming, principally with his coffee crop, complemented by yucca and banana crops.\r\n\r\nElmer Jaime is currently 50 years old and married, with two daughters, ages 7 and 13.  He earns the income with which he supports his family thanks to his work in agriculture.  He dreams that his crops will continue growing so in the future his children can have financial stability.  Elmer Jaime is looking for his coffee crop, which is the one that generates the most income for him, to give excellent quality products to be able to sell them at a good price.  However, the winter season has caused his crops to deteriorate a bit, and made it necessary for him to buy fertilizer for them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Elmer Jaime currently does not have the necessary capital to buy the bags of fertilizer he needs.  He hopes that a loan will enable him to buy them so he will be able to have lots of income to realize his big dream, for his children to get the best education possible and have greater well-being than they currently have.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":985328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She sells them through house to house delivery.\r\n\r\nBeing an industrious mother, Sherill is able to earn a net income of Php 700 a week which she adds to her husband\u2019s income to acquire their basic needs and to finance the schooling of their children.\r\n\r\nDue to the high cost of commodities and school expenditures, they need to earn more to meet their daily needs. Thus, Sherill is again requesting a loan amounting to Php 8,000 to be used in acquiring more frozen foods for her to sell in their village.

Once the ducks grow up, she sells them in the market. Sometimes people also come to her house to buy eggs and ducks. Aside from the profit Rosario earns from raising the ducks, she also feels happy to raise them the way she raised her own children who are now having own families. \r\n<p>\r\nDespite her age, Rosario is still hoping that she can change the standard of living of her family through her business.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Lo que no le gusta es que durante la \u00e9poca de cosecha debe contratar la ayuda de peones, para cargar los pesados sacos de sus productos naturales, pero dice que la recompensa es buena, ya que obtiene regulares ganancias que le permiten vivir en comodidad con la compa\u00f1\u00eda de su madre. Como es muy emprendedor para mas adelante tiene planeado comprar algunas cabezas de carnero ya que quiere aumentar la cantidad de animales y empezar con la comercializaci\u00f3n y venta de carne de carnero. Es el onceavo cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP, y se compromete a pagar sus cuotas puntualmente ya que desea continuar trabajando, adem\u00e1s dice que le gusta el trabajo con su grupo comunal pues esta conformado por personas bastante responsables y solidarias. Tiene planeado invertir el cr\u00e9dito dinero solicitado en la compra de guano y abono que necesita para mejorar la productividad de sus cultivos y as\u00ed obtener mejores ganancias.\n\n","en":"Nilton, 30, lives with his mother in her home.  They work together to meet all of their goals.  Every day is new in the life of this tenacious youth, who works his mother's lands with a lot of care.  When he was young he helped her, but for some time he has done the work on his own.  He says that working in the fields requires a lot of dedication, as each day he must get up very early to plow and irrigate the land to keep it in good condition.  He loves his work, and he does it very well.  What he doesn't like is having to hire workers during the harvest season to carry the heavy sacks of his produce, but he says that he pays them well, since the earnings that he obtains allow him to live comfortably with his mother.  As he is very enterprising, he has plans for the future to buy some sheep, since he wants to increase his quantity of animals and start selling their meat.  This is the 11th loan that he has taken with MF, and he pledges to make his payments on time since he wants to continue working with the organization.  In addition, he says that he enjoys working with his communal bank, since it is made up of people who are very responsible and cooperative.  He plans to use the money requested to invest in the purchase of fertilizers that he needs to improve the productivity of his cultivations; in this way he can obtain better earnings.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":590539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy organic fertilizer to improve the productivity of his lands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilton ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":560,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588558}],"funded_date":"2010-09-02T05:46:28Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":230532,"name":"Nieva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nieva Agreda of Sto.

She sells cold cuts, beef and innards and also sells merchandise like shoes and pants.\r\n\r\nFor Milena the need to get ahead with her family and the difficulties she faced in trying to enter formal employment pushed her into starting a business that has made it possible for her to work at a job that\u2019s independent and sustainable.\r\n\r\nShe has gotten two loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo in the last two years and this Kiva loan is her third loan.  She will use part of it for cold cuts and beef and the other part for shoes.  She foresees the investment will be successful because she would be filling pending customer orders and she knows her market and has made presales which showed her the way to channel her investment.\r\n\r\nMilena is very happy because with her business and the loans she has reached stability in her income that has positive repercussions on her family\u2019s wellbeing.  Her dream now is to have a house of her own and with it a well stocked locale to find a spot to sell her products; this is her great challenge because for it she would need additional capital and this is why she\u2019s working and making the effort to impact the market and increase sales which currently garner a 20% profit

Maribel's main job is in agriculture, from which she obtains the necessary income for her family's upkeep. Her main crops are potato, peas, and other products native to the Peruvian mountains. She has done this for four years, working hard every day. The constant care that she and her husband provide means that they are able to make high earnings, and with this invest in the purchase of more agricultural land. She is now taking the first step, with the acquisition of a space in the wholesale market in Tarma city, where she recently started selling. She is making a good income from this, since it is a stable location. However, this is not Maribel's only work. In her free time, she prepares angel food cake and bread. She most enjoys \"being active and achieving her goals\". She is currently getting ready for her next potato harvest, and she is sure that she will have good results. She belongs to the \"Pioneros de Cumutay\" community bank, and this is her third loan with MFP. With this small loan, she hopes to achieve her goals.

She has a store in a rented space, where she sells handicrafts like ceramic dishes and figures, alabaster sculptures (which are traditional of the Ayacucho region) and \u201cretablos\u201d (small, brightly painted scenes of traditional Ayacuchan life maD. from clay). Faustina runs the business with her family, who are all artisans. The family has been in this business for about ten years. They make some of their own crafts, and buy the rest from other local artisans. Faustina is requesting a loan of 300 soles to buy more handbags and key chains. Her goal for the future is to open her own restaurant. \r\n\r\nNelva is 62 years old and married with four children. She owns a general store in Quinua, where she sells basic cooking ingredients like flour, sugar and oil as well as drinks, fruits and vegetables. She has had her business for eight years, and works with her daughter. They open the store from 5am to 10pm each day. Nelva is requesting a loan of 1200 soles to buy more rice, sugar and oil for her store. \r\n\r\nJuana is 41 years old and is married with six children. Like Faustina, she sells handicrafts in Quinua. Most of the work she sells is maD. from alabaster and clay. She makes some of it herself, and buys the rest from other local artisans.

She lives with her husband, who is 35, and their children: Sa\u00fal, 7, and Estrella, 2. \r\n<p>\r\nMariza was raised with the conviction that you must work hard to succeed. For several months, she has worked preparing bread, cakes and picarones (Peruvian desserts) and selling them on the corner near her house. She started this business out of necessity, putting into practice a skill she learned from watching her mother for many years. \r\n<p>\r\nThanks to the profits from this business, Mariza has been able to purchase some rabbits. Her mother encouraged her to buy two rabbits at first, then six more. She would like to continue buying more until she has her own farm. She wants to develop the rabbit business because she can do it at home and not have to leave her children. This is how the days are for this fighting woman who does not stop for difficulties, and has a positive attitude, especially for starting a business.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Mariza\u2019s third loan from MFP and she plans to fulfill it honorably, as she has always done with each of her responsibilities. She is very happy with her communal bank because all the members are just as responsible as she is. She will use the loan money to buy fertilizer for her father\u2019s farm, that they will plant together. This will bring earnings to continue pursuing her dreams.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":433616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizer for planting","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T16:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":475,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1368,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959907}],"funded_date":"2009-11-24T23:24:37Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"jeff hersk","image":384019}},{"id":160272,"name":"Mrs. Choeun Thinh Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is made up of 20 people who live in the village of S. in Takeo province.

With the support of her loving husband and children, Nancy ventured into a business of selling fish and slaughtering pigs. Both are sold from her rented stall at the Municipal market. Eventually, Nancy\u2019s life has changed a bit together with her family. However, she is still financially insecure, especially the thought that her five children aged 1 to 14, are growing and their needs, especially in education, are also increasing. Nancy is scared that the present profit her business is making will not be enough for her to sustain the education of her children until they graduate from college. With that in mind, Nancy now is requesting a much larger amount of loan to expand her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She had five children, each of whom now lives in their own home.  She has custody of two of her grandchildren, Roxana Yassiri, who is eight years old, and Axel T., who is six years old.\r\n\r\n  She is dedicated to her home and to her grocer's shop (Kendra), which she has had for three years, showing that the business has been successful since it opened.  In her small grocery she sells beans, sugar and oil, among other products.  Her grocery is what has helped her to cover her household expenses. \r\n\r\n  Since she didn't have anyone else to support her, Magdai's children motivated her to open the business by giving her the start-up money.  They wanted her to be able to support herself and to get ahead.  With this work, she has been able to do just that.\r\n\r\n  With the profits that she earns from her grocer's shop, she purchases additional merchandise to re-stock the store.  Her store always has a professional presentation, and her customers feel well cared for by her.  Her store is very popular and preferred because she has a good spot in the community.\r\n\r\n    She says that her dream is for her business to continue to grow day by day so that she can save some money to start construction on a room for her granddaughter.  She also wants to support her grandchildren in their education and, for as long as god grants her life, to keep giving them all her support.\r\n\r\n     Magdai became a member of the group through an invitation from her daughter, Se\u00f1ora Rosa Lidia, who is the group representative.  The group is named \"Girasol\" (Sunflower) because on the patio of their house there are lots of sunflower plants.\r\n\r\n The people who make up the Girsol group are the following: \r\n  Magdai S\u00e1nchez M.: she makes her living with a grocery business and requested the loan to purchase additional merchandise.\r\n  Yolanda E. Ju\u00e1rez: she makes her living selling tamales (a local dish) and requested the loan to purchase ingredients such as meat, dough, chili peppers and raisins, among other items.\r\n  Rosa Lidia Hern\u00e1ndez S\u00e1nchez: she purchases chickens from ranches to re-sell in the same area.\r\n Ilse E. Ju\u00e1rez: she makes her living selling tamales (a local dish) and requested the loan to purchase ingredients such as guineo leaves (from a local plant), meat, dough, ancho chilies and raisins, among other items.\r\n Yareny T. S.: she will use the loan to purchase Avon and Jafra beauty catalogs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marni Siegal, Kiva

Her husband Julieto A., who is 47 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 4 and 25 years old. Berlita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Berlita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy more peanuts to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and home repairs. Berlita A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

That same year his sister found him a job a the Libombos Hotel since she was an accountant there. In order to get that job he needed to at least complete 10th grade and he only had completed 8th grade by then. He went back to school and after finishing 10th grade started working as a receptionist, a position he still holds. He is a permanent employee, works from 7am to 7pm and makes 4,000 meticais. He spends his salary in household expenses and saves 500 meticais due to his finishing construction. \r\n\r\nThis loan, in the amount of 20,000 meticais, is Clem\u00eancio's fourth with Hluvuku. He intends to buy construction material (cement, sand, bricks and others). All four loans were for 20,000 meticais and used for the same goal.

She is married to a petty trader and has three children age 4, 7 and 12 years. \n\nIn 1996, Mariatu established her business in used clothing: underwear, dresses, trousers and skirts. She began her business because she decided to marry after the war when things were very hard for her parents.  \n\nWorking six days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 900,000 every month from this business. \n\nShe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 23 years old and lives very happily with her 3-year-old daughter, Liliana, in the house that her parents left her.  She has always been a very hard worker ever since she was a little girl, when she first learned to do artisanal weaving.  For 5 years now Nely has had her own weaving business, and she works every day without a break.  She went into partnership with other people who, like her, enjoy weaving in order to improve her production, and that way she was able to make her business grow.  Nely enjoys her work, especially doing artisanal weaving; she works very hard to make each finished garment, but she does so with great pleasure.  Her hope for the future is to have an adequate place to do her weaving, since she currently does the work in her home.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

(ASHI), a Kiva microfinance institution partner in the Philippines since 1999. She is 46 years old and is the mother of five children. She got married at the early age of 18 and only finished her junior year in high school. With this experience she was encouraged to engage in business so that she can provide her family with a better living and send her children to school.\r\n\r\nRodori joined ASHI to have access to capital that she and her husband utilized in fish trading, their primary source of income. As part of the success of their fish-trading business she was able to put up a store that she manages. The profit in this secondary business helps with their daily financial needs and school allowances for her children.\r\n\r\nAgain, Rodori is applying for a loan of Php 20,000 to buy an additional stock of fish for trading and fingerlings (small fish) for their fishpond. She is optimistic that their income will increase so that she can earn and save more for the expense of her children\u2019s schooling. She is dreaming that all her children will finish a degree in college and find a stable job in the future.\r\n\r\nRodori is thankful for what ASHI and Kiva provide to her family. All the blessings that they benefit from are fruits of the assistance and support that the two institutions offer. She is praying that these institutions will reach more poor but deserving families in the future and change their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":607915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

region of Upala in the Northern part of Costa Rica, minutes from the Nicaraguan border. Oldemar is a dedicated farmer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvesting of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. He works to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land he works is his own. In addition to his agricultural activity, Oldemar feels it is important to be an active member of his community. As a result, he dedicates a significant portion of his time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Oldemar lives is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Oldemar is working hard striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labor. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Oldemar and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Oldemar. The production cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Oldemar planted his peppers four months ago and will expect to harvest in the next eight months. Typically, he dedicates the hours from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM everyday to his agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial (PROPICA) is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Oldemar and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Oldemar, his family and community.

She is married to 33 year-old Yover and has 3 children.  They live together in their own home which is located in Santa Fe community, a small village in Kimbiri district.  Zosima and her husband Yover are the pillars of their family.  Since she was a little girl, Zosima's parents taught her to work on the farm and she grew up with these talents.  She currently owns 3 hectares of land where she grows coffee  and coca leaf.  These plants are native to the rainforest area of the Apurimac River Valley.  She has been working on her own land for 10 years.  At harvest time she hires laborers to pick her fruit so that she can harvest more quickly.\r\n\r\nWhat Zosima most likes about her work is collecting the fruit from her plants since this is when she feels that the months of hard work are providing her with some reward, in the quality of her fruit.  She considers that the most difficult part of her work is transporting her produce from the farm to the wholesale centers in San Francisco and Quimbiri.  This is where she is offered the best prices for her beans and coca leaf.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty Zosima faces is that she doesn't have enough money to cover, in advance, the wages of the laborers who support her at harvest time.  For this reason, she is taking loans with MFP.

She started her own business two years ago in order to support her husband with the family's expenses. She is a market vendor in Istaravshan town. \r\n\r\nMunisa purchases sweets from a local confectioner and sells them in the local market as a wholesale. Munisa, being very polite and talkative by nature, has a lot of customers, which allows her to sell her goods immediately. The inventory she has for sale is of very good quality and selection. \r\n\r\nMunisa is seeking to keep her business sustainable and has requested a loan of $600 USD to increase the inventory she has for sale. One of her plans for the future is to open a vending facility in order to expand her business. We believe this current loan will enhance the potential of her business and help Munisa reach all of her aspirations. \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is going to be her first loan, in the amount of $350 to buy cement, sand and rocks. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of seeing her house finished, and her family living there comfortably.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":385236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy construction supplies (concrete, rock, sand)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-11T18:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.11,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Filomena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":454.19},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":472.86},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":492.29},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":512.52},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":533.58},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":555.51},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":578.34},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":602.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":626.85},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":652.61},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":679.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":707.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":736.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":766.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":798.19},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":831.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.03},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.47},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.01},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.47},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.48},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.53},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.61},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":1389.04,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1405.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056873},{"amount":1.14,"local_amount":30.3,"processed_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:06:45Z","rounded_local_amount":30.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816767},{"amount":41.59,"local_amount":1109.13,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1122.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708948},{"amount":110.05,"local_amount":2934.73,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-17T07:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2969.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937985},{"amount":93.78,"local_amount":2500.8,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2530.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937986},{"amount":70.24,"local_amount":2036,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.11,"payment_id":128971960}],"funded_date":"2009-09-12T13:17:51Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Lucca","image":259290}},{"id":139639,"name":"Eron","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eron is a 51 single mother of ten children aged between 12 and 30 years.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Regina has 5 years of experience in this business.  Regina needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 tala or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Regina joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Regina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Regina K. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.87 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

The previous loans were for 12.000.00 MT and 15.000.00 MT, also for the same purpose.  In the future she would like to request more loans to finish her home and to begin construction on an exterior wall to provide her family with better living conditions.\r\n\r\n <br

She lives with her husband and her 10-year old son, Andres, in a house they own.  She has operated a business selling prepared food for more than 2 years.  It's work that she can do at home, making delicious lunches for her loyal customers.  She receives orders for meals in advance so she knows just how much food to prepare for any given day, a practice that allows her to avoid wasting any.  She likes the work a lot because she can decide how best to use her time, something that gives her a degree of independence but still allows her to contribute to the family income. She hopes to set up a restaurant eventually but, for now, she is happy with the business as it is because it allows her to watch over her son, Andres, who is still in school.  This is Deisi's second MFP loan and she is committed to repaying it on time.  She will use the loan to buy wholesale supplies of ingredients so that she can increase the number of meals she prepares and, in turn, her income.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":542777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy supplies for food business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-20T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deysi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":177.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934545},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":177.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673316},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":177.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887140},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:25Z","rounded_local_amount":177.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154152},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":177.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449464},{"amount":61.87,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":175.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588139}],"funded_date":"2010-05-22T02:22:20Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":205998,"name":"Ana Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana Isabel de 24 a\u00f1os de edad es soltera, habita en el municipio de Nueva Guinea junto a su familia compuesta por su abuelita y su ni\u00f1o de 7 a\u00f1itos que estudia 2do grado de primaria.

After the winter the crop is stocked for a certain amount of time in order to gain value before being sold at the large market in Tene, Mopti and surrounding markets, on a retail basis (and often on a wholesale basis) for cash to a customer base originating primarily from large towns.\r\n\r\nThe group members are expecting to  make a profit of 15,000 to 36,000FCFA, following the sale of their agricultural products; this will be used to repay the interest on the loan and to cover the daily family expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":567430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of intrants, grains and small equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sesso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aissata Seydou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Foune ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamasadi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kotimi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissata Baba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa  Dje ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Foune Bamke ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lafia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Araba Keletigui ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":480000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":480000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":480000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:42Z","rounded_local_amount":481641.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917822}],"funded_date":"2010-08-03T16:00:28Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":218288,"name":"Jenipher Achieng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenipher Achieng O. stays in Manyatta, Kisumu.

She earns her living by operating a fishing business.  Her husband, Santos C., who is 39 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 12 and 13 years old. \r\n\r\nMercedes joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mercedes has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 11,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $170, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more fishing gear and equipment so that she can continue to save up for future tuition fees and for daily expenses. Mercedes C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Juntos residen en la  selva tropical peruana, ubicada en la comunidad de Sirenachayocc anexo del distrito de Quimbiri, donde tienen su techo propio construido a base de madera y techo de calamina. Debido a la crisis nacional que aquejaba nuestro pa\u00eds en los a\u00f1os 80, la familia de Maximiliana estaba a punto de sucumbir, su fuente principal era la actividad agr\u00edcola, pero ante los cierres constantes de las  carreteras no  pudieron vender ninguno de sus productos, y todo lo invertido se convirti\u00f3 en deudas para su familia. Maximiliana con apenas 09 a\u00f1os se daba cuenta de las penurias que pasaban en esa \u00e9poca. Hoy es una mujer bien centrada y responsable de sus actividades y junto con su esposo se dedican a labrar la tierra; en su parcela tienen sembrios de plantas de caf\u00e9 y cacao. Viene trabajando 18 a\u00f1os en sus propias tierras, En tiempos de cosecha cuenta con el apoyo de sus hijos y de la mano de los jornaleros  para  as\u00ed avanzar con mayor  rapidez con las extracciones de los frutos. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cosechar los frutos de las plantas; ya que as\u00ed siente que los meses de arduo trabajo le brindan como recompensa la calidad de sus frutos.

El cr\u00e9dito solicitado es para la compra de abonos y fertilizantes para as\u00ed mejorar sus productos; adem\u00e1s en el futuro anhela ampliar sus plantaciones de cacao ya que cuenta con 02 hect\u00e1reas de terreno. Este es su tercer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, por el cual se compromete a seguir cumpliendo con sus respectivos pagos, adem\u00e1s se siente satisfecha por trabajar con su banco comunal. Con los 3,000 nuevos soles solicitados,  comprar\u00e1 abonos y fertilizantes para mejorar su producci\u00f3n.\n\n","en":"Maximiliana, age 39, is married and has two children.  They live together in the tropical Peruvian jungle in the Sirenachayocc community, an annex of the Quimbiri district.  They have their own house, which is built from a wood foundation and a tin roof.\r\n\r\nDue to the national crisis that affected our country in the 80\u2019s, Maximiliana\u2019s family was at the point of succumbing.  Her main source of income was the farming, but after the constant road closings they could not sell any of their products.  Everything they had invested turned into debt for her family.  At just nine years of age Maximiliana realized the hardships that occurred during this time.  \r\n\r\nNow she is a well-centered woman who is responsible with her business activities.  She works the land with her husband.  They grow coffee and cacao plants on their plot of land.  She has been working on her land for 18 years.  During the harvest season she has the help of her children and the labor of workers who can pick the fruit with great speed.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her work is harvesting the fruits of the plants.  She feels that the months of hard work are compensated by the quality of her fruits. She considers the most difficult part of her job to be transporting her products from the farm to the distribution centers in the city of San Francisco.  That is where they offer better prices for her grains.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan is to buy organic and chemical fertilizers to improve her products.  Also, in the future she longs to expand her cacao plantings because she has two hectares of land.  \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  She pledges to continue making her payments on time.  She is very pleased to be working with her communal bank.  She will use the requested 3,000 soles to buy natural and chemical fertilizers in order to improve her production.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":735721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy natural and chemical fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-22T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":248.08},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":261.96},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":269},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":283.02},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.64},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":303.6},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":316.05},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":330.39},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":343.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":352.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.96},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.05},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.64},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.77},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.94},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.32},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.14},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":90.96,"local_amount":248.08,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:17Z","rounded_local_amount":251.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196410},{"amount":96.05,"local_amount":261.96,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":265.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270091},{"amount":98.64,"local_amount":269,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":273.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550109},{"amount":103.77,"local_amount":283.02,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":287.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718784},{"amount":106.94,"local_amount":291.64,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":296,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350241},{"amount":111.32,"local_amount":303.6,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":308.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850729},{"amount":115.88,"local_amount":316.05,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":320.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665923},{"amount":121.14,"local_amount":330.39,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":335.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621085},{"amount":125.95,"local_amount":343.5,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:40Z","rounded_local_amount":348.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835287},{"amount":129.35,"local_amount":352.76,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":358.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245058}],"funded_date":"2011-03-22T23:42:27Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":287953,"name":"Angeline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angeline is a 43 year old widow with 4 children.

H. lives in Yavan. He is 55 years old, is married and has seven children. He has a secondary education. He has his own business \u2013 he raises livestock. He buys young calves, feeds them for 40 to 45 days and then sells them in the same market.  He has a shed where he keeps his calves. He has been in this business for 15 years. Raising livestock is a common business in rural areas. Currently, it is the season to buy calves and Faysilla wants to purchase additional calves, which will increase his turnover and bring additional income. Since he doesn\u2019t have enough money to purchase additional calves, he applied for a loan. He plans to repay his loan within 9 months. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jamilya & Keith Leitich, Kiva Volunteers. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0425\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432

In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. Who or what are \u2018kuku\u2019, you may ask. Kuku is Swahili for chickens, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. <P>Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons  raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":183613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional chicks and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-07-22T11:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-05T18:14:07Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-09-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":32603.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":317210},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-17T07:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":32603.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":348961},{"amount":26.5,"local_amount":28909.1,"processed_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":30856.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347893},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970466},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886683},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435945},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:03Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130249},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027082},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613122},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":32020.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010205}],"funded_date":"2008-07-22T18:14:07Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":61757,"name":"Beatriz Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p>Beatriz has been making hammocks for 10 years now.

Since their capital for the business is quite small, they do not make much profit. They hope to expand the business as the capital allows.\r\n<p>\r\nEven though they always want to save their small profit to reinvest in their business for expansion, they can\u2019t save any money for later due to the large expense of the family of five. Ganbaatar says, \"It would be like a dream come true if my family could live on land that we own. Hopefully, I will be able to send at least one of my children to a university.\" He requests a loan to buy more second-hand clothes and thus to increase their business capital.\r\n<p>\r\nTsetseghand,

She earns her living by selling the furniture made by her husband, a carpenter, and also by selling fish. Cadiz is a coastal city with a vibrant fishing industry, and many women have small businesses selling dried fish.\r\n<p>\r\nAlicia\u2019s husband Jose Jimmy is a carpenter. They have five children from 13 to 22 years old, three of whom are working and help their parents with their household needs and two of whom are currently in school. All of them help their parents with the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n<p>\r\nAlicia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to earn an average monthly income of PHP 16,000 from her business activities. \r\n<p>\r\nAlicia is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 was used to fund the operations of her furniture and fish vending. It had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is taking out her 14th loan, for the amount of PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to buy supplies for her furniture-selling business, and also to maintain operations in her fish vending business. Alicia is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.

Junto viven en la localidad de Alto Yapaz (selva central peruana). Cuidar adecuadamente sus chacras es su principal funci\u00f3n, desde hace 12 a\u00f1os le gusta ver como se desarrollan las plantaciones de pl\u00e1tanos, caf\u00e9, frutas c\u00edtricas, entre otros productos oriundos de esta zona. Aunque le incomoda tener que limpiarlos a menudo pues no le gusta machetear ni retirar la maleza, ya que asegura que estando a diario con esta actividad sus brazos le duelen, por eso prefiere plantar, fertilizar y cosechar. Por otro lado, pone en pr\u00e1ctica las t\u00e9cnicas agr\u00edcolas que le ense\u00f1\u00f3 su padre. En adelante desea continuar plantando m\u00e1s caf\u00e9 y pl\u00e1tano, productos muy solicitados por los mercados, adem\u00e1s de construir su propia casa, para instalar un negocio de venta de comestibles, donde pueda atender su futura esposa. \u00c9l pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLos progresistas\u201d, y este es el tercer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, donde comenta que desde un principio trabaja de manera activa en su banco comunal, junto a los integrantes. Juan, con el cr\u00e9dito, podr\u00e1 comprar plantas de caf\u00e9 y varios sacos de abono para fertilizar sus cultivos.\n\n","en":"Juan is 25 years old, single, and lives in his parents' home.  His parents are 50 year-old Pablo and 49 year-old Nieves.  They live together in the town of Alto Yapaz (in the central Peruvian jungle).  Juan's main job is to properly care for his plantations.  He has been in this business for 12 years and he enjoys watching his plantations of bananas, coffee, citrus fruit and other native products grow.  It is difficult having to weed his plantations often.  He doesn't like cutting or pulling weeds because he says that his arms ache from carrying out this work every day.  For this reason, he prefers planting, fertilizing and harvesting.  He puts into practice the techniques that his father taught him.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Juan would like to continue planting more coffee and bananas as these are products that are very much in demand in the market.  He would also like to build his own home and set up a grocery store where his future wife can work.\r\n\r\nJuan is a member of the \"Los Progresistas\" community bank and this is his third loan from MFP.  He says that he has worked as an active member of his group since he joined.  Juan will use his loan to buy coffee plants and several sacks of fertilizer to fertilize his crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":773638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy coffee plants and sacks of organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-22T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3024.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452399}],"funded_date":"2011-05-23T18:36:11Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}}]}
