(0) is a 50-year-old woman living in the town of Moataa. She is married and has four adult children.\r\n\r\nFiva owns and operates a handicraft business, selling general handicrafts to tourists and local community members. She has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 300 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Fiva joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,500 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional handicrafts to sell.\r\n\r\nFiva is now requesting a new loan of 3,000 WST which will be used to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts. The loan will be her 8th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

He became an orphan at a young age and was raised by his godmother. Since he was young, he has liked rock music. As he acquired music, he started to see that, with his love of music, he could open a store. Thus, he started to acquire merchandise such as tee shirts, hats, and bracelets with rock group themes. He also started to get music videos of concerts and rock groups of world fame. He also sells Play Station 1, 2 and 3 games and computer games. He could like to have a greater proportion of videos of rock groups from other countries to augment his collection. His job is to get the videos, make a copy on his computer, and sell it to people who like that type of music. With the money from this loan, he will buy merchandise in bulk: tee shirts, hats, CD\u2019s, etc\u2026 He is very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the trust given in granting this loan.<br

Domidia is a dedicated producer and mother. She plans to focus her efforts on the planting and harvesting of Cayenne peppers. She works in cooperation with her family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land she works is her own. In addition to her agricultural activity, Domidia feels it is important to be an active member of her community. As a result, she dedicates a significant portion of her time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Domidia and her family live is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Domidia is working hard towards the sustenance of her family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from her land as well as her labor. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Domidia and her family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Domidia with the help of her family members in the region of Upala. The production cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Domidia expects to harvest in the next eight months. Typically, she dedicates the hours from 7AM to 4PM everyday to her agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial (PROPICA) is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Domidia and other producers in the Upala community face, is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Domidia, her family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Domidia wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. She wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in her home and neighborhood. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":618399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase agricultural chemicals and nutrients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Upala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-16T03:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65568.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66661.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67770.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":15.31,"local_amount":7656.8,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-14T08:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":7790.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970543},{"amount":5.35,"local_amount":2673.4,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2719.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289987},{"amount":37.76,"local_amount":18879.84,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":19208.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206158228},{"amount":286.35,"local_amount":143174.51,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-29T07:55:41Z","rounded_local_amount":145665.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227043878},{"amount":55.23,"local_amount":27615.45,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:19:01Z","rounded_local_amount":28095.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238616099}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T07:32:51Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:19:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":242885,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary O. is a farmer from the town of Kisii in western Kenya.

Mel\u00e9ndez is 54 years old and has two children, ages 28 and 30.  Through her own efforts, she was able to study and gradually become successful in whatever she pursued.  This woman lives in the town of San Jacinto in the Department of Bolivar, where she uses her loom to produce beautiful handicrafts such as hammocks and woven handbags.  Many foreigners and Colombian residents are familiar with these items and have them in their homes and businesses.  This trade is a tradition among the people of San Jacinto, so Vitelia continues the legacy.  For the past eight years, she has been making bags, backpacks, individual table settings, as well as student uniforms.\r\n<p>\r\nVitelia started her business after she won some prize money.  She invested it in materials for making bags.  Vitelia hired artisans and began generating sales, first in San Jacinto, and then she gradually opened new markets to the south in the Department of Bolivar and other cities in Colombia.  Now when she ships products to her customers, they deposit their payments into her savings account.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a mother and head of household, Vitelia is proud of being able to overcome challenges and move her children forward with the help of her business.  She dreams of seeing them advance so that they can become successful professionals.  Vitelia gives thanks to God that her situation has changed.  Her son completed his studies and is now a teacher who contributes to the household income.  Vitelia\u2019s other son works since everyone is able to help.  She owns her home and is able make repairs with the help of her children and the income from all of their efforts.  By sustaining her business, she is able to keep herself employed.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she will use the funds to buy yarn for making bags, five bales of wool, fabric used for lining the bags, slide fasteners, and clasps.  This investment promises to be a success because Vitelia is always able to sell what she produces in the city or ship her products to other regions of the country where her customers can hardly wait to see what she has created.  Her business has three employees who work with her in her home.  The products are sold to stores in the community as well as to customers in the south in the Department of Bol\u00edvar and other towns along the Caribbean coast.  Vitelia\u2019s business has very good cash flow.  Her accounts indicate that she is able to collect payments each week.  Most of her sales are made in cash, while almost all of her purchases for materials are paid in cash.

She buys the firewood in localities around Sikasso and the fabric in Bamako and Bobo Dioulasso ( in Mali  and in Burkina Faso, respectively) and sells it retail. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she expects to earn a monthly profit of 110,000 FCFA, which will be used essentially to bolster her working capital, to contribute to family expenses, and to make repayments on the loan. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":263048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of wax prints and firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":32266.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440371},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135750},{"amount":32.49,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033551},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620919},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019884},{"amount":32.51,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242635},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:16Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678153},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112410},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028066}],"funded_date":"2009-02-02T01:42:24Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:14:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":90455,"name":"Ma.liza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ma.

Her main source of income is through her retail store. Aside from her store, she also owns a small farm lot. She hired someone who will cultivate and plant palay (rice plant) and vegetables at the farm.

If the loan is granted, she will purchase stocks of soft drinks and canned goods. Aside from that, she will utilize some of the loan to buy fertilizer for her farm.

Vicencias lives together with her husband and children, and the couple share household expenses.

All of her children attend school, with the youngest in elementary school, while the oldest is a high school graduate. She also helps to care for one sibling.\r\n\r\nJosephine\u2019s business activity is the sale of used clothes, and she has been doing this business for ten years. She started her business with 1,000 Liberian dollars and now has 22,000 Liberian dollars as working capital. Her business is located on Front Street, in downtown Monrovia, Liberia.\r\n\r\nShe says her sales are booming due to the availability of first class materials. Her hope is for her business to grow and transform into a building materials store. She plans to use her 16,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 80,000 Liberian dollar group loan to purchase more first class used clothes.\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Josephine Warner is holding the sign.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\n\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia 's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.

location in a cramped office to a larger, more inviting space across the street. The current location is so small that her customers have to wait outside to be helped.  The new office will allow her to help her customers more efficiently and comfortably. \r\n\r\nWhen she was 4 years old, Noelia and her family came to the United States from Mexico, working as migrant field workers. As a child, Noelia worked hard in school, and while not in school, she worked in vegetable and cotton fields with her family. When her father was diagnosed with cancer, her mother would pull Noelia out of school to sell tamales in order to pay the hospital fees. On the weekends, Noelia spent her time either selling tamales or working in the fields. Their neighbor worked as a notary public from home and started to teach Noelia how to complete income tax returns. The concept of working from home was incredibly appealing to Noelia. At the age of 14, she started doing the income tax returns of all the field workers for free so she could get experience. Noelia knew at a young age that she wanted a different life for herself and her family.\r\n\r\nAs a young adult, Noelia worked both in the fields and at an income tax firm as a clerk, and went to vocational night school. After graduating, she started helping people do their tax returns out of her house and it turned into a full-fledged business. \r\n\r\nThis is not her first loan from ACCION Texas. Her first loan helped her pay for computers because previously everything was recorded by hand. This upgrade was instrumental to increasing the number of individuals she served from 150 to 3,000 clients.  \r\n\r\nNoelia plans to eventually expand her business to more office locations in the Rio Grande Valley. She believes her business is so successful because she provides high quality work for an affordable price. She gives back by doing free tax returns for field workers who cannot afford her services.

She motivated and organized this group of creative entrepreneurs and plans to spend her portion of the loan on buying six head of sheep for further breeding and reselling. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Philippines. She is married to Jenard G., a government employee, and is the mother of three children. Two of them are still studying in high school while the other one is already married.  At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Adelaida, as she herself is an elementary graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nAdelaida operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP\u2019s-worth of cooking oil or an egg. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail piece rates. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her variety store, she is requesting a 36,000 PHP loan.  She plans to use this loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages so as to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAdelaida dreams of being able to give all of her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work in her business. She also plans on having her own rice retailing outlet and being an even more successful businesswoman someday. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group\u2019s weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis. The fellowship groups gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has a grocery store and wants to expand in his work by purchasing more groceries for sale and purchasing a new motorcycle to use for distribution of groceries to other stores and for deliveries.\r\n\r\n Ahmad hasn't enough money to pay, so he needs to take a loan from FATEN. When he gets the loan, he will be able to purchase more groceries for sale and have a better range of groceries, and be able to buy a new motorcycle and use it for distributing groceries and delivery aims. This will increase his sales and increase his income to live in better life conditions with his family. Ahmad is photographed in his store.\r\n\r\n About this loan product:\r\n\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Dorothy will educate her children and save for future use.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Namshi Farm Tec group will each plant  between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nThe photograph shows Dorothy with her group members."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":934338,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-12-04T14:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorothy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tamara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beledinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":49700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":49700,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":51261.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315681219}],"funded_date":"2011-12-04T19:04:01Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":369965,"name":"Nonito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of 4 children, Nonito works hard to support his family.

These textiles are intricately woven in a \u201cjaspe\u201d or \u201cikat\u201d pattern and are often quite colorful and detailed. Local women save their quetzales (the currency in Guatemala) for months or years so that they can buy one.\n\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank called \u201cRayos de Luz\u201d or \u201cRays of Light\u201d was organized by eight women who proudly wear the traditional colorful clothing of the area. One of the younger members of the group is 23 year old Berly, who is married and has two children who are 10 months and 2 years old respectively. Berly completed high school with a teaching certificate. She has a business selling shoes, perfumes and cosmetics sold by catalogue. She also has a small store where she displays and sells these items. Berly is requesting a loan to purchase a new inventory of shoes in a large variety of styles so that she can offer high-quality products to her customers. Berly is well on her way to leaving poverty behind and creating new opportunities for her young family. She feels very content and privileged to be able to have access to a loan with low interest. With her earnings, she is creating a more welcoming atmosphere to her store and has painted the walls. \n\nThe \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge, that combines small loans and educational trainings is of great use to Berly and the ladies in the Trust Bank. A Facilitator from Friendship Bridge, using games, role playing, diagrams and pictures, shares lots of knowledge with the women on a variety of subjects. \n\nKIVA investors, partnering with Friendship Bridge, are of great value to Berly and her friends in the \u201cRayos de Luz\u201d Trust Bank. They are well on the path to a more empowered and brighter future, that will not only help themselves but also their families and their community in Totonicapan, Guatemala.

This flour is always in demand to make a popular Togolese dish called La Pate.<p>\r\nWith this loan from FECECAV, Yawo hopes to buy another grinder that would double his flour production.

This is her first loan from Esperanza. \r\n<p>\r\nRaquel believes that hard work combined with her technical training will make her business a success. With hairdryers in her salon, she envisions greater profits with which she can purchase an inverter charger. With this, she can charge her batteries when the power is on and then use the charged batteries to run her hairdryers and other electrical appliances in her house when the power is out. Additionally, she would like to purchase school supplies for her children. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the long term, she views her prospects as good, and she dreams of having a successful salon with many clients

Her profits are helpful in improving their standard of living. <p>\r\n\r\nBelen became a member of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2007.  She has just finished repaying her previous loans from the cooperative and has applied for a new loan in the amount of P15,000.00 as additional capital for her school and office supplies store.  She hopes to soon transfer her store to a place near the school in order to boost revenue. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n\r\n

Salamat is the leader of this group. \r\n\r\nSalamat is 58 years old. Her husband for the last several years has been retired. However, Salamat has a daughter, who is 20 years old. Therefore, there is nobody to provide for Salamat\u2019s family except herself and her husband, who sometimes offers welding services. Besides, Salamat\u2019s daughter is temporarily unemployed. \r\n\r\nSalamat has a job as a seamstress in a sewing section. At the same time, she raises cattle together with her husband. Thus they provide for themselves, not depending on anybody\u2019s support. \r\n\r\nThey started out keeping cattle, just as most people do in their village. Then Salamat\u2019s husband decided to start trading in cattle. He used his entrepreneurship skills to start trading in sheep. Later, they obtained a loan and started increasing their herds. Now they have eighteen sheep and four cows. However, Salamat only manages to earn $45.00 US per month from selling milk. Salamat decided to apply for this loan to buy four sheep for breeding. Now they are making preparations for the feast in honor of their grandson. \r\n\r\nSalamat\u2019s partners are:  \r\n\r\n--Iygilik, 30, is a father of two daughters. To provide for the family, his wife works as a saleswoman, whereas he is an operator. They need a loan to buy coal. In the near future, Iygilik hopes to buy a car as he has been planning for quite a long time.\r\n\r\n--Sveta, 33, is a mother of two sons. She works as a schoolteacher and her husband is a leading specialist in an organization. Sveta hopes to obtain this loan and buy two sheep for breeding.

She is a widow and has two children. In 1998, Damilya bought a cheap young calf, which she raised and sold for a higher price.  She used that money to purchase two other calves. That is how Damilya\u2019s business was started. She has been engaged in cattle reselling for 12 years and has added more cattle to her herd. Unlike some other borrowers, Damilya is educated with a degree in teaching. When the teaching profession was one of the most prestigious ones, Damilya could not wait until she would proudly do her job. Unluckily, nowadays Damilya\u2019s salary does not allow her and her family to live a comfortable life. She has to concurrently work at a local school and look after her cattle. She is lucky to have a son, who helps her, so that she can get some rest from a chaos of every day life. With this loan, Damilya would like to get seven more sheep for a future reselling.  Her dream is to see her daughter graduate from college and find a good job and to arrange a nice wedding ceremony for her son. \r\n\r\n\u201cA good teacher is like a candle - it consumes itself to light the way for others.\u201d  How come the most valued profession has become one of the lesser paid in Kyrgyzstan? The Kyrgyz government is not paying enough attention to an existing problem. According to statistics, teachers\u2019 salaries are so miserable that most of them have to leave to join private entrepreneurship, which leads to a lack of qualified faculty in schools. Schools have to hire unskilled interns and it leads to a fall in standard of education. \r\n \r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She uses her income to help her husband pay the household expenses as well as save for a rainy day. As a senior high school graduate Sylvia currently sells provisions, spices, vegetable and various food stuffs in her home at Ve GoloKwati (near Hohoe). With over 4 years of experience in this trade, Sylvia sees an opportunity to expand her enterprise further. Nevertheless, she does not have the working capital necessary to increase her quantity of stock.

Because customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, the women lack tangible collateral assets, and financial institutions do not consider them to be credit-worthy. This leads to poor financial support and, as a result, limited access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. When a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys the equipment from the client, extends a loan to her, and then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a \"sale and leaseback\" arrangement.<\/P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":152092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of cocoa in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-04-23T13:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-07T17:12:11Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-06-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":231131},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-07-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":260209},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-08-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":289026},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-09-07T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":319327},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-10-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-18T07:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":351365},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347614},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970234},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886484},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:57Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435769},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":61600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130074}],"funded_date":"2008-04-23T17:12:11Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":49508,"name":"Thi Thuy Ha","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"N. thi Thuy Ha (MS: 070030) is twenty six year old.

She has lived in the city of Lima for 20 years. She lives with her 26-year-old son in her own house. For three years, she has sold various products like porcelain decorations, marbles and buttons in a small store she put in her house. She attends to her neighbors, who are her primary customers. Mary really enjoys her work, as it is very laid-back and allows her to generate an income to support herself. But sometimes her work leaves her tired because in the morning she works as a maid in the priests' house next to the parrish, and then works in her own business from 2 o'clock in the afternoon until about 10 at night.

Muidinkhoja is 27 years old. He is in the business of selling DVD disks. He tries to have all the latest movies, concerts of the popular actors, singers and others. He also sells cell phones produced in China. Being the owner of the business, Muidinkhoja  travels to the neighboring country, China, to purchase newer and modern cell phones at wholesale prices. For that reason, the retail prices of his products are lower than his competitors, allowing him to maintain a large clientele in this market. Today, Muidinkhoja is requesting a loan of $2000 USD. He is planning to purchase a large supple of DVD disks and cell phones to increase the quantity and variety of his goods. Muidinkhoja thanks all for supporting him and promises to be diligent in his loan payment.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Vaaipu  has many years of experience in this business.  Vaaipu  needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles & threads.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 360 tala or US $150 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Vaaipu  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Vaaipu 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vaaipu  N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.78 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.88 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her routine starts with the milking of her cows and then the process of separation to produce the milk that she sells.

He enjoys his work because he knows how to get a good harvest. Although it can be tedious, it is satisfying to him because he enjoys this rural way of life. At harvest time, Apolonio and his family must work twice as hard, because it takes a great deal of effort to harvest all the potatoes. He then sells these to wholesalers in the city who offer him a steady income, allowing him to live comfortably. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Apolonio would like to increase production and start to plant peas, because the price of peas has been stable on the national level, This is his third loan with MFP [the Kiva field partner] and he promises to be on time with his repayments. He also reports that he enjoys working with his communal bank group because all of the members are responsible and on-time in their payments. Apolonio plans to use this loan to buy fertilizers and pesticides to protect his crops. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":533575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizer and pesticides for his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-07T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apolonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2010.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886386}],"funded_date":"2010-05-22T18:40:29Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

She\u2019s a resident of a small Southern town: Kadamjai. Since early childhood, Gulbar watched her parents raise cattle. They later realized that they had to pass on the family business to Gulbar. Gulbar\u2019s parents have been breeding cattle for years and distributing their product to many local buyers. The business was started with only 500 soms, and eighteen years ago Gulbar took charge of it. Small investments brought some profit. At the moment she has two dairy cows and two young calves. She keeps herself busy every day. \r\n\r\nGulbar is married; her husband is an expert in a local firm. He also tries to help Gulbar with business. They thank their lucky stars for succeeding in this business because it helped them to provide a good education for their children. Their oldest son works in the US; their second son makes a living in Turkey. Unfortunately, the youngest son has physical disabilities and stays at home with his parents. \r\n\r\nEighteen years of cattle breeding generated proceeds to arrange a nice wedding ceremony for their daughter. Now they are working on the construction of their own filling station. Cattle breeding brings only 3000 soms a month, which is not enough for purchasing the required construction materials. The family hopes to get this loan to finish construction of the gas station. Traffic is always busy in their town, so they are sure that the filling station will always be full of customers and that they will be able to repay the loan. \r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? --- \r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She works at the business for nine hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by her husband. Maida currently earns about 150 USD from her business.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in the house that she inherited from her parents and hopes to be able to get ahead with her work. Her craft stand is located in the San Jos\u00e9 market (an important market in the city of Juliaca), which is very busy due to the attractive and original models that she weaves. She always receives her clients, who are primarily tourists, with a smile and she very happily shows them the crafts that she sells. What she likes most about her work is to weave as since she was a young girl she has had a lot of passion for this art.  She has been doing this work for 5 years and the most difficult part is to transport her crafts from her workshop to her stand as there are many bundles that she brings. In the future she hopes to have a larger store where she can sell her items with greater ease.  This is Mery's second loan with MFP and like she did with her first loan she is prepared to make all of her payments on time. In her communal bank she is very responsible as she is always up to date on the agreements at which the group arrives. With the 1000 soles she will buy more wool to increase the quantity of items that she weaves and increase her stand's stock.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":315642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-07T20:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596210},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:41Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990488},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211599},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:56Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641120},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080560},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":172.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996685}],"funded_date":"2009-05-07T21:43:04Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aimee Sostowski","image":null}},{"id":110983,"name":"Rosalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalie C. has 1-hectare rice farm.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Jaime has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. He is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase more livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be his seventh loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Hermelinda Gilberta O. T. is the leader of the group.  She is 25, and she sells fruits and soft drinks in the afternoons.  She takes this opportunity to sell roasted corn on the cob.  She started her business with help from her sister 12 years ago.  She sold fruit in the offices close to where her sister was selling.  The fruit that she sold was provided by her sister.  \r\n\r\nShe was earning money, and she managed to buy her own fruit.  She also sold sweets.  Three years later she was able to have her own small stand on 35th Street Galerias del Sur in zone 11 in the capital.  From there she was able to have a business stocked with sweets and fruits.  Her biggest wish is to be able to excel in her small business and stock it with imported fruits.\r\n\r\nHilda T., another member of the group, has had a tortilla business in her house for eight years.  Her family is comprised of five minor children.  Her dream for her business is to be able to have another type of sales like firewood and beans to offer her customers.\r\n\r\nThe other member of the group, Ana Rosalia T. T., has been selling tortillas for five years.  Her business is in her house.  She has three minor children.  Her biggest wish for her business is to hire another person to help her.  She wants to do this in order to take care of the demand that she has in her business.\r\n\r\nThese women are requesting this loan because they have many plans and dreams for their lives.  Therefore, they need the capital to work in their businesses. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":599226,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro Sacatep\u00e8quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2010-09-13T16:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda Candelaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermelinda Gilberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Rosaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000.08},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":999.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":999.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.01},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125.01,"local_amount":1000.08,"processed_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396346},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534901},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189137554},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414983},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195833576},{"amount":124.99,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201276106},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-17T07:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206397888},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211216325},{"amount":125,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216494696}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T00:32:40Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":234747,"name":"Catherine Sempeyo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Catherine Sempeyo K. is 22 years old and a widow who supports two members of her family.

She is married with two children. At the moment, one has completed senior high school. She has been a local manufacturer of palm oil and palm kernel oil for eight years now. Palm oil is produced from palm nut fruits and the palm kernel is a by-product of palm oil, which is produced first. The palm kernel is processed through various stages to obtain the palm kernel oil.  Palm kernel is used to prepare many local dishes.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>Her production is on a small scale because she has inadequate capital to buy machines for the processing. She wants to use this loan to buy more palm nuts to increase her efficiency to produce in larger quantities.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the money that she is currently requesting she will buy kitchen utensils; also she will invest in the carpentry shop, buying a larger amount of wood to make the furniture that has been ordered recently.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":385432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy kitchen utensils for her take out food business and wood for her husband's carpentry shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-09T01:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":262.4},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":265.99},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":275.03},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":287.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":299.13},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":309.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.61},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.88},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.07},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.51},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.58},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":92.61,"local_amount":262.4,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":271.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081321},{"amount":93.88,"local_amount":265.99,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":275.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997481},{"amount":97.07,"local_amount":275.03,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":284.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842827},{"amount":316.44,"local_amount":896.58,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":927.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734406}],"funded_date":"2009-09-09T02:47:15Z","paid_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":139727,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vilma is engaged in hog raising business.
