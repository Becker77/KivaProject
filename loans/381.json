It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a 62-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a general store and a fishing business.  She lives in Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1997 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and fishing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Lucia is borrowing PHP 23,000 to fund her business operations. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Lucia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upom a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She sells 'sopaipillas' (a fried pastry), empanadas, 'completos' (sandwiches), jams, cakes and comfits that she makes herself.  However, the kiosk where she sells her products is currently being fixed because it is in a bad state of repair.  In the meanwhile, she continues making sales but she sells firewood as well as chocolates, jams, cakes and cookies that she makes herself.  Adriana's husband and daughter help her in her business since they both sell her products at work.  Adriana herself sells light lunches and breakfasts that her customers request directly from her home.\r\n\r\nAdriana usually buys her merchandise in supermarkets.  This is how she stocks up with ingredients for making her products.  She buys her firewood from private homes.  Adriana will use her loan to buy building supplies to repair her kiosk.  She will also buy firewood, a chainsaw and a sink.  Adriana's dream is to move to a new home in which she can set up her kiosk.  Her motivation to continue in her business is to carry out her plans at the end of 2012.  Her daughters will start university and Adriana will pay for their studies in order to improve their well-being.\r\n\r\nFondo Esperanza's loan has represented a great support for Adriana's business since she will invest it and make more income.  As regards her group meetings, she feels very comfortable with her fellow group members and her advisor since they are very trusting and kind.  The training sessions have been very useful for her business since she has learned how to keep a record of her incomings and outgoings.

They live in their own home, located in the Pichari district.  \r\n\r\nMartina has a restaurant that has been in business for about 5 years.  She does not run the business by herself; she has the help of a cook and a kitchen assistant, and the support of her partner.\r\n\r\nShe likes it because it is not heavy work; it requires only her dedication and constant attention to ensure that the meals are to the liking of her customers.  What she doesn't like about her work is having to sacrifice on the festival days, because the restaurant always has to be open for service to her customers so they do not go elsewhere.  Martina finds the business profitable.  Thanks to her small restaurant she has made some repairs to her house, and she and her family also eat there.  The problems that Martina has to deal with include the water, which is only available during certain hours and delays the preparation of her food, and the high cost of vegetables and other products.  Martina needs this loan to buy products for her restaurant at wholesale.  In addition, she will use the loan to make some changes to her restaurant to make it more attractive.  In the future, Martina plans to make her restaurant one of the best in the area, and to open a restaurant in another location.  This is her 2nd loan with MFP, and so she is committed once again to make her payments on time.  With the 2,000 Peruvian soles, she will buy products to make the delicious dishes that she offers.  This is her second loan with MFP, and she affirms her pledge to make her payments on time.

is 62 years old and has 10 sons and daughters. As a child, she learned how to make bedding with typical handmade fabrics of the Carapegu\u00e1 area, especially since many women learn this trade from generation to generation in this city. They create these remarkable handicrafts that are highly valued in the local market and by tourists who are left marveled with their work. After getting married, Fulgencia continued making bedding while her husband sold them. However, it's been 5 years since her husband became bedridden due to a disease and she has had to support her household alone, with the help of two daughters who assist her in making the products. Nowadays, she supplies for large stores dedicated to selling handicrafts. Fulgencia would like to buy a loom and threads, using the loan she is applying for so that her eldest daughter can knit with her. At the moment Fulgencia has only one loom and since there is a growing demand for her products, she needs to increase her production. Fulgencia plans to increase her income this way and thus be able to help her husband through his sickness and give a better education to their two daughters.\t\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>Translated from Spanish by Isabel Tan, a Kiva volunteer.<\/b><\/i><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Sra.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":336806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase rice, soda, sugar, and beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-06-15T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madaraka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233191},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:14Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664984},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105696},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:37Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022806},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868047},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:02Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757243}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T20:31:32Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":119595,"name":"Linda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linda E. is 24 years old.

To make a living, Federico owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.

Federico is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which he will use to purchase livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be Federico's ninth loan from ASKI.

He is married and is the father of 7 children who are between 1 and 16 years old.  The oldest go to school.  He studied through 10th grade and then entered a professoriate course, which lasted 2 years (normal time).  He lives in his own house with his family and doesn't support anyone else.\r\n\r\nHe has never left the District; after the professoriate course, he was hired in a town 45km away from the main village in the municipality.  He has been  a permanent employee there for more than 16 years, and as School Director he makes 7,799 MZN each month.  He uses this to pay for household expenses and even saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nAlberto has had loans with other banks and decided not to continue with them.  He found out about Hluvuku through friends who are also clients of the institution.  This is his second loan, which has a value of 20,000 MZN.

She lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1997 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her pig-fattening, farming  and livestock businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8500. \r\n\r\nVirgilia is borrowing PHP 19500 so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Virgilia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").

She does this work based on orders from customers especially on weekends, holidays and occasionally for special events.  She home delivers her baked goods.  She has been in this line of work for two and a half years.  She also provides lunches for a group of senior citizens in the afternoons.

With respect to her house it is to repair it completely but she needs a lot of money to do so.\r\n\r\nFondo Esperanza loans have been very useful for Albertina to stay in business and rebuild her home.

Her parents where farmers, and now that she has her husband she also farms. Mostly they dedicate themselves to cultivating peas. First they plant potatoes and fertilize well that land, after which on that same small plot of land they plant peas in large quantities, with the aim to make the most of the fertilizer of their small farm. Plating peas is more profitable for them because it\u2019s a smaller investment, and for that reason they like plating that crop.

She is a single mother and lives with her three children, who support her very much.  She has sold food for one year.  What she likes about her job is giving good attention to her customers.  Her business is profitable for her because it is in a good location, and above all, she has a select clientele that likes the good flavor of her food.  The only difficult part for her is not having a location for her restaurant, since she has adapted a space in her house for it.  This is her sixth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.

They supply themselves at the grand marketplace of Bamako (capital of Mali), and they sell the goods at the retail level, cash or credit accepted, out of the house and in the districts of Markala, to customers composed essentially of women. \n\nThe group members envision realizing an average monthly profit of 28,000 francs CFA that will be used to help cover family expenses and to invest the rest in business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":276384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy pagne cloth ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kanou\t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanihan                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":21594.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033667},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":10797.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621035},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":10797.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020000},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":10797.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242745},{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":10797.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678283}],"funded_date":"2009-04-01T17:56:11Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":95035,"name":"Albertina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nEn el municipio de Cinco Pinos de la ciudad de Chinandega, la se\u00f1ora Albertina L. se dedica con gran esfuerzo a su negocio de elaboracion y venta de tortillas las cuales son comercializadas por ella misma en su localidad donde a diario se desempe\u00f1a.\n\nA pesas de las dificiles situaciones economicas que ella ha atravesado ha logrado salir adelante y para esto ha acudido a Ceprodel para ser beneficiada con un cr\u00e9dito que le permita la compra de la materia prima como lo es el ma\u00edz para continuar en su negocio de elaboraci\u00f3n de tortillas.\n\n","en":" \r\nIn the municipality of Cinco Pinos in the city of Chinandega, Mrs. Albertina L. works extremely hard making and selling tortillas.

They live together on the edge of the Peruvian jungle, in the community of Manitea Alta, where they have their own wooden house. For the past 20 years, Hilda has worked in agriculture, growing and selling cocoa. She recalls that she began with only a small parcel of land, which only served to cover her own consumption. Today, she produces and sells on a significant scale, dealing with large wholesalers, and in this way she obtains excellent economic returns. \n\nShe saved her profits and thus was also able to open a small grocery store with the aim of satisfying her customers' needs. In the future, Hilda hopes to expand both her grocery store and her cocoa fields, with the aim of attracting more customers and positioning herself better in the market. Toward this aim, she works tirelessly on her business. For the moment, she runs her store herself, though she occasionally receives help from her parentr. At harvest time, she needs assistance from hired laborers to get the work done and help transport the crops to the warehouses where they are sold. This is Hilda's fifth loan with MFP, and she is committed to continue being punctual with her payments. She feels well-supported by her communal bank group. With the loan she is requesting, she will buy merchandise to stock her store, so that she can satisfy the tastes and preferences of her customers. \n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":551627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buying products to stock her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-18T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3062.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326785}],"funded_date":"2010-06-18T12:10:57Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":210601,"name":"Benedicta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Benedicta V. tiene 39 a\u00f1os est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Ronal Ortiz y tiene tres ni\u00f1os de siete a\u00f1os, de cinco y la m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a de tres a\u00f1os, ella vive en Colcapirhua una provincia de la ciudad de Cochabamba en la localidad de Sumunpaya, ella se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de leche y elaboraci\u00f3n de quesillo.\n\nBenedicta es una persona muy trabajadora hace como dos meses atr\u00e1s la operaron de varices, porque ella no pod\u00eda caminar ya que le afectaba a los pies pero su esposo don Ronal decidi\u00f3 que era momento de operarse y verla mejor a su esposa y de esa manera ella podr\u00eda cuidar a sus ni\u00f1os y guiarlos en su educaci\u00f3n, pero ese tiempo de recuperaci\u00f3n bajo mucho la entrega de leche y elaboraci\u00f3n de quesillos porque su esposo trabajaba y el no pod\u00eda dedicarse a la producci\u00f3n de leche ella lo hacia lo mejor que pod\u00eda con ayuda de su hijo.\n\nElla requiere el cr\u00e9dito para la compra de cascara de soya ya que ahora ella puede trabajar m\u00e1s y si les da una buena alimentaci\u00f3n a las  vacas ellas dar\u00e1n m\u00e1s producci\u00f3n y ella podr\u00e1 aumentar sus ingresos y de esa manera ayudar con los gastos y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, porque ellos sue\u00f1an con que sus hijos tengan un futuro mejor y puedan terminar el colegio y realizar una carrera Benedicta sue\u00f1a con que su hija pueda ser una excelente doctora y as\u00ed ayudar a las personas de bajos recursos y en especial a los ni\u00f1os de su comunidad.\n","en":"Ms. Benedicta V. is 39 years old and is married to Mr. Ronal Ortiz.

She works in the production of milk and fresh cheese.\r\n\r\nBenedicta is a very hard-working person.  Two months ago, she had an operation for varicose veins because she could not walk, as it affected her feet.  Her husband, Ronal, decided it was at the point where she needed to have the operation so that she could get better, to care for their children and to guide their education.  However, their milk and cheese production has really fallen during her recovery, because her husband has another job and can't dedicate himself to their dairy business.  Benedicta has done the best she can, with the help of her son.\r\n\r\nNow that she is able to work more, Benedicta is requesting this loan to buy soybean husk to feed her cows.  If she provides the cows with nutritional food, they will produce more milk and she can increase her income.  This would allow her to help with the household expenses and to pay for her children's education.  She dreams that her children will have a better future, be able to finish high school, and become professionals.  Benedicta imagines that her daughter would make an excellent doctor, and in this way could help low-income people, especially the children of their community.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

To meet his large family's expenses, he has operated a grocery store in the Rwemengo Trading Centre for the last ten years. Mostly, he sells bananas and coffee. His business has done well but has also faced many challenges, including the absence of a regular revenue source. However, his business has remained successful because of Prosper's hard work and attention to customer relations. He makes 120,000 Ugandan shillings a month, and has applied for a loan to restock and expand his store so that he can increase his income.

This neighborhood is very far from the center of the community and despite being distant it\u2019s populated.  The residents are very unassuming and humble.  There is no means of transportation here because the highway is impassable because it\u2019s in very poor condition and when it rains it becomes very muddy and it awakens strewn with rocks in the road. \r\n\r\nSof\u00eda has six children. Five of them work and the youngest one is in school but she also cares for four grandchildren that one of her sons left in her care.  Sof\u00eda lives with her husband.   She\u2019s been married 45 years and she\u2019s 64 years old.  Her husband does not have steady employment, perhaps because of his age, but he works in his field and also as a bricklayer when needed.  \r\n\r\nSof\u00eda works selling cooked fish.  She gets the fish already cooked so all she does is get it and resell it in her community.  She also brings bread to eat and this is how she earns a bit of profits.  Sof\u00eda also raises piglets at home and buys feed for them.  She raises them to have a bit more and gradually be able to sell them.  She hasn\u2019t been raising pigs very long.  She\u2019s been doing it for about a year which is the same amount of time that she\u2019s known about FRAC.  Sof\u00eda tells us that she has to make the effort so that her house will always have food.  She looks for ways to always have something to eat and to sell everything she carries in order to return home empty handed.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":808708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cooked fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-07-19T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma Sofia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":937.5,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":986.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223521},{"amount":140.62,"local_amount":1562.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1643.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201803},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1315.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807393},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1315,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618488}],"funded_date":"2011-07-19T01:39:40Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":321244,"name":"Kenjegul's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kenjegul, 36, is treasurer of this group. \r\n\r\nShe has been involved in farming since she got married 11 years ago.

She and her husband support one-another.  She runs a small grocery store from her home and it is well stocked.  She says that things are going well for her and that she has steady customers.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for this loan so that she can expand her business, now that her physical space is getting to be too small and she wants to continue expanding.\r\n\r\nThis group was formed four cycles ago and despite a few small problems, they always manage to come out ahead.  Adela was the treasure when the group began and she always completed her duties very well and was very responsible with the members\u2019 savings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3825,"image":{"id":918726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

This meant that she had to quit her job at the store and start a new one.  About 20 years ago, she decided to sell bread in the mornings at a bus stop near her house. Unfortunately, she realized a few years ago that this job wasn't making her enough money as it did before.  This is why she began selling refreshments like soda and beer from her home.

She hopes to recover soon and attend to her business without having to ask for help (she still doesn't make enough profits to hire staff).

She is very punctual in her payments and her credit history is the best letter of recommendation for her responsibility.  The money that she requests will be invested in the purchase of the necessary materials to increase her production of embroidered goods in order to take advantage of the local period of festival costumes of her zone.  That is when there is greater demand for these items.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":366090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy textile materials for creating embroidered items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-09T22:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":148.06},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":154.95},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":163.22},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":169.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":178.2},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":185.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.82},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.41},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.37},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":51.82,"local_amount":148.06,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":154.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641706},{"amount":54.23,"local_amount":154.95,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":161.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081148},{"amount":57.13,"local_amount":163.22,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:48Z","rounded_local_amount":170.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997298},{"amount":59.41,"local_amount":169.75,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:11Z","rounded_local_amount":177.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842643},{"amount":127.41,"local_amount":364.02,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":379.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734218}],"funded_date":"2009-08-10T01:22:38Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"B Brown","image":120650}},{"id":131940,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose A. lives in Lumbia, Cagayan de Oro City.

At her age, she never tires of doing things to make money for everyday living. Her four children, Ludy, Gemma, Joel and Roque, sometimes give her some money from their salaries because they are now employed. But Conchita does not stop working because she knows her children also need income for their own families. She wants to be the one who helps her children's families, especially for her grandchildren. That\u2019s why she decided to join and borrow from Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), a Kiva field partner, to get the capital that she needed to start her food preparation business and her restaurant. \r\n\r\nNow, her business is still running, but she needs another loan to expand her business and diversify her menu. She will use her second loan from ASHI to buy rice, pork, vegetables, and spices. This will make her business grow.\r\n\r\nConchita has a simple dream. Preventing her family from experiencing the hard things will make her happy. That\u2019s why she will never tire of helping

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Viriginia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,700!\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 to buy more stocks for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and expansion of her business.

Considering the high demand for her products, Rosalinda would like to request a larger loan. \r\n\r\nFor Rosalinda\u2019s previous performance in ASHI, she has maintained a 100% rating in terms of repayment, attendance to weekly center meetings and her business. Aside from proving her competence to other people, Rosalinda has also discovered that she has the ability to grow her business and to be responsible in paying a loan she used as an investment in her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This will make her more income and she will be able to aspire to a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":746258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy paper, detergent, salt, sugar, sweet bread, candies, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Lourdes Col\u00f3n, departamento de La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-04-12T11:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":35.44},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":38.02},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":40.41},{"due_date":"2011-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":42.24},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":48.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":50.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.02},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.41},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.24},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.64,"local_amount":33.64,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-20T07:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":33.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206733295},{"amount":35.44,"local_amount":35.44,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":35.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211388602},{"amount":36.2,"local_amount":36.2,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-18T07:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":36.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216448774},{"amount":38.57,"local_amount":38.57,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":38.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221612832},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":38.63,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":38.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226982111},{"amount":40.48,"local_amount":40.48,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-20T07:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":40.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233430757},{"amount":42.33,"local_amount":42.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":42.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238545738},{"amount":43.77,"local_amount":43.77,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":43.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244505336},{"amount":45.11,"local_amount":45.11,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":45.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250712821},{"amount":46.97,"local_amount":46.97,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":46.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257115701},{"amount":98.86,"local_amount":98.86,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":98.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263240840}],"funded_date":"2011-04-15T20:59:56Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:26:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":292574,"name":"Ren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ren was born in 1953.

Mehriniso is 55-year-old mother of five children. Her husband is a driver, and they both are loving parents. Mehriniso and her husband are working hard to ensure the future for their children. Mehriniso has her own business for eight years already. She started as the seller of clothing. Gradually she is becoming more involved in this business and is dreaming of opening her own trading place. Now she is selling women's clothes and shoes in the store which is located in the central local market. <p>\r\nMehriniso is a friendly and polite woman. She is trying to diversify the range of goods to satisfy the needs of the clients with the various levels of income.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is the mother of four children, two of whom are in school and the others are working. She lives in Eguase in the central region of Ghana. Her husband is a crop farmer and has been very supportive of her. Life, she says, has not been as easy for her as she had expected, but she hopes and trusts in God that her dream of becoming well to do will come to pass. Hannah is very hardworking and dedicated to the upbringing of her children. She sells sweet potatoes and lemons, and it is from the proceeds of her business that she has managed to support her family. Hannah has mounted a stand by the major road side of Cape Coast where she sells her products. She takes delivery of stock from the surrounding farming communities and has been in business for twenty years now. She needs a loan to buy more sweet potatoes and lemons so that she can meet the demand from her customers. She would be grateful for your assistance.

She is 42 years old. Josephin is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Josephin owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Josephin is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Josephin joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephin has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Josephin is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 13th loan taken out by Josephin from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

With his wife Maria, he has two grown children, who are working professionals and independent.  His business is about 8 years old.  He was able to start working for himself with the help of savings he accumulated from jobs he held previously.  That is, his business is the result of earnings derived from his work as a traveling salesman.  Today Eladio and Maria run the business, and through their efforts it has experienced regular growth and stands up to the competition.  \r\n\r\nEladio has his own home.  He would like to purchase in larger quantities, to benefit from discounts and thus enjoy a larger profit margin from his sales.

After this experience, with his own resources, he started his own business installing alarms, locks, radios and selling sound boxes for cars a year and a half ago. He lives with his parents and his 4-month-old daughter who is in his care and is his greatest motivation to build a promising future with his business that leads to success together.\r\n\r\nIn his business, he sells car alarms, alarms and central locking, radio and installation, as well as making speakers and sound boxes for cars. His little working capital obliges him to make purchases in small quantities and with a lot of frequency because after selling the item, with that same money, he stocks and replaces the item he sold. This is one of the reasons why he uses crediKiva, which is the first loan that he made with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and with which he will buy wooden boxes, alarms, speakers, automatic locks, radios and tools to improve the offerings of his shop, where he offers the service of installing equipment, car audio systems and makes speakers as well. He dream is to position himself in the market, becoming known for the good quality service that he offers and for the products that he sells in his store since, currently, stocking is his greatest challenge, as well as not having his own home. While Andres builds his dreams, he persists in his work in a responsible and disciplined manner to achieve them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":774582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To buy wooden boxes, alarms, speakers, automatic locks, radios and tools to improve his shop's offer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-23T13:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andres Dario ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":76554},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80896},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":82446},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":84027},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85637},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":90440}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.93},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.47},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.39},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.93,"local_amount":76554,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":83459.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509513},{"amount":48.54,"local_amount":80896,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":88192.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673745},{"amount":49.47,"local_amount":82446,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":89882.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320307},{"amount":50.41,"local_amount":84027,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":91606.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803435},{"amount":51.39,"local_amount":85637,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:16:56Z","rounded_local_amount":93361.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614512},{"amount":54.26,"local_amount":90440,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-25T08:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":98597.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568475}],"funded_date":"2011-05-24T03:53:59Z","paid_date":"2011-12-25T08:51:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":304884,"name":"Yaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yaa makes soap locally called \"Don\u2019t Touch Me\" for sale at Abura.

She lives in the rural parish of Pifo in Quito, Ecuador.  She has lived in her own house in the Amazonas neighborhood for one year.  She has a high school education.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago she started a business of raising pigs, which she learned from her parents.  In order to do this, she rents a metal structure where she keeps the pigs.\r\n\r\nShe wants the loan to buy balanced feed and more pigs.  That way she will expand her business, which will improve her income and her quality of life.

They have 7 children between the ages of 17 \u2013 33 years old with 2 of them having their own family. Three are currently employed while the other 2 are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nConcordia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in buying and selling dried fish. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 10,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nConcordia is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 19,500 was used to fund the operations of her dried fish business which has had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is taking out her 8th loan in the amount of Php 19,500, which she intends to use on her dried fish venture. Concordia is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":498506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish
