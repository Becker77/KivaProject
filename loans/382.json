Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She wants to improve her financial situation and help her daughter pay for her studies as her daughter does not earn enough to pay for them.  For this reason, Ms Jacinta helps her daughter as much as she can.  Ms Jacinta also proposes to continue with the business as it is generating income for her family and she wants to be active and this allows her to improve her quality of life and provide a better future for her children.\r\n\r\nShe sells a variety of merchandise, such as perfumes, creams and talc.  She started this business to improve her standard of living and thought of selling to her colleagues.  She decided to sell cosmetics as it would be easy for her to distribute the products because she is also a teacher.  That is how she started her business, which her daughter will later help her with.  The financing will give her working capital to extend the range and variety of products she offers, as well as different name brands, such as Avon, which she would be able to purchase in greater quantities, to generate more income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva

This has not limited her capacity to work and contribute towards household expenses.  That is why, for the last three years, she has devoted herself to the sale of meals prepared at her house.  Without neglecting her home, she is able to maintain her own business.  Thanks to this activity she thinks she will always be able to support herself, and due to the large congregation of people in her area, she will be able to sell large quantities of her Dish of the Day.  The most difficult aspect is the preparation of large quantities of food.  \r\n\r\nSusi is in her seventh loan with MFP, and so far she is very content to be a part of this little communal bank and to be known as a responsible person.  For the holidays, she will have to double the amount of food she prepares, and pay attention to her orders.  In order to accomplish this she will invest the amount of her loan in various cooking utensils and groceries.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kvaka, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":251472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Compra de utensilios y v\u00edveres para la preparaci\u00f3n de alimentos","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-07T23:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2550.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640383}],"funded_date":"2009-01-08T05:35:42Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":86519,"name":"Jesusa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jesusa U. is a rice vendor in the remote and mountainous area of Cabisera 27, Hacienda, San Antonio, Ilagan, Isabela.

Tentunya hasil ini membuat ekonomi keluarganya menjadi lebih baik dari sebelumnya karena hasil ini mampu menambah penghasilan suaminya untuk membiayai kebutuhan sehari-hari. Melihat ketekunan Ketut Suriani dalam memelihara babi maka DINARI pun kembali membantu dengan pinjaman periode II yang tentunya memang menjadi harapan Ketut Suriani. Pinjaman ke II ini mengalami peningkatan dari sebelumnya menjadi Rp.6000.000,- dengan jangka waktu 6 bulan. Pelunasan akan dilakukan pada akhir periode pinjaman dengan anggapan semua babi peliharaan sudah terjual. Ketut berencana akan membeli 8 ekor babi pada periode ini, dengan harga per ekor Rp.350.000,-. Beberapa diantaranya akan dipelihara hanya 3 bulan, sisanya baru akan dijadikan penggemukan selama 6 bulan. Uang pinjaman ini juga akan digunakan untuk membeli pakan babi selama 6 bulan masa pemeliharaan. Tentunya Ketut berharap hasil yang didapatkan akan semakin bertambah sehingga mampu membuat ekonomi keluarga menjadi lebih baik lagi.","en":"The period of loan I with Dinari had completed by Ketut Suriani yielding good results.  Profit from sale of the reared pigs after deducting the loan from Dinari achieving Rp.200.000,- per month.  Definitely this yield improved the economic condition of the family over prior condition as this yield increased to the husband\u2019s income for covering daily expenses.  Observing Ketut Suriani\u2019s diligence in rearing pigs, Dinari is willing to again aid with loan for period II that certainly is hoped by Ketut Suriani.  This loan II will naturally increase over the prior one to Rp.6.000.000,- with a maturity period of 6 months.  Repayment will be at the end of the period with the assumption that all the pigs would have been sold.  Ketut plan to purchase 8 pigs for this period, costing Rp.350.000,-.  Several among then will be reared for 3 months, the balance will reared up to 6 months.  The money from this loan will also be used to buy supplies for the 6 months during the rearing period.  Definitely, Ketut hoped the yield achieved will continuously increase until is able to improve the famil\u2019s economic condition.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Pheng Tan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":287052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy piglets and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T02:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Suriani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":6000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":6000000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":6258259.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73591283}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T02:39:17Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T14:02:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pheng Tan","image":null}},{"id":98807,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria L. trabaja en el \u00e1rea rural D.

She has four children ranging in age from 15 to 24 years old. She joined Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI) in 2003, requesting a business loan because she has to augment her husband's sporadic income to be able to send all of their children to school until college. Her loan was used to finance her husband's livelihood of fishing. It has been nine years that this business has been Jocelyn's main source of income. She sells the fish her husband has caught every day in the market. Jocelyn has been able to have a hog fattening (pig raising) business from her profits. The profits she has with this business are twice as much as the capital. Income with this business is every four months and timely to support the semester tuition fees of her three children in college. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she is applying for now, Jocelyn plans to expand the fishing business and also to finance her hog fattening business. She knows she can afford to pay larger amounts of weekly amortization in ASHI if her business grows. Another factor that influences her courage is her very supportive husband and cooperative children.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nAlma is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Alma owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Alma has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP whenever she sells one of her raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Alma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alma is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase medication for her livestock. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Alma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

In the future, Anju plans to lift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.   \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal) and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold at the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Malama needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase goods such as , flour,sugar , vegetable oil and pots.She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 35 Talas or US $15 per week) to supplement her family's income.\n\nIn 2010, Malama joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Malama's second loan with SPBD. \n\n\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

He has been a farmer in Salitre his whole life. He and his wife, Luisa, are raising their 1 year old baby. Rodolfo hopes to invest his money in his land in order to improve his home. He is eager to make these improvements using concrete instead of wood which is vulnerable to heavy rains. On his farm, Rodolfo also has livestock, but he concentrates mostly on producing rice. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rodolfo is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming, plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despite its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention force.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worst when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, rice farmers lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":15495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Prepare his lands for rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-02-19T01:31:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-07T23:54:29Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-04-25T15:00:41Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13840},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T18:42:31Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19611},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T13:58:31Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26602},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T16:00:41Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36149},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T23:28:25Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47475},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T16:18:27Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59567}],"funded_date":"2007-02-21T23:54:29Z","paid_date":"2007-09-27T16:18:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":8687,"name":"Zehra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zehra is a local of the town of Beylagan.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\nThe successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She is married to Ricardo, aged 58, and they have two sons:  Joel, 20, and Jordan, 14.  She lives in the home which her parents left her and she wants very much to improve her situation and give her family a good life.  Linaria owns a clothing store in the Tupac Amaru market (an important market in the city of Juliaca).  Her store is always bustling as she has the latest clothing, ahead of all others in the market, and her prices are good.  Linaria enjoys her work very much, as she enjoys combining the clothing and dressing the mannequins, which always look very well dressed.  She wants to increase her store, increase the amount of merchandise she sells although she knows this will require a great effort on her part both to source the clothing and to transport it.  She has 26 years of experience and feels that now is the right time to expand and improve her life.  This is Linaria's fifth loan with MFP; she has always been very responsible in her repayments as she feels she must be a good example to others in her community bank, of which she is one of the founding members.  She will use this loan to increase the merchandise of her store by buying more clothing to retail.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":275791,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more clothing to retail","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-21T00:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Linaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":503.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117132},{"amount":154.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:06Z","rounded_local_amount":503.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012045},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":503.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595631},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":503.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989892},{"amount":158.59,"local_amount":514.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:48Z","rounded_local_amount":517.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211024},{"amount":149.74,"local_amount":485.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:36Z","rounded_local_amount":488.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640521}],"funded_date":"2009-02-21T02:11:00Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":94727,"name":"Aida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aida A. is a scrap buyer.

With her savings from HSPFI, she is able to handle the demands of her customers, both at the store and at the food vending stall, with help from her husband.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Ali is a very courageous man who is able to handle tough jobs like raising livestock and farming. He's the father of two adult children and with his son (who we see in the photo) is responsible for supporting their family and providing them with everything that they need. In spite of his difficult economic situation, Ali has been able to get ahead by buying animals to breed on his property. His main goal now is to improve his economic situation and provide a better way of life for his family. It's for this reason that Ali comes to IMON International for a loan to buy more animals to breed.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition.

Her main product is eggs which she sells to the local market. She also earns income from a kiosk (small shop) which she operates in the same area. Her main challenge is diseases which attack the chickens abruptly and costs a lot of money to treat. The high costs of poultry feeds is also a challenge to her.\r\n\r\nAlice has requested this KES 30,000 loan from Juhudi Kilimo to expand her poultry project. The extra income generated from this loan will assist her in educating her children. In the next five years, she hopes to have purchased a pick-up which will assist her in supplying eggs to the market.\r\n\r\nAlice says \"The duration of cheque processing needs to be shortened and

This district is famous for bus stands.  Raeesa owns a small house there which she and her husband built with love and care. Unfortunately, she lost her husband a few years ago, a tremendous loss for her. She totally lost herself in the memories of him. Her husband was the only breadwinner of their family but now Raeesa\u2019s three sons have started managing the financial expenses of family. Her elder son sells copper wires which are good conductors of electricity and heat. This has become the family business as his two brothers also help with the business. In this way they generate income for the family. They earn approximately 30,000 Pakistan Rupees each month. \r\n\r\nRaeesa is a housewife.

committee is in the San Luis neighborhood and during these two years of intense work has grown both socially and economically.  They are well known in the area for being very hard working women.\r\n\r\nThey went through a very difficult test last cycle because two of the members were unable to meet their weekly payments.  Their loan responsibilities were taken over by the group and they committed to raise up the group they belong to successfully once again.\r\n\r\nThe current group President is Benicia who manufactures clothing for women, men and children. She has her workshop in her home and is constantly sought out by customers who need service.  She makes items of clothing according to the styles the customers request.\r\n\r\nThis activity is very important for her because she earns good family income.  However, she comments that it is very hard work and damaging to her eyesight; she already has to wear eyeglasses for everything.  She wants to continue working in her profession, however, to continue to help her family.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for the loan to buy sewing supplies for her items since she offers quality fabrics to her customers.  She also has to buy other supplies like zippers, buttons and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

Of his children, 3 live away from home, while his 14-year-old lives with Severino in his sister-in-law's house.  Working the land and cultivating crops is Severino's life's work, and it fills him with great satisfaction.  For more than 40 years he has worked entirely on achieving good harvests, sending his fruits directly to the main market in the city of Tarma, which is called \"El Mayorista\".  He sells each 60 kilo sack of fruit for 70 or 80 soles.  This price has been very encouraging to him, generating very good earnings, which motivate him to continue working.  Severino relies on his wife's valuable help in the afternoons, but during harvest time the two of them work side by side from 7 in the morning onward.  They are eager to buy the house in which they live, and are resolved to work arduously until they can do so.  \r\nThis is Severino's fifth loan with MFP, for which he has renewed his commitments to make each of his payments on time, so that he, together with the other members of his communal bank, may continue to rely on the loans to assist them in their work.  He has much gratitude and great respect for his communal bank.  He intends to invest the money that he is requesting in the purchase of chemical fertilizers for his potato crop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":365171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Compra de fertilizantes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-07T19:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Severino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":850,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123986}],"funded_date":"2009-08-09T18:27:00Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":131630,"name":"Nen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nen T.

He is 51 and is the father of 9 children whose ages range from 18 to 28.  Two of them go to school.  He studied through the 4th grade of the old school system and didn't continue because of his parents' lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family in the district of Boane.  He doesn't support anyone besides his immediate family.  He left Matola for Boane to start a pharmacy business and later decided to move his home to this location.  He has owned his own business for 20 years and has 4 employees.  He makes a monthly income of 4,000 to 5,000 meticais and uses it to support his family, pay his workers, and save some in a commercial bank (BIM or BCI).  He has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through a friend and decided to request his first loan.  This is his third credit and it is for 15,000 meticais.  He will use it to purchase construcion materials (100 bags of cement) to produce bricks for his home.  His previous loans were both for 8,500 meticais and both were used for the same activity.  In the future he hopes to request more loans to finish his home and to expand the services he offers at his business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Vitolina has many years of experience in this business.  Vitolina needs a loan of WST $1350 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Vitolina joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Vitolina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vitolina F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

","en":"The communal bank \"Santa Maria\" is represented by Darwin, and is maD. up of 15 members who are working with our foundation in their 2nd loan cycle, demonstrating, as always, responsibility and compliance in their payments.  A great majority of the members sell products, such as groceries, fruit, electric appliances, snacks, and some have businesses, such as a bakery.  For example, Darwin works in public passenger transportation from 6 in the morning until 11 at night so that he can make a daily income and support his 3 children and his wife.  His wife weaves blankets and sells them on order so that she can help her husband a little, who works very hard every day to improve the quality of life for his family.  As far as the competitive environment, one might say that it is very strong, since many of the members find it necessary to take their sales to outlying areas due to the strong competition in the market.  Those who sell from their homes must wait for their customers to come to get their businesses moving.  In the case of Maria Luisa, who sells food, she has her boarders and does not have much trouble making her daily income.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy supplies, merchandise, tools and materials.  For example, Darwin will buy spare parts for his vehicle, since his springs are failing and he needs money to change them.  Maria Luisa wants to make some changes to the furniture in her boarding-house, to proviD. better comfort for her customers, who are the ones that generate the income necessary to support her family.  The main expectation of the members is to make their businesses grow so that their families do not lack for anything and so that they can give their families greater comfort in their homes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":480355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"working capital to buy supplies, merchandise, tools and materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3600,"lender_count":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Darwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Editta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Editha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeslee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Solange","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":3600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4048.4},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4094.98},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4142.1},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4189.77},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4237.98},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4286.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":582.97},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":589.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":596.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":603.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":610.27},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":617.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1172.65,"local_amount":8143.38,"processed_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:26Z","rounded_local_amount":8173.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909433},{"amount":596.46,"local_amount":4142.1,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4157.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909434},{"amount":603.33,"local_amount":4189.77,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4205.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945008},{"amount":610.27,"local_amount":4237.98,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4253.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945009},{"amount":617.29,"local_amount":4286.77,"processed_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4302.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945010}],"funded_date":"2010-02-01T23:03:12Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":177175,"name":"Mao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Mao E. and his wife, Mrs. Sophoin Auk (pictured together), were married in 1988 and have four children: three sons and one daughter.

The reason for this name is because these flowers grow in one of the member's homes. The group is situated in the Julian Grajales locality, Copainala municipality in Chiapas state, Mexico. It's also known as 'San Antonio'. The group is made up of 3 ladies who have known each other for 40 years. \r\n\r\nSenora Fredy is Las Azucenas' representative. She is 40 years old, and studied until the third grade of secondary school. Fredy is married to Rofino Farelo Sanchez and in total they have 7 children, 5 of which are under their care: Magdiel (20), Esdra (17), Lia Anilu (14), David (21), who is in the third grade of secondary school, and Yeider (10) who is in the sixth grade of primary school. \r\n\r\nFredy has worked selling bread for 20 years. Before this she worked with her mother, Raquel V. G., whom she supported doing the same activity. Now only Fredy makes bread. She is seeking a loan to purchase ingredients such as flour, eggs, oil, yeast, royal, cinnamon, margarine and milk, to continue her activities and to support her husband with the household costs, so together they can move forward and allow their children to study so each one has a better future in life. \r\n\r\nFredy started this group with her mother, Raquel V. G., who works selling clothes such as pants, t-shirts, blouses and shirts, among others. The other member of the group is Rometilde Hernandez Hernandez who sells snacks such as gorditas, tostadas and empanadas, among others. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Abura town in the Central Region.  Gari is a Ghanaian staple painstakingly made from cassava and can be eaten in a variety of ways. Kenkey is another staple made from fermented cassava and corn dough. \r\n\r\nAbena is married and has six children.  Her sale of gari and kenkey supplements her husband\u2019s income as a farmer. She helps pay the cost of sending their children to school \u2013 mainly school uniforms and books, and also some of the utilities bills. \r\n\r\nIn order to save up for higher education fees for her children, Abena needs to increase her earnings.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

She lives with her parents, whom she helps with household expenses. Although she is very young, she already knows what it means to work hard. She sells clothing in downtown Puno: she rents a shop where she sells her original, beautiful dresses, which are in high demand among young women, in particular for wearing to school graduation dances. Luz has two years of experience in this business, during which time she has lessened her family's financial burden. The thing she likes most about her job is giving advice to the young women who come to buy dresses. She always tells them which dresses suit them most, or which ones go best with their skin tones. She is a good saleswoman and hopes to have a larger shop where she can sell not only dresses, but also casual clothing. The thing she likes least about her job is having to stay at the shop for long periods of time. This is Luz's second loan with [kiva.org partner] Microfinanzas Prisma and, even at her young age, she already understands she must repay the loan and not fall behind on her payments.

Thanks to an invitation to join the bank extended by some of her neighbors, she obtained her first loan which she used to buy ingredients for the tamales: corn, banana leaves, chicken, etc.\r\n\r\nHer current loan will be used to buy an industrial stove and, of course, more ingredients for tamale preparation.\r\n\r\nThe goal she has in mind now and has had for a long time now and that she continues to strive for is to have an electric juicer and to open a juice bar in an area with lots of foot traffic.\r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to continue to support her youngest son\u2019s secondary and university education.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":525937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy an industrial stove and ingredients to make tamales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-05-02T01:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Petronila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":1900,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1912.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694161},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":956.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877126},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":956.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617098}],"funded_date":"2010-05-21T18:42:06Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":198036,"name":"Buhumuriro Abarihamwe Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A determined and very ambitious R.

She has 3 children: Javier is 22 years old and has graduated high school; Joselin is 21 years old, she is single and she is studying Sociology and English in university; and Ivan is 10 years old and he is in primary school. Eva requested a loan to invest in her cosmetics business and to purchase articles for the home. She travels door to door selling her products but clients also come to her home when they need to purchase a gift. Her clients are her neighbors, her acquaintances, and her family. She sells products such as cosmetics, perfumes, lipsticks, deodorants, skin creams, nail polish, Rimel brand products and household articles such as dinnerware, batteries, spoons and bedding.  She started her business 20 years ago when she was still single. Her mother was also in this business and she showed her and grew interested. She went to school during the week and on Saturdays and Sunday she would go out to sell her products to her clients. She set up her business with her own savings. She started to buy merchandise and today she is able to expand her business even more with the help of these loans. She is very happy to receive this loan because she will be able to add variety to her inventory. Her business is important because she is able to earn money and it is a distraction for her. She laughs, she cries, but the best part about the work is being in contact with other. She gets great satisfaction for have money. Her business is popular and clients recommend others to come. The challenge she faces is having to deal with fluctuating prices.  Sometimes prices go up. She reinvests her earnings in something she enjoys. She is planning to expand the variety in what she sells. She wants to start selling shoes and to reach her goal she will sell more with even greater fervor. This business has helped her financially and she has been able to send her children to school and bring about some renovations to their home.  Her dream is to see her business expand even more. She also dreams of seeing her youngest son continue going to school to have a career.  In whichever way possible her two eldest kids are almost ready to be independent. \r\n\r\nJantetelco is a beautiful place, cool and tranquil with a great deal of vegetation. They make candies from yams, milk, and berries. The members of this group wish to covey a note of thanks to Kiva and Fundacion Realidad for the support provided to them for the development of their business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":624583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase merchandise for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"JANTETELCO MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-10-29T19:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Misael ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlota","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Buenaventura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minerva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.82},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.82},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":869.94,"local_amount":10590.54,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10741.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554990},{"amount":539.95,"local_amount":6573.3,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6667.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691480},{"amount":315.11,"local_amount":3836.16,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3890.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430664}],"funded_date":"2010-10-31T11:24:45Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":247208,"name":"Karina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Karina, de 32 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy sincera y trabajadora, vive en su casa propia junto a sus 2 queridas hijas Neyla de 8 y Sof\u00eda de 4 a\u00f1os, quienes son el principal motivo de todos sus esfuerzos.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

to distribute contraceptives, provide health education, and go on home visits. Meeting monthly on the hospital grounds, they share their experiences and problems in the field and try to find solutions. They are being helped by the Runyenjes Hospital staff that has provided information about family planning issues and also supplied them with contraceptives. Other partners of the Runyenjes group include the Ministry of Health and numerous other organizations, such as the Chogoria Hospital CBD. In 2001, Kisumu Medical & Education Trust sponsored updates and trainings on a number of key issues, including family planning, the Community Based Abortion Care Project (COBAC), as well as first-aid and home-based care. KMET have been supplying the group with contraceptives as well as Nutriflour which they distribute to the community. The community truly appreciates the services KMET is offering through their partnerships. KMET has also empowered the group's members through its loans. Consequently, Runyenjes group's members have improved their living standards and health status as well as the severity of poverty in the community. The members are motivated and have been able to reach more clients with family planning services. The area where the group provides its services is agriculturally rich, and the main economic activity and source of income is farming. It is the case also for the members of Runyenjes group - 90% of them grow various crops ranging from tea and coffee, to maize and bananas. The produce, especially bananas grown in large amounts, is transported to Nairobi, 200 km away. A lot of money is spent on hiring a truck to transport the produce to the market for sale. The Runyenjes group is therefore asking for a loan of US$5,000 to help them pay for part of the distribution van cost so as to make product distribution easier and less

The dough is cooked first and then balled in a plantain leaf. It is boiled again for hours. Kenkey is served hot or cold with stew or ground pepper and fried fish. Agnes procures bags of maize from farmers in the surrounding communities. She supplies to retailers in her community and also sells on a table top in the local market square. She has been in business for over twenty years. Agnes wants a loan to procure bags of maize to produce the kenkey in bulk. She needs to increase her profit to be able to provide for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":263546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy maize in bulk, which she will use to make 'kenkey,' a local food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Offinsu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2009-02-02T02:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":63.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.46,"local_amount":127.28,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":127.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27132476},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":63.64,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:58:43Z","rounded_local_amount":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36028966},{"amount":190.92,"local_amount":254.56,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":255.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44615315},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":63.64,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53012621},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":63.64,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:17:31Z","rounded_local_amount":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53012622},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":63.64,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63234674},{"amount":47.7,"local_amount":63.6,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":63.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63234675}],"funded_date":"2009-02-02T03:40:18Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:03:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"April Newman","image":122414}},{"id":90679,"name":"Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis tiene 25 a\u00f1os y vive en casa de sus padres.

She is 36 years old and lives in her own house, along with her 2 daughters, who are 9 and 2 years old. They are the reason for all her hard work. \r\n\r\nCatalina\u2019s business is fuel sales, which she does as a street vendor. She goes to work very early in the morning in search of customers, who have no doubts about buying from her due to the affordable prices she offers. She is a very persuasive salesperson and almost always returns home with her containers empty. What she likes most about her job is talking with her customers. She has been doing this for 10 years and the most difficult part is having to be in the street all day, putting up with sudden changes in the weather. Even so, she knows she has to work very hard to achieve her goals. She hopes eventually to have a store where she can sell her fuel in more comfortable conditions. \r\n\r\nCatalina is in her second loan from MFP. She is very determined to make her payments on time because she would like to receive future loans. In her communal bank she is a very participative and is supportive of everyone else. With her loan of 1500 PEN she plans to buy more fuel and increase the amount she sells daily.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

She lives with her 48 year-old husband Rub\u00e9n and her 3 grown-up children.  They work hard every day to get ahead in life.  Two years ago this entrepreneurial woman set up an Internet caf\u00e9 in her house.  She starts working at 9 o'clock in the morning and works until 10 o'clock at night.  She is very happy because her children help to mind the business when she has to go out.  Although the business is relaxed, she says that she has to make sacrifices because very often her customers ask her to stay open until late.  However, because she makes a good income, she tries to make these sacrifices and continues to work in order to help her husband with the constant household expenses.  Over time, she has attracted good customers who keep coming back.  She has also managed to set up her Internet stations better.  In the future, she is planning to expand her business and she also wants to set up a video game rental place.\r\n\r\nThis will be the tenth loan which Luz has had from MFP and she pledges to make her repayments in a timely manner because she does not want to give a bad impression to the people who, through funding her loan, will allow her to continue working in search of progress.  Luz plans to invest the loan in the purchase of 2 video games in order to begin her future business which she says she will improve her income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":627985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

Don Juan inici\u00f3 a dedicarse al cultivo de caf\u00e9 gracias a que uno de sus cu\u00f1ados le hizo un peque\u00f1o prestamo de dinero y tambien le regalara una area de tierra, tiene 20 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a este cultivo y el manejo lo aprendi\u00f3 de su padre ya que tambien se dedicaba a los mismo. Don Juan se siente muy agradecido con su cu\u00f1ado porque gracias a \u00e9l ahora tiene su propio negocio y tiene una entrada de dinero para sostener a su familia. Su desventaja es que la peque\u00f1a finca no esta tecnificada y eso le provoca costos adicionales y el peligro de las plagas es un verdadero dolor de cabeza. Pero su ventaja es que el caf\u00e9 es un producto bastante comercializable y una vez que sale la produccion la vende rapido. El prestamo que esta solicitando en esta ocasion lo necesita para comprar melaza, fertilizantes, y pagar la mano de obra por la chapia de la tierra. Su meta es llegar a tener 10 mz de tierra cultivada y con el apoyo de este prestamo poco a poco lo ir\u00e1 logrando. Este es el primer ciclo de don Juan en FAMA y espera cumplir con el compromiso de sus pagos al dia.     ","en":"Juan Miguel is 53 and a small scale coffee grower. He is married and has six children, from 5 to 17 years old. Together with his family he lives in El Guineo neighborhood in Patuca municipality. Juan Miguel began growing coffee thanks to one of his brothers-in- law who gave him a gift of a plot of land and provided him with a small loan. He has spent 20 years cultivating coffee, a task he learned how to do from his father who is himself a small coffee grower. \r\n\r\nJuan is very grateful to his brother-in-law because, thanks to him, he now has his own business and an income to support his family. He feels at a  disadvantage in that his small farm is not mechanized, which causes him to incur additional costs, and the danger of pest infestations is a real headache. However, he feels he has an advantage in that coffee is a very marketable product and once it is harvested he can sell it quickly. He is requesting this loan to buy weed killer, fertilizer and to pay a labor force to clear the land. His goal is to eventually have 10 mz. of land (one manzana = approximately 1.68 acres) under cultivation and with the support of this loan he will be able to achieve this, little by little . This is Juan\u2019s first loan cycle at FAMA and he expects to fulfill his commitment to make all his payments on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":853371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer and weed killer and to pay laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Patuca, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-08-25T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10342.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257165372}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T01:57:46Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:03:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}}]}
