Since Merlyn had shown very good performance during her first loan, she is qualified to obtain the said amount. There is no doubt she will perform very well again because her husband, Eduardo, has been supporting her endeavor for the future of their six children.

However, the couple still thinks that they can surmount this life's test if they are supported by ASHI.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan Merlyn has received and will be receiving further, her skill in farming and livestock raising, as well as her husband's, will be put to practice and will be enhanced even more. Therefore, they are pretty sure that they will make their business successful because this kind of business was their parents' source of income when they were both young.\r\n\r\nHaving capital to grow this kind of business, Merlyn and her husband hope that they will be able to send their children to school until they graduate from college in order for them to have a different kind of living in the future. They know how hard it is being farmers. Small profit because of the low demand during harvest, and absence of a market can not compensate for the expensive farm inputs, plus the requirement of manual

mujer dotada de creatividad, que ense\u00f1a un arte del que  ha vivido siempre, a j\u00f3venes para que encuentren en \u00e9l una forma de ganarse la vida honradamente, como lo ha hecho ella ella desde que abri\u00f3 su taller de Confecciones en su propia casa, con el que devenga un salario para apoyar la gesti\u00f3n de su familia junto a su esposo, que trabaja como vigilante. Esta mujer es Alexi L., tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad y tres hijos de 22, 16 y 14 a\u00f1os, actualmente estudiando simult\u00e1neamente en carreras t\u00e9cnica, profesional y de bachiller; con ellos est\u00e1 asociada su meta principal: \u201cEducarlos y apoyar su formaci\u00f3n profesional, para que teniendo acceso a oportunidades  sean unas personas de bien\u201d.     \n\nPara Alexi, la Hermosa ciudad de Cartagena de Indias, la heroica, con su mezcla de arquitectura moderna y Colonial, ha sido el escenario perfecto donde se inici\u00f3 con una vieja maquina de coser y un mercado domestico entre vecinos, familiares y amigos cercanos, que le llevaban las telas para que elaborar sus vestidos; al principio debi\u00f3 pagar el servicio de fileteado, pues no tenia maquinaria para realizar esta operaci\u00f3n, que le daba el acabado perfecto a sus productos. Por eso cuando escuch\u00f3 hablar de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo a sus vecinos, no dud\u00f3 en solicitar el apoyo de su primer financiamiento para compra la fileteadora que tanto necesitaba  y telas e insumos con los cuales empez\u00f3 a elaborar sus primeras creaciones, para venderlas con gran aceptaci\u00f3n de la clientela; esto hizo que pensara en capacitarse e inici\u00f3 seminarios de dise\u00f1o de modas para el perfeccionamiento de su t\u00e9cnica y al observar como su negocio crec\u00eda gradualmente, se arriesg\u00f3 a  reemplazar su vieja y apreciada maquina de coser. \n\nAunque ella desea profesionalizarse en dise\u00f1o de modas, dice que su primer compromiso es ver a sus hijos convertidos en profesionales y ella debe esperar su momento, por eso est\u00e1 apunt\u00e1ndole con esfuerzos entusiastas a su negocio y se mantiene actualizada con cursos cortos que le permiten estar atenta a las nuevas tendencias de la moda y los requerimientos de su mercado.\n\nAlexi ha recibido varios cr\u00e9ditos de la Fundaci\u00f3n, siete de los cuales en la l\u00ednea de capital de trabajo y los dos \u00faltimos de educaci\u00f3n, que consideran son de mucha importancia para que ella no tenga que recurrir a agiotistas y endeude su patrimonio, como lo hacia antes de estar con la Fundaci\u00f3n. El cr\u00e9dito al que aplica y con el que espera ser apoyada en pro del bienestar de su familia, esta dirigido a pagarle el \u00faltimo semestre universitario en la carrera de contadur\u00eda Publica a James, su hijo mayor, quien sin graduarse trabaja como auxiliar contable y se prepara para ayudar a que sus hermanos alcancen sus sue\u00f1os educativos.\n\nDesde su vinculaci\u00f3n al programa de la Fundaci\u00f3n, Alexi ha visto su negocio crecer, pudo renovar su maquinaria de confecci\u00f3n y ha sacado a sus hijos adelante especialmente en lo relacionado con la educaci\u00f3n. Su principal desaf\u00edo familiar siempre ha sido el cumplimiento con la multiplicidad de sus rolles como esposa, madre y empresaria; Ella considera que la educaci\u00f3n de los hijos es tarea de los padres y no las delega como ocurre cuando ambos padres trabajan.\n\nAlexi y su esposo han levantado a sus hijos en el barrio Campestre, ubicado en el suroccidente de la hermosa Cartagena, este un lugar modesto con calles angostas, vecinos solidarios, muchos escenarios deportivos y una pista de patinaje p\u00fablico, donde la comunidad ha visto de cerca los juegos Centroamericanos y del Caribe. En el escenario del barrio Campestre, es com\u00fan  ver los vecinos practicando el patinaje, por eso se ha convertido en el semillero de futuras estrellas de este deporte, en el que Colombia se destaca con la muy joven  Cecilia \u201cla Chechi Baena, que se mantiene arrasando con medallas en cada mundial  y ha sido 6 veces campeona en la m\u00e1xima categor\u00eda del patinaje en l\u00ednea; la Chechi como todos la llaman, es la insignia y el par\u00e1metro que impulsa a muchos j\u00f3venes de la comunidad a progresar, este es el ambiente donde tambi\u00e9n Alexi y su esposo ha educado a sus tres hijos.\n","en":"In a seamstress shop in the Campestre neighborhood of the city of Cartagena, there is a woman who is gifted with creativity.  She teaches the art, which she has always had, to youngsters. She does this so that they can, through their creativity, find an honorable way of earning a living like she has done.  She opened her seamstress shop in her own house, and she earns a salary to help her husband support the family.  Her husband is a watchman.\r\n\r\nThis woman is Alexi L\u00f3pex.  She is 42, and she has three children; 22, 16, and 14.  The children are currently simultaneously studying a technical career, a professional career, and a high school degree.  Her primary goal for them is, \u201cTo educate them and support their professional training so that they have access to opportunities and become \r\ngood people\u201d.\r\n\r\nFor Alexi, the beautiful city of Cartagena de Indias, the heroic, with its mixture of modern and colonial architecture, has been the perfect place to start with an old sewing machine and a domestic market among her neighbors, family, and close friends.  They brought her fabrics in order for her to make their clothes.  At first she had to pay for the finishing service because she did not have a machine to do this operation and give a perfect finishing to her products.  That is why when she heard her neighbors talking about the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation; she did not hesitate in asking for the support of her first loan to buy an overlock sewing machine, which she needed so much.  She also needed fabrics and supplies to make her first creations.  They were widely accepted by the customers who bought them.  This made her think of training, and she started fashion design seminars to perfect her technique.  She saw how her business gradually grew, and she took a chance on replacing her prized old sewing machine.\r\n\r\nEven though she wishes to become a professional in fashion design, she says that her first commitment is to see her children become professionals.  She needs to wait for her time.  That is why she is enthusiastically putting her efforts into her business.  She stays fulfilled with short courses that allow her to be aware of the new fashion trends and the market\u2019s requirements.\r\n\r\nAlexi has received various loans from the Foundation.  Seven of them have been for working capital.  The last two have been for education.  She considers them to be very important so that she does not have to go to moneylenders and put up her assets for the debt.  This is what she did before she was with the Foundation.  The loan she is asking for and hopes to receive for her family\u2019s well being is to pay for the last the last semester of study in the university for her oldest son, James.  He is studying for a career in Public Accounting.  Without graduating he works as an accounting assistant.  He is preparing to help his sibling reach their educational dreams.\r\n\r\nAlexi has seen her business grow since joining the program with the Foundation.  She was able to renovate her sewing machinery, and she has been able to get her children ahead, especially in the area of education.  Her main family challenge has always been fulfilling her multiple rolls as wife, mother, and business person.  She considers the education of the children to be the parents\u2019 job, and she does not delegate that as it happens when both parents work.\r\n\r\nAlexi and her husband have raised their children in the Campestre neighborhood, which is southwest of the beautiful Cartagena.  It is a modest place with narrow streets, united neighbors, many sporting areas, and a public skating rink where the community has seen the Central American games of the Caribbean up close.  In the Campestre neighborhood it is common to see the neighbors practicing their skating, and it has become the source of future stars of this sport.

To diversify his income stream, Santiago has kept his eyes and ears open about different market opportunities, this has led him to expand to pumpkin, a high-demand crop on the neighboring Guatemala market. Moreover, there is pre-harvest financing for pumpkin, whereas until now there were virtually no financing mechanisms in place for cacao farmers. Santiago has been investing his income in home improvement and diversifying his food supply, such as his recently installed small-scale tilapia ponds.\n\nCacao farming has proved to be risky business for Santiago, whose crop was devastated by Hurricane Iris in 2001, and again in 2007 by a fire that spread from a neighboring farm. Persistent in his efforts, however, he replanted every time, and even transplanted 500 new seedlings in September of 2012 to expand his cacao farm, which has 30-year-old trees. Cacao trees take three to five years to begin producing pods and continue at full capacity for 60-70 years.

lives on a farm with her husband and her only child who is now 17. Together they all work to produce rice. She has lived in Baba her entire life and she has survived from her agricultural production. She hopes to take out a loan in order to buy fertilizer and pesticides that will help her nurture her crops. With the profits, she hopes to make some improvements to her home. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of one the new Communal Banks formed in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Progresista Baba Communal Bank are part of an association of rice farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their organization, La Asociacion Montubia Progresista, works cooperatively to help their members cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. Specifically, they help farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Montubia Progresista have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of La Asociacion Montubia Progresista de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling viands, binignit (a local delicacy) and barbecue (grilled meat) in the local community. Gina has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business and some funds were used for their daily needs. Gina is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering and engage in the buying and selling of gold dust in their local community. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Gina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children and supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She has managed to access two loans from Kadet Ltd., which she paid well without any difficulties. She is a client with a good credit history with us. She is looking for Kiva lenders to enable her to get a loan which will help her buy more medicine for her chemist business.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to own a big chemist in the future and have contracts with Insurance companies. This will enable her to increase her clientele, which in return will boost her business. She also hopes that when her first son finishes high school, he will take medical training so as to take up the business and expand it.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":491004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To buy more medicine to stock her pharmacy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisumu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.1 34.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2010-02-21T11:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice Ligare","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:22:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5116.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128976994},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2558.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136703246},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:59:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2558.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151921263},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-19T09:11:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5116.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160095720},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5116.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177438888},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:42:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2558.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182578251},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2558.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188713509},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5116.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191451849}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T13:43:30Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:23:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":181674,"name":"Catherine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Catherine is 45 years old.

She also hopes to buy a house, the reason for her scheduled savings, and to be able to take advantage of the subsidy granted by the state, and that, precisely, is her biggest challenge.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marni Siegal, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":543288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Upholstery","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase raw materials like fabric and wood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-05-22T02:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":199641},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200050},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200309}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.82},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.03},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":99.82,"local_amount":199641,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":199641,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895873},{"amount":100.03,"local_amount":200050,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":200050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636203},{"amount":100.15,"local_amount":200309,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":200309,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850298}],"funded_date":"2010-05-22T04:19:18Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":206357,"name":"Lindie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lindie G. is from the village of Mitiomos.

She puts the dough in a sack with heavy stones placed on it to drain the starch out of the dough and leaves the dough for a day or two depending on the weight of the stones. After this process she stir-fries it in a pan on the fire for some time to produce gari. The gari is then left to cool and is bagged into sacks for sale.\r\n\r\nGari is one of the starchy foods in Ghana that is mostly enjoyed by students and families at large. Students eat gari a lot because it is a quick and easy food to prepare. They use it for soakings (gari mixed with sugar, milk and water and sometimes peanuts). Some students also prepare gari in the form of a dough and eat it with pepper sauces and sardines.\r\n\r\nFamilies also eat gari as lunch or supper with soups or sauces. The soups that are mostly used with gari are okra soup, groundnut (peanut) soup, palm nut soup, vegetable soups and so on. On the other hand, various sauces can also be used with gari such as pepper sauce, curry sauce, tomato sauce and other varieties of sauce, depending on the family. Any kind of meat or fish can also be eaten with these soups and sauces.\r\n\r\nAma has no educational background. She is married and takes care of her six dependents. Her loan will be invested into her gari business to expand it. This she will do by buying more cassava to process into gari to distribute. She plans to build a storehouse in which to keep her increased amount of gari.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":568083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

However, in carrying out her work she discovered a workshop which makes brand-name sneakers.  Now she sells brand-name sneakers as a street vendor on the outskirts of a very busy market in the city.  She has been in this business for seven years and it is doing very well which makes her feel happy.  However, she also feels very annoyed because she frequently has to change location as the people who work for the city don't allow her to stay in the same place for long.\r\n\r\nAs Sandra is an enterprising woman, in the future she would like to buy a stall in the market where she can sell her products as she doesn't want to lose her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is Sandra's tenth loan from MFP and she pledges to be responsible in making her repayments as she doesn't want to let down the people who have made it possible for her to receive the money that will allow her to keep working.  Sandra plans to invest her loan money in buying sneakers and sandals as she would like to sell them during the summer season.  In this way, she hopes to improve her profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":687672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy sneakers and sandals to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-07T22:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":64.87},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":67.8},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":72.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":76.27},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":80.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":84.45},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":87.51},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":91.58},{"due_date":"2011-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":96.3},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":104.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.07},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.6},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.74},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":24.33,"local_amount":64.87,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":68.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463768},{"amount":25.42,"local_amount":67.8,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":71.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887156},{"amount":27.07,"local_amount":72.17,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":75.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327517},{"amount":27.33,"local_amount":72.88,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":76.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196062},{"amount":28.6,"local_amount":76.27,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":80.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269745},{"amount":30.3,"local_amount":80.81,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":84.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549751},{"amount":31.67,"local_amount":84.45,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":88.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718421},{"amount":32.82,"local_amount":87.51,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349982},{"amount":34.34,"local_amount":91.58,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":96.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850525},{"amount":36.11,"local_amount":96.3,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:38Z","rounded_local_amount":101.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665779},{"amount":37.74,"local_amount":100.63,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:20Z","rounded_local_amount":105.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244620953},{"amount":39.27,"local_amount":104.73,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:42Z","rounded_local_amount":110.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835182}],"funded_date":"2011-01-08T21:56:42Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":267820,"name":"Musingi Bora Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Antoinette K.

She had to buy everything and also had to move home. \r\nShe will use the loan to buy clothes, white and wholemeal flour, and oil and salt. \r\nHer greatest dreams are to pay her monthly expenses and live quietly and in harmony with her family. Hence her motivation to continue with these different businesses. \r\nPatricia lives with her daughters who are 28 and 27 years old as well as her 4 year old granddaughter. She feels very supported by her entire family.\r\nPatricia is very happy and grateful for the loan from Fondo Esperanza, as this will be invested in all her businesses and generate greater income. She also comments that Fondo Esperanza offered her a lot of help after the earthquake. With respect to the bank meetings, there is much camaraderie, and they serve as a distraction and opportunity to pass some pleasant time together.

He grew up in a very large family, with 3 sisters and 3 brothers while his parents were simple workers. After finishing high school Omburek was trained as a tractor driver and helped his parents with their farm. In 1985 Omburek  married and chose to remain living with his parents who were raising cattle and farming at the time. His first daughter was born in 1985 and in 1995 Omburek became a father of a second girl. After working with the community farm (kolhoz) for three years Omburek decided to start his own farm. He used a starting sum of 10,000 som (KGS) to purchase a cow and start his cattle raising business. At first Omburek has fallen on hard times, as towards the end of the 90s his family grew to six people and he was struggling to provide for clothing and shoes, while his wife had to stay home and take care of the little ones. After the fall of the Soviet Union his community farm fell apart and the money Omburek was making was barely enough to purchase food for everyone. At that time Omburek decided to also start farming, and began growing sugar beets at his house plot. He was selling his harvest to the local sugar factory and using the profits to purchase more livestock. Now Omburek's household has flourished and he owns two milk cows, two heifers and a calf and he also offers his tractor driving skills during the planting season to the other local farmers. His wife is now able to help a lot more with the farm as two of his five children are already in college while the youngest three are all attending school. Omburek himself is not only a good businessman but also a wonderful loving husband and father.\r\n\r\nIn order to further expand his livestock business and purchase more animals, Omburek has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS). In the future Omburek dreams of expanding his farm as well and buying new farming equipment for himself. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":935087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Panfilovka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-02T18:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Omurbek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5070.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370768},{"amount":108.34,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5070.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285435},{"amount":325,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":15211.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301339025},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5070.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095379},{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":30423.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938377}],"funded_date":"2011-12-21T02:51:38Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:17:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":370301,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Gladys es cliente antigua de la instituci\u00f3n,  ya trabaja tres secuencias, en sus anteriores cr\u00e9ditos pago puntualmente, en su permanencia en la instituci\u00f3n demostr\u00f3 responsabilidad, la se\u00f1ora se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de banderines y arreglos de nylon, para adornar las casas en especial para las fiestas de carnaval,  la se\u00f1ora trabaja junto a su esposo elaboran gran cantidad de adornos, la pareja actualmente no tiene hijos pero en un futuro quieren tener muchos hijos para darle un buen hogar, el trabajo de la se\u00f1ora es por temporadas ella tiene mas trabajo en fiestas y en estas ocasiones elabora en gran cantidad, la se\u00f1ora invertir\u00e1 el cr\u00e9dito en la compra de nylon por rollos\t para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus artesan\u00edas, la Sra.

La Sequita is a parish whose residents are honest people who know only work and dedication to family.\r\n\r\nIdalia, 53, lives here.  She\u2019s married and had ten children.  Nine of them are already adults and the youngest is a 16-year-old attending secondary school.  Six of her children are single and still living with them.   Her husband\u2019s a farmer.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband with help from their children grow all sorts of vegetables, corn and fruit like melons and watermelons.  They work Monday through Friday from 6:30am until 3pm in the fields.  Her husband also works three days a week selling fruit and vegetables that he buys from local farmers or at the wholesale market in Portoviejo.  He goes through Montecristi\u2019s streets on his three-wheeled cart with his products.

At the start of her life she was brought up in a home known as a garden where her mother worked for a flower company. Her hours of work were very long so she did not have time to spend with her children, Diana and her 2 older brothers. One day Diana met a man who she thought would be the man in her life and she had a little boy with him. It was a big disappointment for the family because she was the only girl and she still had not finished her high school education. Her mother decided to help her finish her certificate of secondary education and she was very proud to finish her studies, since the father of her child never accepted him. \r\n\r\nDiana decided to work in a flower company where she would get a bit more work experience and was taken on there as a temporary worker. After a year and a half she took exams to join the company. A month after this she met another boy who she liked very much and she became pregnant again. She had another little boy and this time the father accepted him and helps her to buy food for the children. He does not live with them, however, since he is a man with a lot of girlfriends. \r\n\r\nFeeling very disappointed by this situation, Diana decided to pick herself up and improve her situation in life by studying for a technical degree. What attracted her was Health Administration since every time she went for her check-ups she admired the administrative staff who dealt with her.

She and her husband try working at whatever they can find to make sure that their two children don't have to go without the things they need.  Since her marriage, Ana has worked on the farm in the afternoons, overseeing the workers and helping her husband.  She has two hectares of plantains that are being harvested and she's now thinking of jumping in to coffee growing though she says that coffee can only be harvested once a year.  The thing she most likes about being a farmer is the harvest because it's the time of year when she can go to market, sell her crop and buy the things she needs at home.  She hasn't liked having to remain behind at times because of a lack of transport, something that's very expensive.  The motive for her efforts is buying the basic goods that she needs at home.  Her greatest goal is to rebuild her wooden house with a better material.  Her idea is to plant coffee for the first time.  She says that this loan is a blessing for her, a way to fulfill her goal of being able to harvest and sell her coffee and, ultimately, help her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":215331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Plant a coffee crop for the first time.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-18T18:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-01T20:32:06Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957454},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227704},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422939},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116163},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011123},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":83.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:53:39Z","rounded_local_amount":88.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594726}],"funded_date":"2008-10-18T20:32:06Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:53:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":74423,"name":"Milica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Milica is 24 years old and lives in Kalenderovci, a village in Bosnia.

Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to add to her savings to purchase grocery goods.  \r\n\r\nHer husband, Mr. Ouk Sanh, is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate both rice and vegetables.  Mrs. Suor C. is 51 years old and the mother of four children, one of whom is a farmer while the others are attending the local school.\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans.  Five members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans.  These five members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.  End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor.  It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.  Most clients start to make their payments many months before the end of the loan term.

She lives with her three children in her own house.  Due to her life partner\u2019s abandonment, she is mother and father to her little ones.  Therefore, she works arduously in her coffee and banana fields.  Sometimes the money from the harvests does not suffice.  She looks for work with her neighbors, where they pay 13 PEN a day without including lunch.\r\n\r\nMiriam has the hope that when her children grow they will be able to help with her crops.  This way she will be able to plant in greater quantities.  Above all, she wants to plant coffee, which is a very profitable product.  That way she can avoid working for other people and work entirely on her crops.  Also, she would be able to get together more money for her children\u2019s education, which is her greatest desire as a mother.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP, where she has demonstrated punctuality in her payments.

Mohira is the 32-year-old loving mother of two children. Her husband is an electrician. For more than 7 years Mohira has sold fish in the central fish market of the city. When she started she made only a little money in turnover. With time her business expanded and today it is quite a stable business. Mohira requests a loan of $1500 USD. She wants to purchase a lot of fish at wholesale prices in order to have stock to sell in winter. Mohira has already been provided with three loans by IMON and has shown herself to be a reliable client. She would to thank everyone for their support.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 38 years old. Virginia is the group leader of a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nVirginia is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Virginia owns and operates a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing manicure and pedicure services in the local community. Virginia has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 2,300 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Virginia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virginia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide services. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Virginia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisher folk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":533134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

Her husband Elorde, 44 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 18 and 21 years old. Josephine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and her own efforts, Josephine has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,500, thus raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for her toddy and general store businesses so that she can continue to save up for her youngest son's future education and get a job.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She continues to push on with the help of her loans.

She is very dedicated to her work, which is the sale of sweets, snacks, stickers, etc.  She does this work on a tricycle, as does her husband, outside of schools from Monday to Friday.  \r\n\r\nShe leaves the house at 6:00 in the morning and works until 6 in the evening, when she returns home tired, since she drives her own tricycle while her husband has another and they split up.  \r\n\r\nOur partner was born in the Ecuadoran capital but since her marriage 10 years ago, she has lived in Portoviejo.  She has 4 children, but only one of them lives with her.  The rest live in Quito and are already on their own.  \r\n\r\nAside from tricycle sales, Julissa has another business; a food store which her son watches while she's out.  With this new loan, Julissa will be able to invest in her two businesses and advance them both. During the school year, confectionery sales are very successful and she needs to increase her stock, and the store also needs investment.  \r\n\r\nOur partner is very happy to be able to keep both her businesses stable.  Her dream is to have her own home and stop renting.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Nadine Riopel, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":542696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Candy, gum, potato chips, oil, rice, sugar, soda pop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Ercilia Julisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":193.76,"local_amount":192.51,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":193.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892520},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632866},{"amount":193.76,"local_amount":192.51,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":193.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846900},{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":129.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113361},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":64.17,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":64.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406921},{"amount":64.55,"local_amount":64.13,"processed_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":64.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406922}],"funded_date":"2010-06-17T02:28:59Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nadine Riopel","image":496782}},{"id":206389,"name":"Ney","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ney P., 47, is a villager who lives in Chambak Tuem village in Takeo province.

They feel in need to look for additional sources of income since the necessities of their children are always increasing.<p>\r\nThere are various businesses within the organization such as sales of food, dairy products, and cereals; the main activity, however, is the making of wool skirts (polleras) and other clothing for the local women (typical clothing used in the altiplano region).  They sell their clothing at the 16th of July fair, which only allows them to sell twice a week, for this reason they need a loan to rent store space where they can offer their clothing all the days of the week.  This will enable them to generate more income and continue to maintain the well being of their children.     \r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Laura Bobbit, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa asociaci\u00f3n denominada \u201cEl Ceibo \u201d trabaja junto a  Pro-Mujer hace ya varios a\u00f1os cumpliendo su d\u00e9cimo ciclo,  a la fecha  cuenta con 13 socias activas que han  demostrado ser un grupo organizado en cuanto a sus cuotas de cr\u00e9dito.\r\nDentro el grupo la mayor\u00eda son casadas y con un promedio de 6 hijos, se ven en la necesidad de buscar  otras fuentes de ingresos ya que las necesidades de sus hijos aumentan cada d\u00eda mas.<p>\r\nExisten diferentes negocios  dentro la asociaci\u00f3n como ser;

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For the past 15 years she has sold food items from a small store she set up in her home.  Additionally, she prepares food to order or, during coffee harvest time, when many day workers come to work the farms.  She spends most of her time in her store which is open every day.  From 6am on you can find her sweeping the perimeter of her house so that her store will look more attractive.

At the moment, Freddy is renting his home, but he has a small plot of land where he hopes to build a house and provide his family with a better quality of life.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe rest of the group is involved in various business activities.  Most either sell cosmetics or food as traveling vendors or from a permanent location.  In general, the group has enough experience to carry out their businesses.  Others have just recently started their businesses.  While competition continues to increase, the members know how to deal with it and obtain regular customers who appreciate their work and continue to demand their services.  In addition, it is important for the members to show enthusiasm for their work.  This loan will be used as operating capital to buy merchandise, acquire provisions, and repair work equipment.  Their greatest expectation is to have successful businesses in which their hard work and dedication result in an honest improvement in their income.  This will help them provide their families with a better quality of life.  This Communal Bank has limited experience with solidarity loans.  Even though they are just starting their first loan cycle, they have demonstrated in their meetings that they are enthusiastic and eager to succeed.     <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":498830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Operating capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-03-03T11:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margoth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuelita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aracelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":14500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1740.76},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1760.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1781.05},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1801.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1822.28},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1843.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1864.46},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1885.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.97},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.81},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.81},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1013.43,"local_amount":7081.78,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":7114.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945038},{"amount":524.63,"local_amount":3666.11,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3682.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673370},{"amount":0.26,"local_amount":1.79,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707393},{"amount":266.81,"local_amount":1864.46,"processed_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1873,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151890906},{"amount":269.87,"local_amount":1885.86,"processed_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1894.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151890907}],"funded_date":"2010-03-04T14:06:14Z","paid_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":185921,"name":"Albino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Albino tiene 38 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casado y tiene 3 hijos.

He lives in his own house with his wife who is 44 years old, Fermina, and three children. When Juan was young he worked in his father's fields, but 18 years ago he acquired a 3-hectare farm planted in cacao and coffee.  His success stems from his creativity and hard work, and he has benefitted from technical training as well.  Cacao is his most sought-after crop, for the high quality he produces, and generates strong profits.  Juan generally works alone, but in times of harvest he hires day laborers on the farm to gather ripe fruit.  He plans to use this credit to hire workers in the June to November harvest period, allowing him to expand production and better his family's prospects. This is his first credit, and with the 3,000 nuevos soles he will hire workers to clear the fields and bring in the harvest.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":822877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay farm workers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-26T11:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":203.42},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":210.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":221.48},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":226.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":237.15},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":243.2},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250.03},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":266.05},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":274.73},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":278.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":290.69},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":297.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.21},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.02},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.59,"local_amount":203.42,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":204.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350799},{"amount":77.28,"local_amount":210.78,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":211.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851159},{"amount":81.21,"local_amount":221.48,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:13Z","rounded_local_amount":222.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666335},{"amount":83.02,"local_amount":226.42,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":227.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621492},{"amount":86.96,"local_amount":237.15,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:36Z","rounded_local_amount":237.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835565},{"amount":89.17,"local_amount":243.2,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":243.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245325},{"amount":91.68,"local_amount":250.03,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":250.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385431},{"amount":97.55,"local_amount":266.05,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":266.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098554},{"amount":418.54,"local_amount":1141.47,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1145.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712758}],"funded_date":"2011-08-17T20:41:42Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matthew Cassetta","image":260079}},{"id":325244,"name":"Renacer Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 denominado Renacer es de la ciudad de Encarnaci\u00f3n, est\u00e1 integrado por amigas y vecinas de esa ciudad.

She joined One Acre Fund in order to educate them. In the recent 2011 season, Judith had a very good maize yield harvesting 10 bags on half an acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Judith was only able to harvest two bags of maize on that land. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Judith and her group during Kenya's next planting season in February 2012.
