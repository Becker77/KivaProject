She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and a pig-fattening businesses. Her husband Federico O., who is 58 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living, and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 19 to 31 years old. \r\n\r\nNelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 21,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 16th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to purchase a refrigerator for her sari-sari (general) store and also to add to her revolving working capital, so that she can continue to save up for future additional capital for both businesses. Nelita O. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF: <\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

C., 43, lives in the Salvadoran \"departamento\" of Usulutan.  Although she is married and has two children--16- and 14-years old, respectively--she lives only with her younger child because her husband and older child are in the United States.  Carmen has a tortilla business that she has operated for more than 2 years.  The business is reasonably profitable because tortillas are a basic ingredient of the Salvadoran diet and, consequently, much in demand.  Carmen is deliberate and hard-working.  Even thought she receives help from her husband, she wants a steady, stable income of her own so that she can better support herself and her daughter.

Violeta is 41-years old single and supports her family by operating two business ventures:  general store and personal collection businesses.  She lives in Toledo City, Cebu. Ma. Violeta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Violeta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,300, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to buy stocks for the general store so that she could continue to save up for the future improvement of her business. Ma. Violeta is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lucena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.

He has been running this business for ten years and has managed to give employment to one person. His motorcycle business is profitable and his major challenge is weather changes: during the rainy seasons, the roads become impassable and people prefer to use vans. However he works very hard to keep his business doing well. He is using his loan of Kes 80,000 to buy clothes and handbags to boost his clothing sales business.

Only two are below 15 years of age and some are in school. She lives in Bamenda, Northwest region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nHer major challenges in life have been the difficulty of her children dropping out of school and  some being locked up in a police cell and inadequate capital to start up a business for herself before joining GHAPE. She has also suffered greatly from ill health. Given a loan she plans to buy Irish potatoes, cocoyams, yellow yams and local plums. She knows her business is going to succeed because she has acquired some basic training on finance management and marketing techniques from GHAPE and she has chosen to diversify business by also investing some of her capital in her farm and also, she has got support and hence success. The loan if granted will enable her to sell in her neighborhood at cheaper prices. She joined GHAPE in 2008, since then she has successfully borrowed and repaid loans two times.\r\n\r\nShe will plough back some of her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her house rent. Her children\u2019s school needs will be taken care of. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Catherine has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and has applied for a new loan to buy additional stocks of rice and maize in bulk. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

San Andr\u00e9s is situated in the Atitl\u00e1n region. The people of this beautiful place are fortunate enough to wake up every day and admire the beauty of Atitl\u00e1n Lake. San Andr\u00e9s is also known for being a traditional town that conserves its values, but is also developing. \r\n<p> The members of Trixana are a group of women who are learning to manage credit. This is the second loan that they have requested. They are asking for this loan for many reasons. First, this is the first time that they have access to a loan so easily; for them to qualify, it is enough that they are a group of women, that they agree to stick together to repay the loan, and that they have a photocopy of a government-issued identity document. Second, they are requesting another loan because they benefitted from the first one. They said that thanks to the previous loan, they were able to buy more raw materials, which permitted them to make more profits.\r\n<p> Apparently in the micro-finances, especially with new clients, being able to buy a more merchandise and generating more profits is something that rarely happens. Because of this, their success is remarkable. \r\n<p> The members of Trixana work in different industries. Most of the women work in the textiles industry; they knit traditional blouses called \u201chuililes.\u201d Also, two women have a tortilla shop. This business has profits because tortillas have an inelastic demand in rural Guatemala. There are also women that work in a variety of businesses, such as cultivating flowers and corn, selling beans and rice, and looking after a store. A plot of land, that 8 years ago cost Q250.00 to rent, now costs Q800.00, according to Alicia C..\r\n<p> Am\u00e9rica C. said that she likes working with The Friendship Bridge because of the training that she receives, especially that of her rights as a woman. Now, thanks to this training, she knows her rights as a woman. We feel very satisfied with this. Your support will contribute enormously with the development of this Guatemalan town.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by A. Shah, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres que conforman el grupo Trixana en su mayor\u00eda provienen de un bello pueblo llamado San Andr\u00e9s Semetabaj. San Andres queda en la regi\u00f3n de Atitl\u00e1n. Los pobladores de este bello lugar tienen la fortuna de levantarse todos los d\u00edas y admirar la belleza del lago Atitl\u00e1n. San Andr\u00e9s tambi\u00e9n es conocido por ser un pueblo tradicional que conserva sus valores pero que tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 desarrollando.       \r\n\r\n<P>Las Trixanas son un grupo de mujeres que est\u00e1 aprendiendo a manejar el cr\u00e9dito. Este cr\u00e9dito que van a solicitar es el segundo en su vida. Ellas est\u00e1n solicitando este cr\u00e9dito por muchas razones: primero, es la primera vez que tienen acceso a un pr\u00e9stamo tan f\u00e1cil, solo basta un grupo de mujeres, una garant\u00eda solidaria y una fotocopia del documento nacional de identidad. Segundo, porque les fue bien en su cr\u00e9dito anterior. Ellas comentaron que gracias al pr\u00e9stamo anterior fueron capaces de comprar una mayor cantidad de materia prima lo cual les permiti\u00f3 generar m\u00e1s ganancias. \r\n\r\n<P>Al parecer en las micro finanzas, especialmente con clientes nuevas, lograr poder comprar un poco m\u00e1s de mercader\u00eda y generar un poco m\u00e1s de ganancias es un evento que las clientes nunca esperaron lograr. Es por eso, en parte, porque las microfinanzas es un \u00e9xito alrededor del mundo.\r\n\r\n<P>Las Trixanas trabajan en distintas industrias. En su mayor\u00eda las mujeres trabajan en el \u00e1rea textil, ellas tejen blusas tradicionales llamadas huipiles. Luego, dos mujeres tienen una tortiller\u00eda. Este negocio no tiene pierde, ya que las tortillas tiene una demanda inel\u00e1stica en el \u00e1rea rural de Guatemala. Luego, hay mujeres que trabajan en una variedad de negocios como el cultivo de flores, ma\u00edz, venta de frijol y ma\u00edz y atienden una tienda. Hace ocho a\u00f1os alquilar cinco cuerdas de tierra (25m x 25m) costaba Q250.00 el d\u00eda de hoy alquilar la misma cantidad de tierras cuesta Q800.00 seg\u00fan comentaba Alicia C.. \r\n\r\n<P>Am\u00e9rica C. coment\u00f3 que le gustaba trabajar con The Friendship Bridge por las capacitaciones que recib\u00eda, especialmente la de los derechos de la mujer. Ahora, gracias a estas capacitaciones, ella est\u00e1 segura de sus derechos como mujer. Nosotros como instituci\u00f3n nos sentimos muy satisfechos con esto y usted gracias a su apoyo van a contribuir enormemente con el desarrollo del pueblo Guatemalteco."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":185968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

She is separated and lives in her own home with her eldest son called Jos\u00e9 (she has 6 children in all).  She also lives with her 13 year-old grandson Jeremy who is her treasure.  This enterprising mother, through a lot of hard work, set up a small grocery store and made it prosper.  She also bought a car, a tool with which she has managed to get her children ahead in life.  Her children are now good, hard-working people.  However, Jes\u00fas was sick for a long time and, as a result, her store gradually failed.  She only had her car left and her son used it.\n\nFor approximately 7 years, Jes\u00fas has been managing the profits that she receives from offering a transport service.  She recently managed to renew her car.  She is convinced that if she continues to work and look after her health, in the future she will be able to re-open her store which she likes so much and she wishes for this \"in spite of the fact that it is very enslaving\".\n\nAt the moment, Jes\u00fas' main priority is to have her car serviced so that her son can continue to work without difficulty. She has set an example as the leader of her community bank during this time.  Her fellow members like her a lot for the support she has provided.\n\nJes\u00fas will use the loan she is requesting to have her car serviced so that her son can continue working and making good profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":729104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to have her car serviced","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-14T22:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":293.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":312.64},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":324.59},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":341.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":355.57},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":372.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.73},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.89},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":106.33,"local_amount":293.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":294.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196348},{"amount":113.33,"local_amount":312.64,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":313.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270026},{"amount":117.67,"local_amount":324.59,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":325.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550042},{"amount":157.7,"local_amount":435.03,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":436.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718722},{"amount":134.3,"local_amount":370.48,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":371.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350160},{"amount":95.67,"local_amount":263.93,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":264.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850669}],"funded_date":"2011-03-17T06:37:13Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":284682,"name":"Lindi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanaid A., who is married with three children, has been a food vendor for 9 years.

Together they have been able to succeed on behalf of their children and provide them an education.  At the moment, only one child lives with them in their home in the village of Patay.  Through effort and dedication, Yolanda and her husband formed a family that gives them great pride.  Farming has been her main business activity for the past 20 years and has made it possible for her to pay for her children\u2019s higher education.  Her children visit her frequently and she is happy to have the love of her grandchildren who she spoils.  Yolanda\u2019s main crops are gladiola flowers, peas, and potatoes.  She provides her crops frequent care and fertilization because she knows this attention will result in good sales at the end of each harvest.  Yolanda sells her crops at the wholesale market in Tarma.  Depending on the quality of her crops, she will even take them to Lima where she can get a better price.  She planted gladiolas and peas early and they will soon be ready to harvest.  \r\n<p>\r\nYolanda is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cPicaflores de Patay\u201d and is receiving her fifth loan from MFP.

He always had to stay in very cold rooms and he was sick almost once a month. While he recovered, he was thinking about how he could provide for his family and a friend invited him to a fishing practice. He did not have any resources to practice this sport, so he started to manufacture his own nets. First he learned to fish and when he saw that his work was excellent and much stronger, his friends began to become interested and they wanted to buy from him. Through this, he found that he could do it as a business. At this moment he has 8 years of experience in this business and he sells his products to both friends, and also any sports stores that are interested in buying from him. Marcelo is requesting a loan of US$ 275 because the shrimp season is coming up and he needs to be prepared with enough merchandise.<P>\r\n\r\n** This text has been translated from the following original business description. <p> \r\n\r\nMarcelo mucho tiempo trabajo en el \u00e1rea de carnicer\u00eda, tuvo que retirarse de esta actividad pues su salud se vio afectada por el contacto directo de los cuartos fr\u00edos, se enfermaba constantemente.

which has a favorable climate and where the cultivation of these crops is an established tradition. He works the fields with the support of his wife, who is also dedicated to the production. This couple has been perfecting and modernizing their production processes. The maintenance of the land has a high cost, due to the attention that must be given to the plants in each phase of the process, such as manually weeding and using organic fertilizer and natural supplements for the control of diseases. These give better yields to their crops, since they prevent the soil from deteriorating so much, provide better conditions for cultivation at planting time and improve the quality of the crop, increasing its value. Organic products currently obtain better prices in the market. Dilovar requests a loan for the purchase of supplies for his crops, such as seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. He will use part of the loan to pay wages to the hired workers. The loan will greatly improve Dilovar\u2019s income and his family's living conditions.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tajikistan. Her hope was to improve the standard of living for her family and to provide education to her two children. Over the past decade, Husniobod has successfully developed her own clothing business with the support of microfinance loans through IMON International. A committed and hardworking businesswoman, Husniobod has successfully repaid each loan. With the profits from her business, Husniobod has supported not only the education of her daughters, but also her aging parents. Currently, Husniobod is seeking a loan of 8000 Somoni to expand her inventory and increase the variety of products for sale. With the additional profits, Husniobod plans to continue expanding her business and supporting her family. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Jair prepared and sold simple products, but through hard work and discipline, his business grew rapidly.  For this reason, he had to move to a large location in a recognized area.  He had great expectations, so he acquired an oven and a larger hot dog cart so that he could become established and now he is well-known.  What stands out most about Jair is the great support he has received from his family and he expects it will remain that way.  He works with his brother and his goal is to continue supporting his parents and one day start his own family.  \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will invest the proceeds in supplies and fixed assets such as a chicken roaster, a hot dog cart with a canopy, and a chicken warming compartment.

Fid\u00e8le was born in Gatsibo, the former province of Kibuye, which is now the district of Karongi, a western province. He is 35 years old, married with two children who are 5\u00bd and 3\u00bd years old. He began as a butcher, but later became a motorcycle taxi driver, which he has been doing for 3 years.  Because he is thrifty and was able to save money, he became owner of the motorcycle which he had borrowed.  He has been a client of ACB since June of 2008, and has already repaid a loan.  He has requested this loan to pay the tuition of his wife, who is in her second year at university. In the future, he plans to sit for the test to obtain a Category D drivers license for a minibus taxi, then borrow enough to purchase a minibus which he would operate himself.  Long term, this would enable him to increase his income and become financially independent.  Theconditions of his life would be improved, and he would realize his dreams.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Linda Koza, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":560495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"Pay tuition for his wife","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Nyarugenge","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":170,"posted_date":"2010-06-26T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fid\u00e9le","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":66667},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":66667},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":66666}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":83334,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":84729.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159577533},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:27:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50837.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166788087},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":66666,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":67782.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172057557}],"funded_date":"2010-06-26T09:43:31Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:31:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Koza","image":249316}},{"id":215035,"name":"Virgie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virgie D.

Su meta es tener un gabinete de belleza. \n\n","en":"Martha C. is a member of El Aguacate (Avocado) community bank and lives in the community of the same name in the city of Cuenca. This city has a beautiful culture and tradition and is known for its great variety of gastronomy as well as having four rivers running through it. Martha works alongside her husband at their jewelry shop, an activity they have been doing for a number of years. She also makes a living selling pigs, a business she learned from her parents in which she now has a lot of experience. She enjoys the job because it earns income quickly, but the problem is it takes a lot of capital to buy the pigs at the start. Martha is 33 years old and her husband is 37. They have two children, ages 8 and 2. They don't own a home but live in a family member's home independently. Martha has been a member of her community bank for a year and four months and enjoys the loans since they are quick and don't have a lot of red tape. She plans on using half of the loan for her jewelry business and the other half to buy pigs. Her goal is to have a beauty shop.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":650376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase jewelry and pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Braulia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":180,"local_amount":176,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188683357},{"amount":180,"local_amount":176,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422481},{"amount":180,"local_amount":176,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195841250},{"amount":180,"local_amount":176,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283634},{"amount":180,"local_amount":176,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206151585}],"funded_date":"2010-12-18T10:42:54Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":256015,"name":"Virginia Ester","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Virginia, resiD. en Usulut\u00e1n, vive con sus hijos y su esposo, tiene 45 a\u00f1os D. edad, se dedica a la venta D. tablilla, tamales y meriendas, este negocio lo inicio hace 8 a\u00f1os con la ayuda D. sus hijos, pero por el momento quiere invertir y no cuenta con ahorros para poder realizar las compras necesarias D. materiales para la preparaci\u00f3n D. sus productos.\nElla solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra D. ma\u00edz, condimentos, cacao y az\u00facar, as\u00ed como productos para prepara las meriendas, este pr\u00e9stamo le ayudara a realizar la compra y a fortalecer el negocio para producir m\u00e1s e incrementar las ventas.\nTiene como prop\u00f3sito administrar bien los fondos del pr\u00e9stamo haciendo una buena inversi\u00f3n, pagar puntualmente y seguir creciendo en busca D. un mejor futuro.\n","en":"Do\u00f1a Virginia lives in Usulut\u00e1n with her children and husband.

She has a sales post in Puc\u00f3n, which her daughters, ages 19 and 12, tend to. Her husband also helps when he has free days from his work as a public transportation driver. Ximena's dream is to have a sales post in Talcahuano and in this way become more independent. Her motivation to continue with the business is to finance her daughter's higher education since she is studying at an institute. Kiva partner Fondo Esperanza has provided Ximena and her business a lot of support, and she has been touched by her good treatment, the friendship and the responsibility.

The first loan he took out was a consumer loan to buy a television set and stand for his home.  Having successfully repaid it without problem, he decided to once again obtain a loan.  He plans to spend his next loan on the purchase of small livestock, sheep and goats.  He explained he wants to increase the size of his flock to fatten next season for sale.  Sulton really loves caring for sheep.  At present he has six in his flock.

S\u00e1nchez, 34, is a single mother of a 5-year-old son, who is in the first grade. She hopes to make her business business grow to support her family and  to live a long life to care for her child, and raise him to be a productive man. Damaris would love to open a small grocery store in her home, to be able to care for her son while tending her business. There is no other store in the area, so opening one would be a good business move.

Ravshan grows wheat and vegetables. He is 46 years old and has four children. Before he worked as a driver. He was not happy with his previous job because he received little compensation for his work. So he went back to his village and decided to manage his small farm. In the year 2000, he started managing his farm. He uses his harvest to buy the things his family needs and to help send his children to school. Ravshan is asking for a loan of 3500 Somoni.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History:<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a married woman, who is 23 years old and has no children.\r\n\r\nMiriama owns and operates a business venture, planting and harvesting taro for sale.  She has many years of experience in this business.  Miriama needs a loan of WST 1000 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Miriama joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Miriama's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

She is a widow and has 1 child aged 24 years. She has 2 additional dependents. In 1980, Isatu established her essential drugs (tablets, syrups, pain killers) business. She began her business because she dropped out of school when she became pregnant by her late husband. Her parents asked her to marry him as they thought it was the best decision.  Since her dreams of going to medical school were shattered, she was given some amount of money after given birth, which she used to start selling medication. Working 7 days a week and 14 hours a day, she earns about Le 3,585,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000. Isatu has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy the following medication: Panadol - 1 carton @ Le440,000, ORS - 1 carton @ Le340,000, hot rubs - 4 bundles @ Le150,000, cold rubs - 2 cartons @ Le150,000, dexoranges - 4 carton @ Le220,000 and haemporte - 2 carton @ Le220,000. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 538,000. In the future, Isatu plans to complete her unfinished building. She felt good as this loan is helping her to improve her business.  She is nervous about the future. She hopes for her adopted children to have a good education.  The loan will serve as another source of income.  \r\n\r\nChanges in government policies such as increases in taxes are her problem, but in terms of competition, it is moderate as she only has one competitor in that area.  She serves patients from the nearby hospital and retailers, about 50 people per day.  Her business is popular because she has good customer care and offers a legal business.

Therefore, Wilmer has been selling meat from a table and a stand that he made himself. He is need of a loan so that he may begin to buy different kinds of meats including poultry and fish. He wants to increase his revenue so he can save money for a new store. His goal is to increase his profits and buy a new refrigerator for leftover meats. For the time being he can only buy amounts he knows he will sell because he does not have sufficient storage for leftovers.

So as to get a footing in economic life, she started several businesses, without success. In the end, she settled for the food-serving business eight years ago. She makes and serves snacks (beignets) and simple dishes (beans, spaghetti, etc). Well known and much appreciated thanks to the quality of her cooking, she has a clientele that is expanding every day. Anxious to maintain her ever-increasing clientele, she decided to join the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso three years ago. She's now seeking her second personal loan after four group loans (solidarity loans) that were repaid without problems.\r\nShe purchases raw materials from wholesale sellers in the grand market in Koutiala and does her cooking in front of her door in the Hamdallaye neighborhood. Beignets, beans and spaghetti are thus prepared and sold in front of the family house. Her clientele comes from all social categories in the city. Her business is open daily and all year long. She usually sells for cash and sometimes on credit. She foresees that she will make a monthly profit of XOF 60'000 (ca US$ 120), to be used to repay the loan and help with the daily family expenses. In the future, her ambition is to open a restaurant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva

This is 34-year-old Perusi S. from Mwanza.  She is married with three children, between the ages of 11 and 14 years old. Perusi has been running a poultry business since 2002. <P>\r\n\r\nRaising \"kuku\" is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. <P>\r\n\r\nPerusi works at the business for 8 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Perusi currently earns about 200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase more kuku (chickens). In the future, she plans to expand her business. Perusi thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\n<B>ABOUT SELFINA<\/b><P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":317992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She invested her very first loan of 300 soles (about $100) in purchasing fish for sale.

Nelson has been working as a doorman at a school for the past 15 years, and Juanita has been working as a nanny for the past 36 years.\n\nThe loan is to be able to make their businesses a little bigger by increasing their merchandise and raw materials to improve their income.  This way they will be able to get their children and their families ahead.

She lives in her own home with her husband and 3 grown children. She sells sandwiches in the afternoon. She is an expert in frying picarones (sweets maD. from flour, sweet potato, pumpkin and yeast). Every day she works to sell all of her picarones, and so her profits are good. Years ago she sold them out of her house, which was not very profitable, so she now sells her food at a bus station and serves people waiting for buses and just arriving. This is very profitable and she is making a good income. She is happy with her work, because it also gives her time to sell beauty products.

He is 35 years old and lives very happily in his own house with his wife Enafilia, who is 34, and their two small children, who are his motivation to work hard everyday.\r\n\r\nWith his wife, he grows coconuts, bananas, coffee, corn, cassava and citrus fruits on fertile land that he owns.  When Digmar and Enafilia decided to make a life together, they chose these crops because they valued the teaching his parents gave him, and also because these crops are the ones that grow best in this zone of Peru's Central Jungle.  Every morning, according to his routine, Digmar goes out to weed and take care of his crops because he knows the payment for his hard work will come in the harvest.  He confesses that it fascinates him to see his plants grow strong, without any disease that interrupts their growth.  His greatest desire is for his children to be able to study a professional career in the city and not depend on agricultural work, despite its being very profitable.  For the moment he wants to increase the number of coffee fields and orange fields that he has.\r\n\r\nThis is Digmar's second loan with MFP, and as president of the board of directors of his group, he is the one to makes his communal bank follow its rules.  For this reason everything has gone very well until now.  With the loan he is requesting, Digmar will buy various work tools like machetes and crates.  He will also hire workers to clear the fields he has just bought.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":552352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy machetes and crates, and hire workers to clear his fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-14T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Digmar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":255.46,"local_amount":704.71,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":727.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326803},{"amount":469.54,"local_amount":1295.29,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1336.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270309}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T18:03:05Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":210969,"name":"Jealyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jealyn S. is from the village of Pagalongan, Wao, Lanao del Sur.

She owns and operates a business venture, selling both food and daily use products in the local community.  She has two years of experience in this business. Carolin needs a loan of $1500 Samoan Talas (WST) to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or $167 US per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Carolin joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Carolin's second loan with SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: In 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

SPBD.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":928301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Aminata D. is 47 years old and lives with her eight children and her husband in a monogamous family in the Pelengana quarter, south of the city of S\u00e9gou (fourth largest economic region in Mali). In the beginning she used to send her servants out to search for firewood for her own personal use, but when her neighbors saw the bundles of wood, they would always come and ask her to sell them some of it. Therefore, she decided to get involved in the firewood business and has been involved in it for 13 years. She makes all her sales at home, for cash or credit to her customers, who are mainly comprised of women as well as bakers. She sells firewood year-round. After having taken out five group loans, she is on her second individual loan and all previous loans were correctly repaid. With this loan she hopes to buy 20 loads of firewood from the surrounding villages of S\u00e9gou from farmers who are legally established in the firewood business, and she hopes to make a monthly profit of 12,000 FCFA (about $29), which she hopes to reinvest into her business.\r\n<b><p>Translated from French by Manuel Carreiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nMadame Aminata D. est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 47ans et vit avec ses 8 enfants et son mari dans une famille monogame dans le quartier Pelengana sud de la ville de S\u00e9gou (quatri\u00e8me r\u00e9gion \u00e9conomique de la r\u00e9publique du Mali). \r\nAu d\u00e9but elle envoyait ses domestiques chercher du bois de chauffe pour usage personnel, ses voisins voyant les tas de fagots, venaient toujours lui demander de leur en vendre une partie.

S. is 28 and lives with her parents and three-year-old son in Uvurhanghay, one of Mongolia's southern provinces. Her parents receive a government pension, but her mother has been ill lately. Although Tserenbyamba has her own one-bedroom apartment in town, she has rented it out to pay for medicine for her sick mother. \r\n\r\nAfter she graduated from university in 2001, Tserenbyamba started a small retail business selling women and men's clothing. Early that year, she opened a small stall in the local market, and in December 2008, she rented another stall in a new shopping center that just opened. She usually buys clothing from the wholesale markets in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. She hopes she can afford all the medicine her mother needs, and would eventually like to open her own clothing shop. Tserenbyamba is applying for this loan to buy more clothing from Ulaanbaatar to sell to her customers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":318013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es la libertad que tiene para encargarse de su negocio y ser su propio jefe. Lleva 5 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de su trabajo es tener que permanecer todo el d\u00eda bajo el inclemente sol, ya que esto lo cansa mucho. Para un futuro cercano, Carlos espera tener una tienda donde pueda vender bicicletas nuevas, ya que actualmente se dedica a vender las bicicletas que arregla. Este es su quinto pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y espera tener la misma puntualidad que tuvo en sus dos primeros cr\u00e9ditos. En su banco comunal es un socio muy responsable y solidario. Con los seiscientos nuevos soles solicitados planea comprar m\u00e1s bicicletas para arreglarlas y as\u00ed incrementar la cantidad que vende.","en":"Carlos is an easy-going and responsible person. His is forty-five years old and lives in a house that he inherited from his parents. He lives with is wife Carmen, 45 years old, to whom he desires to provide a better life. With a lot of drive to succeed, Carlos begins his days at his business selling bicycles at the \u201cEsplanada Laguna\u201d. It is a temporary location in the city of Juliaca where they have fairs. He is a very able salesperson. He always convinces his customers to buy bicycles. What he likes the best about his business is the freedom to be own boss. He has been in business for five years. He finds that the most difficult part of his business is to remain all day in the sun as it tires you out a lot. In the near future, Carlos hopes to have a store where he can sell new bicycles or bicycles that he fixes up. This is his fifth loan with MFP and he hopes to have the same punctuality that he had with the first two loans. He is a responsible and joint member of the communal bank. With the 600 soles he has requested, he will buy more bicycles to fix up and increase the number that he sells. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esther Levandoski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":347147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bicycle Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase his inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-04T15:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":101.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211962},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":101.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641490},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":101.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080929},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:58:43Z","rounded_local_amount":101.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997071},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":101.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842413},{"amount":33.35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":101.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842414}],"funded_date":"2009-07-04T19:48:36Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Esther Levandoski","image":11830}},{"id":124091,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is 53 years old.

They call their group Salapateh. They are local entrepreneurs in Waterloo small-town, about 22 miles from Freetown. This is the first loan this group of entrepreneurs is accessing from SMT, a partner of Shine on Sierra Leone. With the help of a loan of LE 500,000 for each entrepreneur, they will be able to expand their businesses, make better profits and consequently improve the status and quality of their businesses.\r\n\r\nIsatu K. (right and attached below left) is the leader of the group. She is 23 years old. She was born in a village called Masinra, in northern Sierra Leone. Isatu is a widow with one child who is four years old. Isatu sells palm-oil (the most popular cooking oil), bananas, plantains, cucumbers, pineapples, and any other items she discovers to be in high demand in the market. With this loan, Isatu will buy gallons of palm-oil. Five gallons make a \u201cbarter\u201d and a barter of palm-oil costs her LE 60,000, which she sells at LE 65,000 - 70,000.

The family survived for years on her husband\u2019s work as a plumber and Tonya\u2019s career as a corporate executive assistant.\r\n\r\nAfter suffering through a severe illness for a few years, Tonya was laid off from her job in 2008. Throughout Tonya\u2019s illness and recovery, Ted was by her side to take care of her. He cut back his hours working as a plumber and eventually the family filed for bankruptcy as medical bills stacked up. \u201cWhen all was said and done, we\u2019d lost our home, lost everything and had to start over.\u201d \r\n\r\nTonya is now healthy and grateful for a new chance at life. She works side-by-side with her husband at Plumbwerx Plumbing, their family-run business. It\u2019s a full service plumbing company specializing in all phases of residential and commercial plumbing, with one of their niches being tankless water heaters, an eco-friendly product that saves consumers money, energy and provides continuous hot water!\r\n\r\n\u201cMost people aren\u2019t expecting to see a woman running a plumbing business when they come into the office,\u201d said Tonya. But it\u2019s clear she runs a tight ship and she puts her background as a corporate executive assistant to good use, deftly managing the accounting, marketing, sales, inventory, and dispatching her husband and team on jobs.\r\n\r\n\u201cI get calls everyday from referral partners who want us to provide all types of plumbing services but I have to turn them down because we don\u2019t have the manpower to meet demand,\u201d said Tonya.

It provided her with an opportunity of accessing start-up capital for income-generating activities. With her first loan from ASHI, she carefully invested in her sari-sari store (a small retail store selling different goods). She uses the profits for daily expenses.\r\n<br>Now on her third loan, Josefina is requesting 15,000 PHP to create a broader business. Specifically, the amount will be used to purchase additional supplies for her sari-sari store, such as cases of beers, soft drinks, and other stocks. She is very determined and disciplined in her use of the loan.\r\n<br>Josefina still dreams of the best for her family: to provide the best education for her grandchildren and to have a happy family. During the course of her membership in ASHI, she has shown herself to be industrious and determined to make her dreams come true.\r\n<br>Josefina is a 54-year-old business-minded woman. Her husband passed away so she is now the single mother of her daughter, Janett. She lives in Pililia, in the province of Rizal, Philippines.

Since the microcredit ASHI is extending to these women is delivered directly in their villages on the doorsteps of their houses, they are given the hope that someday they will \u201crise above

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is 44 years old. Estilita is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nEstilita is married and has 3 adult-aged children. To make a living, Estilita owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Estilita has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Estilita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Estilita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Estilita is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Estilita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
