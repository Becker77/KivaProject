She lives in the Bella Vista neighborhood of the city of Catacamos, Olancho.  Andrea has been making food such as corn tortillas, nacatamales (a type of large tamale typical of Central America), sweets, and other dishes for 15 years.  She started out selling corn tortillas to support her 4 children.  Now, Andrea and 2 of her children and a daughter-in-law get up early every day at 3am, since they have a deal where they must deliver tortillas at 8am.  In addition, she sells nacatamales made of chicken and meat, small bean tamales, and on Sundays she makes beef tacos.  Her advantage is that she can work out of her own house.  One difficulty she faces is that she doesn't have enough money to make a greater quantity of products.

He is married and lives in his own home.  Jos\u00e9's wife is a housewife and also raises animals such as lambs, pigs and chickens to make a little bit of extra money.  There are 6 people in Jos\u00e9's family: himself, his wife and four children (2 sons and 2 daughters).  None of his children are dependent on him any longer, however, as they are all married and have their own children.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is in the building trade but this does not provide daily work so he also works selling household products.  Every weekend, Jos\u00e9 goes out to sell his products in the town market, the busiest market day being Sunday.  On Sundays he goes out very early in the morning, sets up his stall and sells yarn, thread, needles, scouring pads, cotton buds and personal hygiene products such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, sponges, etc.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 already has 40 years of experience in this business.  His does not find his business difficult and is used to the work.  He knows what it means to be a salesman and doesn't worry too much.  He comments that there are good days and bad days in every business but every business is blessed and grumbling doesn't make things go any better.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 re-invests the profits that he makes in his business, buying new products.  One of his children helps him choose what to buy.  He chooses new products that he sees will sell easily.  He also gives some money to his wife but not a lot since his wife also makes income from her animals.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 and his wife support each other in covering their expenses and each of them manages to get ahead in their business.  They are slowly building up savings so that they have money available in case of emergency or in case one of them should fall ill."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":665082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy merchandise (thread, yarn, needles, scourers and cotton buds).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-24T21:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Eusebio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1016.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1100.08},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1127.23},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1192.29},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1248.12},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1315.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.16},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.3},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.62},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.19},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.98},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.16,"local_amount":1016.91,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1051.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850114},{"amount":94.3,"local_amount":1100.08,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1137.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292388},{"amount":96.62,"local_amount":1127.23,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1165.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160646},{"amount":102.19,"local_amount":1192.29,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1233.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233524},{"amount":106.98,"local_amount":1248.12,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1291,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512384},{"amount":112.75,"local_amount":1315.37,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223082}],"funded_date":"2011-01-24T22:54:34Z","paid_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":272063,"name":"Maria Elsa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Maria Elsa vive con una de sus hijas y un nietecito,  labora para el Minsa desde hace 33 a\u00f1os con gran dedicaci\u00f2n  y esmero, es una mujer emprendedora, que lucha por sacar adelante a su familia y darle lo mejor, es bien responsable con sus compromisos adquiridos, cuenta con la ayuda de sus hijos mayores los cuales son independiente y muy trabajadores.  \n\nSolicita su 9no credito a la instituci\u00f2n con el apoyo de Kiva que desde ya agradece mucho, requiere este financiamiento para cambiarle el zinc a su vivienda, \n\nSu mayor sue\u00f1o en la vida es gozar de mucha salud y que su familia sigan las cosas de Dios y cuenten con un trabajo digno.","en":"Mar\u00eda Elsa lives with one of her daughters and a little grandson.

Reina\u2019s grocery shop is one of the busiest in the town of Quimbiri. Her great charisma and the kindness in her customer service have made her the favorite among her neighbors, who do not hesitate to make their purchases starting very early, since they know that hers is the first store to open and the last one to close.\r\nWhat she likes the most about her job is giving advice to her customers about the quality and variety of every product. She has been in this business for 10 years, and what she considers the most difficult is having to stay in her store all day waiting for customers, since this is what her income is dependent on \u2013 thanks to the sale of her merchandise. Reina bought a variety of goods for her home and, for the good of her business, she is requesting the loan to be able to buy the necessary provisions for her sales point. This will be Reina\u2019s third loan and she is very happy to know that she will once again have your support to continue prospering. She is an active member in her communal bank.

She says her main difficulty is having to buy the flour, oils, and seeds she uses for bread making. However, she states that  she now needs a more modern oven to bake her bread. She's presently using an oven fueled by wood.

In this way she earns 10500 KGS per month. That profit made it possible for her to save money and purchase her own space. \r\n\r\nJyldyz applied for the loan because she needs money to purchase jeans, sportswear and other clothes in order to increase the turnover of her products. In the future she wants to expand her business and build a big house for her family.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

Alfredo had limited opportunities to attend school, because during colonial rule the indigenous population was not allowed to attend school above 4th grade level. \r\n\r\nSince 1987, Alfredo has been working in agriculture. He owns a 12 hectare plot in the district of Boane.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, he heard about HLUVUKU-ADSEMA through friends. Alfredo learned more about the conditions for access to loans, and decided to request a loan in order to expand his farming area.\r\n\r\nWith the 25.000,00 MT loan, he intends to expand his maize farming area from 3 hectares to 6 hectares, to purchase seeds and fertilizers, and to clear and prepare plots, consequently increasing his production.\r\n\r\nAlfredo currently employs 3 full-time workers. With the increase of his farming area he plans on hiring 3 more permanent workers, in addition to hiring temporary workers which will be needed when the work load so requires. \r\n\r\nAlfredo\u2019s activities have a great impact in his community because he generates work for 6 community members, and income for their families.

They are neighbours as well as friends.  Martha del Socorro M. M. is 42 years old, married and has a teenaged son who is in school and whom she supports.  She prepares nacatamales and sells them from her home.  She is known throughout her neighbourhood as she has had this business for the past nine years.  Her mother, who has since passed away, taught her to prepare nacatamales.  She also sells pork.\r\n\r\nHer husband, who sells clothing, helps her with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy pigs for slaughter and so earn more money and be able to sell the derivatives such as cracklings, fried pork and fresh pork meat.\r\n\r\nShe believes that if she maintains a good credit profile with punctual payments she will be able to expand her business.<br

Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":140180,"name":"Mercedez","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercedez O. is shown in the picture posing with the motorcycle she intends to convert into a tricycle because, with the additional sidecar, it can shuttle more passengers in one trip than just a two-wheeled vehicle. Mercedez lives in the village of Brgy. Canggapas Anahaw, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She is 44 years of age and married to Romeo, who presently works as a security guard. The couple is blessed with two children: her elder, a 21-year-old daughter, now works abroad and sends money home to help the family. The younger, who is 14 years old, is in high school. Mercedez knew that she could never provide her children with a better future if the family just relied on the small salary that her husband earns as a security guard; it was not even enough to properly feed the family. So she drew on her own talents and, with complete faith that God loves her and her family and would bless her endeavors, she took the plunge and became a micro entrepreneur.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen she started, Mercedez wasn't very ambitious. Her plan was just to open a business that could supplement, even in just a small way, her husband's income and probably improve their quality of life somehow. She joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 to borrow 3,000 pesos start-up capital for an electronic reloading business, selling E-load* to prepaid subscribers of mobile phone service companies.\r\n<p>\r\nAs her income improved, she opened a refreshment shop serving local <i>merienda<\/i> (snack time) fare like <i>batchoy<\/i> (a pork and noodle soup popular in the Western Visayas region), <i>pancit molo<\/i> (wanton-wrapped pork dumplings cooked in chicken broth) and other snack fare. The new venture is symbiotically compatible with her eload business as customers in one business tend to patronize the other just because they are already in her shop. The food patrons who need load for their mobile phones buy it from her instead of going to another retailer, while load buyers stay to eat her snacks. The new venture has increased her income exponentially and it has also made Mercedes realize that she actually has good business instincts. Her later loans allowed Mercedes to improve and expand her businesses, and even to buy a motorcycle, which provides her with additional income as it shuttles passengers around the town. The businesses earn a net income of 3,000 pesos per month, which helps her pay for the education of her son and also cover some of the family's daily expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nMercedez borrowed 12,000 pesos with her previous loan, and she was able to pay it back in weekly installments without any delays. She is borrowing 15,000 pesos now on her seventh loan cycle. She plans to use the money to buy a sidecar for the motorcycle to increase its income potential, and she also intends to use any money left over for the other business ventures.\r\n<p>\r\n*Eload - is a service that allows prepaid mobile phone subscribers to buy load from retailers so that they can continue using the mobile phone service when they have consumed the service credits on their cellular phones. Demand for this kind of service is high because cell phones are a must-have for most Filipinos, but the low-end market prefer the prepaid service because there are no fixed monthly charges; the availability of the cellphone service depends on the amount of load credits they purchase. Retailers get a percentage commission from the load amount they sell.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":394355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

He is 47 years old, married, and the father of six children: 26, 24, 18.10, 6 and 3 years old. All go to school apart from the three year old. He completed ninth grad, but stopped when he did his national military service. He lives with his family in his own home, and supports two grandchildren who live with him.  \r\n\r\nHe left Zamb\u00e9zia for Maputo when he finished his military service in 1980, and later decided not to return to his birthplace. He established residence in Boane after he was discharged and began to work as a receptionist at an information agency (Jornal Noticias). He does not supervise other employees, and earns a monthly salary of 9,028 MZN that he uses to pay his household expenses, still managing to save some in his bank account. \r\n\r\nHe has never taken out loans with other banks, and learned about Hluvuku through his neighbors who are already clients. This is his fourth loan, for 22,100 MZN, which he will use to purchase construction materials (cement, stone, sand, galvanized roofing sheets, etc.) to continue constructing his house. \r\n\r\nIn the future he would like to apply for additional loans to complete his home and provide more comfort for his family. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by David Kaisel, Kiva

Nelyn is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Nelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Coming from an area where cattle raising is popular, Sherali has been selling cattle since 2002. He buys them in his village from the farmers who raise them and then sells them at the markets. As his business capital is limited, he buys just a few and then after he sells those, he returns to buy more. Today Sherali would like to expand his business by increasing his capital, so that he can then maximize his profits. For this reason, he is requesting this first loan to purchase young cattle and fodder for them. This will be his first loan with IMON International, and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 31 years old and the mother of two children.  They live in a rented house.  She decided to become a vegetable merchant at the local market and also rent farmland for growing garlic or any other product that she could sell at the market for a good price.  This is how Janeth earns her living.  She sells every day, beginning in the early hours, so that she can generate a daily income.  In the meantime, she waits for the harvest season so that she can obtain additional capital to help cover the needs of her family.  Janeth must always hire help in order to complete the harvest.  Seeing that her businesses are profitable, Janeth tries whenever possible to increase her inventory of vegetables as well as elevate the amount she plants so that she will achieve a larger harvest.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is the fourth time she has worked as part of a group with MFP.  Janeth is very pleased to be part of solidarity group since working with a small number of people has allowed her to become close with the other members.

She finds that it is more convenient for her to rent.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":814200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Land Rental","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay the rent on farmland for cultivation.

Her business is located in the city of Cartagena, where she lives with her family.  Leyda started her business two years in order to address the need to generate additional income so that she could provide for the welfare of her household.  She began with a small amount of capital that was given to her by her husband.  Leyda offered a few products on credit to neighbors whenever she visited them.  Being a good observer, she started offering new products and her customer base gradually grew.  She also provided new services when she rented out her first washing machine.  Over time, Leyda bought two more and wants to continue growing because she cannot stop the demand for this service.  With each passing day, her capacity to respond is insufficient.  It is for this reason that she is applying for a Kiva loan.  She wants to acquire two additional washing machines as well as cosmetics and household products to fulfill her orders.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Leyda\u2019s second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, the organization that helped her to buy her own house.

The lack of a family has worked out well for her, because she takes care of her niece along with her daughter, who lost her parents at a very young age; they have been a great joy for Carmen.

Siete de veinte y cinco clientas est\u00e1n solicitando los montos m\u00e1s altos dentro de la instituci\u00f3n, mientras que la gran mayor\u00eda est\u00e1n solicitando pr\u00e9stamos promedios. Es importante notar que esta carrera \u00e9xitosa lo han logrado en cuesti\u00f3n de dos a tres a\u00f1os. \r\n<P>La gran mayor\u00eda de mujeres en las Clavelitas son dotadas tejedoras que trabajan elaborando trajes t\u00edpicos aut\u00f3ctonas del \u00e1rea rural en Guatemala. Los productos m\u00e1s comunes son: huipiles (blusas de algod\u00f3n), cortes (faldas), fajas y blusas (poli\u00e9ster). \r\n<P>Estas mujeres salieron adelante en el mundo textil porque antes muchas elaboraban el tejido para un comercializador, sin embargo ahora con el cr\u00e9dito que reciben ellas se han convertido en tejedoras y comercializadoras al mismo tiempo. La mayor\u00eda de se\u00f1oras van a utilizar su pr\u00e9stamo para comprar hilos y tejidos para elaborar sus trajes tradicionales. Otras van a utilizar su pr\u00e9stamo para comprar ganado para su respectiva crianza y venta.\r\n<P>Las se\u00f1oras de las Clavelitas esperan prosperar para poder ampliar su negocio, su casa o  comprar un terreno. El \u00e9xito de su negocio depende del capital que puedan obtener para ampliar su negocio. \u00a1Es por eso que es importante apoyarlas!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":120299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"This loan is going to be used to purchase threads and other goods in order to be able to make traditional dresses.

In the future she would like to open a restaurant or maybe, since her daughter is a beautician, a beauty salon. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":276465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy soft drinks, beer and candy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-02-22T19:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":160,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.32,"local_amount":95.38,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":104.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084914},{"amount":70.68,"local_amount":64.62,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-25T07:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":70.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439282}],"funded_date":"2009-02-22T20:12:07Z","paid_date":"2009-06-25T07:45:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Molly Puglisi","image":null}},{"id":95079,"name":"Dominika","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dominika M. is 35 years old and married, with three children ages 15, 6 and 3.

D. is 36 years old and is married with four children.  She sells vegetables.  Katia\u2019s husband works as a motorcycle taxi driver.  \r\n\r\nKatia has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for three years and belongs to the communal bank \u201cMadres Coraje\u201d (Mothers with Courage).  Katia plans to invest this loan of 1000 soles in local agricultural products to sell at her vegetable stand.

She lives with her husband and children in a rented apartment in a town called Kade. Most of the town's inhabitants are involved in farming and other trading activities. Esther is in the fish selling business. She buys smoked fish from nearby fishing communities, then hawks her goods in her own community as well as selling at the local market. Esther has been in this business for 15 years. She hopes to obtain a loan to procure goods in bulk in order to expand her business. She believes the loan will help her inject more working capital into her trade in order to enable her to make enough income to support her family and ensure her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":426121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fish in bulk for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Kade","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2009-11-15T03:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":119.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110760339},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-04T09:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":119.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118149041},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-26T07:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":119.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123987177},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T08:26:57Z","rounded_local_amount":119.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129017848},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-20T08:21:36Z","rounded_local_amount":119.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136742684},{"amount":83.32,"local_amount":116.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":119.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144775467}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T15:23:18Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:02:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":156719,"name":"Tapaga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tapaga L. is a 41-year-old woman living in the town of Taga.

His shoemaking business began when he was still a young boy and he used to help his father.  This was his first training in this field, where he learned how to be on his own.  Later on, he worked for several shoemaking companies where he deepened his knowledge and experience.  However, his salary as an employee was not sufficient because he wanted to be independent.  \r\n\r\nHe took the leap and started his own business.  It was quite an effort but, for the last four years, he has had his own cobbler\u2019s shop where he manufactures shoes for women, men and children.  He works based on prior orders from his customers.  Antonio designs the shoes according to the latest fashions and his customer\u2019s needs and wishes.  His greatest challenge is to be up-to-date on innovations so that he can always be on the cutting edge of his field so he must be aware of what\u2019s in the latest kraft journals, he must visit shoe stores, observe artists, and do whatever is necessary to be tuned into supply, demand, and the latest fashions, in order to offer his customers the very best.\r\n\r\nAntonio is 35 years old and is a cheerful and calm person.  He lives in his own house, which is in Atl\u00e1ntico department.  He\u2019s married and has two children, 11 and 14 years old, who he wants to see intensely studying so that they may become professionals with opportunities for well-being.  He wants his business to grow because that represents improving his family\u2019s standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation; he\u2019s asking for $1.500.000 which will be used to buy raw materials in larger quantities such as, synthetic strap material, soles, leather, toe pieces, especially glue-on.  He hopes some day to have his own line of shoes and is gradually preparing himself for that end.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":481811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To buy shoemaking raw materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-02-02T06:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonio Jos\u00e8","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109233},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113592},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115958},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118374},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120840},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123358},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125928},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128551},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131229},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133963},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136754},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142220}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.44},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.69},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.91},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.74},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.06},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.42},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.21},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.44,"local_amount":109233,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":111745.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949034},{"amount":58.69,"local_amount":113592,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":116204.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677823},{"amount":59.91,"local_amount":115958,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":118625.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712197},{"amount":61.16,"local_amount":118374,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":121096.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895702},{"amount":62.43,"local_amount":120840,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":123619.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636027},{"amount":128.8,"local_amount":249286,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":255019.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410760},{"amount":203.43,"local_amount":393743,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":402799.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688027},{"amount":144.14,"local_amount":278974,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":285390.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000687}],"funded_date":"2010-02-02T10:28:12Z","paid_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":177535,"name":"Wilson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilson M. is a young entrepreneur who is 31 years old.

He is very experienced and has the special skills in livestock care that help him to develop his business. He raises and sells livestock and sells meat and milk. \r\n\r\nMuzafar is requesting a loan of 5,000 Somoni to enable him to purchase a second dairy cow. The second cow will enable him to increase the milk produced and will provide income security to the family when one of the cows is with calf.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The fifteen women know each other well, living as neighbors in a rural village just outside of Chimaltenango.  Now, in addition to being neighbors, they are learning to become confidants and support each other in business, sharing ideas for success, and helping one another overcome obstacles.  After the success of their first loan, other women took note and have joined the group. The veteran members will teach them about solidarity and responsibility within the group. They are confident of their ability to repay, and excited to take on this new challenge. <\/P> \r\n\r\n<P>All fifteen women are weavers, crafting beautiful \"huipiles,\" the traditional Mayan blouse, whose intricate designs reveal a woman\u2019s hometown, marital status, or beliefs.  A single huipil C. take up to three months to produce, working all day.  After an initial investment of about $30-$50, it C. be sold for up to $200.  The women also save money by weaving for themselves, rather than buying from others.<\/P>  \r\n\r\n<P>They are asking for a loan of 24,000 quetzales, about $3150 USD, with which they will purchase thread in bulk to weave the huipiles, as well as skirts and belts and other crafts. Some of the women sell their weaving in markets in the nearby town of Chimaltenango, and most are well known in their own village and receive orders from friends and neighbors.  Buying in bulk drastically lowers the cost of thread, and it also cuts back on the trips that must be made to the market to buy materials, saving on time and travel expenses.<\/P>      \r\n\r\n<P>The women are excited about their loan and the possibility of better providing for their families. They dream of being able to support their children in school past 6th grade, opening up opportunities for them that will help stop the cycle of poverty within their families.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>(The two

Thi Mai, 46 years old, has been participating in the Fund for 5 years.  In the beginning, she borrowed 700,000 VND to invest in raising livestock.  Besides livestock, the family also has a very stable income stream from her husband's field tilling service.  With an income of 3,000,000 VND\/month, Mrs. Mai's family is seeing a steady improvement in their quality of life.  Her two children can also go to school.  In this round of funding she would like to borrow 10,000,000 VND to invest in a water pump and a new tilling machine to provide better service for the locals.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from

The goal of Margarita is to stock her store and improve her house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy Schapiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":444456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"The purchase of a cart","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:24Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118526},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":250.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954300},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":250.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987304}],"funded_date":"2010-01-02T08:27:22Z","paid_date":"2010-04-23T07:55:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Schapiro","image":null}},{"id":165007,"name":"Ana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana P. is 32 and married with 6 children.  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Ana has many years of experience in this business.  Ana needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 750 talas or US $313 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nAna joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ana's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ana P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Lan has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,749,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future.  She is now requesting a new loan of 3,079,800 VND which will be used to purchase more baby livestock to raise and sell.

and other businesses needing excellent customer specialists.   LaToya has hired a staff with extensive experience in customer service and LaToya herself has experience working in the call center industry.  Their combined experience gives Prosperous Staffing the know-how to be the bridge connecting the gap between employer and employee.  With many companies operating call centers in Houston, LaToya recognized the opportunity for a niche staffing agency that knows the ins and outs of the industry.  \r\n\r\nLaToya is using this loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana to purchase business cards, brochures, workers compensation insurance, and to update her business\u2019 website.  When LaToya first opened Prosperous Staffing in 2009, she relied solely on her savings to get the business up and running.  Looking back, she realizes that a lack of financing prevented her from starting the business with enough resources to be effective, which is why she turned to ACCION Texas-Louisiana after temporarily closing her business.   This loan gave her the means to re-launch and aggressively advertise her business.  Having just celebrated the re-launching of her business on May 2, LaToya is running her business full-time and has engaged the help of a part-time recruiter and a part time field worker.  \r\n\r\nLaToya credits her parents with giving her the confidence to be a small business owner.  After working for years in Corporate America, she decided it was time for her to create her own opportunity.  LaToya is utilizing the business counseling services offered by the Houston Minority Supplier Diversity Council and the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise Association for networking and instruction in business development.  LaToya\u2019s goal is to establish Prosperous Staffing as the premier staffing agency for call centers in the greater-Houston area.  When the time comes, she will expand Prosperous Staffing to other markets where call centers have a strong presence.   \r\n\r\nCheck out LaToya\u2019s website at http:\/\/www.prosperousstaffing.com

This is because cheese is the base for many delicious foods, and it is also used as finger food during Christmas and New Year's parties. She has the following message for Kiva lenders:\r\n\"Thank you for supporting me. In return, I will be punctual with my repayments.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":576515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She has been doing it to increase family's income. Her husband's income is Rp700,000.00 (about US$77)\/month. That amount is certainly not sufficient. Daily expenses are about Rp30,000.00 (about $3.30), rent for house and food stall. Although her 2 children are independent, she has to work. The rice stall business gives her gross profit of Rp100,000 (about $11). The distance she has to take between her house and her rice stall is about 2 km.  Her rice stall location is quite strategic. One factor is that the road is quite busy. That fact is also supported that the food Sadwathi sells are liked by her customers. Also the many building laborers working around Sadwathi's food-stall. Raw materials prices are quite high, but this mother relies on capital to buy enough raw materials. The to be obtained loan would be used to add to her capital.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSadwathi memiliki usaha warung nasi. Dia menekuni usaha ini untuk menambah penghasilan keluarga. Penghasilan suaminya per bulan Rp 700.000,00. Uang sejumlah itu tentu saja masih belum mencukupi. Biaya hidup per hari Rp 30.000,00, kontrakkan baik untuk rumah maupun untuk warung nasinya. Walaupun kedua anaknya sudah mandiri, dia harus bekerja. Usaha warung nasinya ini memberikan keuntungan kotor per hari mencapai Rp 100.000,00. Jarak yang harus dia tempuh dari rumah menuju warung \u00b1 2 km. Letak warung nasinya cukup strategis. Salah satu faktornya jalur yang melewatinya cukup ramai. Hal tersebut juga didukung oleh makanan yang dijual Sadwathi diminati oleh pelanggan. Hasilnya penjualannya pun sangat bagus. Hal ini ditambah dengan banyaknya buruh bangunan yang bekerja di sekitar warung Sadwathi. Harga bahan baku sekarang memang cukup tinggi, tapi ibu ini memanfaatkan modal yang ada untuk membeli bahan baku yang cukup. Pinjaman yang dia peroleh akan dia manfaatkan untuk menambah modal yang sudah dia miliki."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":75630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy rice, vegetable and spices\r\n<p>Membeli beras, sayur, dan bumbu.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-16T23:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nyoman Sadwathi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-31T00:30:41Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":125,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T04:27:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85266},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-31T08:48:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":105300},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-30T03:01:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124114},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144905},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-31T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":169889}],"funded_date":"2007-10-17T00:30:41Z","paid_date":"2008-03-31T10:05:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":25456,"name":"Aisha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aisha is a small entrepreneur owning a pharmacy shop.

In order to overcome this situation, Yarlin Yohanna purchased a solar panel, and therefore, she seeks the support of CEPRODEL, which she hopes will provide her with a loan that will allow her to finish paying the solar panel , which she and her family use to get their at their humble home.\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Antonella Sacconi, Kiva Volunteer, <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align='justify'> \r\nYarlng Johanna es habitante del municipio de Achuapa en la ciudad de Le\u00f3n teniendo su negocio de agricultura dedic\u00e1ndose a la siembra de semilla en su localidad.

Al querer superar esta situaci\u00f3n ha adquirido un panel solar y para ello muy responsablemente busca apoyo en CEPRODEL para obtener un cr\u00e9dito que le permita cancelar la deuda del panel y

Her food stand is quite popular in her neighborhood and has enabled her to save enough to establish a general store adjacent to her house. She also makes and sells banana cue. Banana cue is made of fried bananas on skewers that are coated with sugar and cooked until the sugar caramelizes.\r\n\r\nThe income her business generates helps her cover household expenses. Over the years, she has been able to pay to build her house and to create a savings for future security. Although she's been in this business for over 20 years now, she still enjoys managing the daily activities. She now earns about PHP 9,000 per month. Her last loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon was her 19th one and she borrowed PHP 19,500, which she used as additional capital for her business. This time around, she intends to borrow PHP 22,000 for her 20th cycle to reinvest further into her food vending business.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

She owns a business venture, selling traditional handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Faasaveve has many years of experience in this business.  Faasaveve needs a loan of WST $1000 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Faasaveve joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faasaveve's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faasaveve T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He has a few physical laborers to help provide his service. He receives a lot of orders from his clients to construct their houses. \r\n\r\nHe has another partner in his wife, who appears in the picture above. She sells meat to people who eat it with beer or wine in the village. \r\n\r\nMr. Suon N. has three children, one of whom is married and lives independently, and the other two are students and dependent on him.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Their three children are all in school: with one in college, another in high school, and the youngest in elementary.\r\n\r\nNerissa finished midwifery but chose to do a business related to transportation. They presently own vehicles which are for hire, mainly by companies. Nerissa also has a small business in rag-making. Altogether, the net earnings of the family per month amount to P11,960. \r\n\r\nNerissa is applying for a loan of P12,000, which she plans to use to register two of her vehicles to be officially used in business. She would also use the loan to improve the conditions of the vehicles by changing the color and adding some accessories.\r\n\r\nAt present, Nerissa finds the daily collections from the business difficult. Sometimes, the vehicles are penalized for violation, which adds up expenses. At times, the vehicles get damaged and need repairs. However, Nerissa still hopes and believes that God has destined her for a greater purpose. She dreams to own a bigger business with more vehicles that would cater to many more companies in Metro Manila and beyond. She also hopes that her rag-making business will increase in sales. She aims for these breakthroughs in business because, at the bottom line, she aspires to buy her family their own house and lot.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":584502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Towards vehicle registration and maintenance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-08-17T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nerissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":11.46,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":518.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821736},{"amount":11.46,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":518.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172088980},{"amount":126.04,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5699.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380346},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2072.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816688},{"amount":80.21,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3627.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652671}],"funded_date":"2010-08-17T06:43:49Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":227066,"name":"Rahimjon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
