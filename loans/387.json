The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

She resides in the beautiful Ayacuchana forest, located in the Palmapampa locality, where she has her own home.  She barely finished primary school due to her family's economic resources and the instability caused by terrorism in her area.  Years later, she was able to establish herself in her community.  She got married and had children, but she went through many years of turmoil and challenges before she successfully opened her grocery store.  Nowadays, she is happy with what she has accomplished.  Her experience taught her to visualize the opportunities when confronted with problems.  Well-established in her business, she hopes to expand her shop by obtaining new products but in larger bulks, in order to sell more at a cheaper price.  Her store is located in the same locality where she lives and on occasion she receives help from her children, whom are the reason for why she continues to work hard.  This is her first loan with MFP.  She is very grateful for the opportunity that the bank gives her and she promises to pay back the determined loan payments.  In addition, she is grateful for the responsibilities that the communal bank gives to each one of its members.  She plans to invest the money that she is applying for on purchasing basic products to stock her store with.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy Quan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":527753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-24T13:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:55Z","rounded_local_amount":500.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154034}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T15:38:23Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracy Quan","image":null}},{"id":198792,"name":"Mrs. Thach Eam Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These fourteen people live in Ping Pong village in Kandal province and they have requested a village bank loan.

Sadly, due to a lack of economic resources and the need to work to support his parents, Ricardo hasn't been able to study the field of Information Technology, but he would very much like to do so.  In his free time he likes to listen to music and at times cook a delicious seco de pato, a duck leg confit in black beer sauce over cilantro rice, to share with his family.\r\n\r\nBy his own initiative, with a lot of effort and dedication, Ricardo works as a laborer in an agricultural farm in his city.  He works everyday from early in the morning and can do it for approximately 10 hours.  He feels at ease carrying out his work and believes that it's going well because of his good performance and his kind treatment of everyone else.\r\n\r\nRicardo is very thankful to encounter Kiva, since thanks to the help offered he will be able to buy two beds, since currently he and his two younger brothers share the same room where they only have one bed.  In this manner Ricardo can offer greater wellbeing and security to his family, and he will continue working and making an effort to achieve his dream of being a good professional."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1278415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy two beds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":71.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70.99},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":75.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":81.19},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.71},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":87.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91.38},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":94.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":98.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":102.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.4},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.47},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kerry George","image":null}},{"id":604904,"name":"Minerva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Minerva works hard to support her family.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":227708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more rice in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-21T13:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eliza J.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":81818.18},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":81818.18},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":81818.18},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":81818.18},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":81818.18},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":81818.18},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":81818.18},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":81818.18},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":81818.18},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":81818.18},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":81818.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":81818.18,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":84545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14887017},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":81818.18,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":84545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436277},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":81818.18,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":84545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130549},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":81818.18,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":84545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027346},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":81818.18,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":84545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613348},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":81818.18,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":84545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010429},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":81818.18,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":84545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232740},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":81818.18,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:42Z","rounded_local_amount":84545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664556},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":81818.18,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:40Z","rounded_local_amount":84545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105287},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":81818.18,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":84545.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022432},{"amount":68.2,"local_amount":81818.2,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":84545.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867686}],"funded_date":"2008-11-23T21:30:44Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":79147,"name":"Beatriz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Beatriz tiene 33 a\u00f1os, es casada, vive con  su esposo y su hijo.

Young Hect\u00f3r has a 5-year old son who attends primary school in the 2nd grade. His wife does domestic work but does not have a job. His goals are to maintain his customer base, since they make his success and growth possible, and to offer them essential services. His dreams are to strengthen his business to the point of having better coverage, since his customers seek the best technology offered and, furthermore, not all their needs are met. His wishes are to increase his Internet capabilities because he has limited equipment, and his customers leave for lack of equipment. He does not have sufficient space for the installation of more equipment with which he could bring in a better income for his family and pay his contracted debts with the institution.\r\n<p>\r\nH\u00e9ctor works in Internet services. The location of his business is a half block north of Dilectus. He has run his business for three years. H\u00e9ctor started his business because it was his dream, along with his bigger dream to become independent with his business. He started off by making acquaintances with others who have experience in the business. One of his friends offered him the opportunity to work in his Internet caf\u00e9 while saving what he could of his pay, and little by little he earned enough to buy a computer. He then bought another computer from a friend at a good price because, to obtain three computers later on, he would sell him another. Starting off with two computers was very difficult because the cost of each computer was high, but seeing that the profits from his Internet caf\u00e9 were very low, he acquired another computer to make three computers. He decided to look into loan options to pay off outstanding accounts. Since this time he has worked with the Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000. Now he is requesting a loan to invest in his business. He would like to add Internet accessories and improve his equipment and the resolution of his programs. He would be pleased to work with the Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000, and the organizations that contribute to its cause, to be able to make this investment.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":266077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Business Investment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-10T19:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hector Rafael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400052},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092050},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985433},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446048},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956685},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055583},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599716},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035607},{"amount":200,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948011}],"funded_date":"2009-02-10T22:35:59Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T21:43:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Towle","image":225476}},{"id":91435,"name":"Adegoke","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adegoke O. is 36 years old and married with 2 children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With that she can increase her income and be able to provide better opportunities in education for her children since she herself did not complete secondary school. It\u2019s because of this that she came to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad (Reality Foundation) with 9 others to form a group that they call \u201cThe Stars of the Sea.\u201d The majority of the group sells low-cost food, clothing and general goods.

Luc\u00eda has spent more than 25 years working, from the beginning buying and selling clothing and shoes.  Now she also has motorcycles, cars, and furniture.

Thanks to the help of the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, she has been able to build a house and improve the lives of her three children, who are currently between 26 and 30 years of age. She has had to do this alone, as she is the female head of the family.  Her greatest dream is to leave a business to each of her children so that they might not depend on her, and with this goal two of them are studying in SENA (a Colombian vocational college).<br

This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. \r\n\r\nEpifania is requesting a new loan of 2,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Epifania from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married and a mother of 4 children.

But since she began receiving loans from Ceprodel, she has been able to invest money to build her business, little-by-little, and at the same time been able to supply ingredients for her food.  Her greatest wish is to have more customers so that she can obtain better earnings and reinvest them in the business and in the needs of her children in her home.

It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership consists mostly of farmers, fishermen and small business entrepreneurs.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He has his own home where he lives with his wife and six children.  Ever since he was a young man, Victor has been dedicated to agriculture, growing lettuce, spinach, and aromatic herbs according to the season.  Since then farming has become a constant activity, continually applying compost and plowing the land to ensure that the crops receive the best care.  Occasionally he receives the help of his wife and children, specifically with the harvesting of his products so that they can be sold.  It is very important for Victor to continue cultivating his land and looking for sales strategies that will generate more profits.  His greatest wish is to have a farm with ducks, chickens, guinea pigs, and rabbits since he already has a space at his house that is set aside for this purpose.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his tenth loan with MFP.

Jeogelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Jeogelyn is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the second loan taken out by Jeogelyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

He lives with his wife of 14 years, Julia. They have three children together, who they care for with great love in a house that they own in the locality of Palca. When he was just 14 years old, Arebalo started down the agricultural path. His positive attitude towards his work has helped him to earn good profits. His main crops consist of potatoes, peas, beans, and carrots. He takes great care of his crops but it is difficult for him to work without support. Sometimes he has very long work days, which reduces the time he has to sell his harvest at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.\r\n\r\nHe splits his time with another business buying and selling animals like cows, bulls, horses, and sheep. He also has two bulls of the Brown Swiss breed, which are his greatest possession. As a good merchant, he has to bring his animals to the city of Huancayo once per month, where he sells them at a good price. Now, Arebalo is preparing to start his second and final harvest of the year, and he is sure that he will obtain good results thanks to his efforts and desire to get ahead.\r\n\r\nArebalo belongs to the \"Santo Domingo\" communal bank and this is his first loan through Microfinanzas Prisma. He hopes to receive a small loan to help him achieve his goals. He is very grateful for the support being offered to him and promises to make his repayments on time.

Mrs. Felicita now has the desire to give the remaining 2 underage children the same level of assistance towards their education and quality of life in order to set them up for their future.

They are now on their fourth group loan, with all the earlier loans correctly reimbursed. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, each of them intends to buy 450 kg of n\u00e9r\u00e9 grains (which come from an oil-producing tree native to the Sahel region) and firewood. The n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds are boiled and then ground and crushed in mortars to make the paste. The cycle production and sale) takes 3 weeks. <P>\r\n\r\nThe soumbala that they produce is goes to Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali) and often to Senegal to be sold for cash or credit to wholesalers. Once they have concluded the sale, they buy high quality \"pagnes\" (lengths of brightly colored batik-like cloth) that they re-sell in the village. <P>\r\n\r\nThey each expect to make a monthly average profit of 28,000 F CFA  and their ambition is to become important producers who supply the whole region with soumbala.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":207196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of raw materials (n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds and firewood) to produce soumbala","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou Koulikoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-10-01T07:04:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-16T09:54:16Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":50370.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350958},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":50370.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974021},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:36Z","rounded_local_amount":50370.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889394},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50370.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440187},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:54Z","rounded_local_amount":50370.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135555},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50370.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033356}],"funded_date":"2008-10-02T09:54:16Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:31:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":70987,"name":"Nget","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nget S., who lives in Angk Prasath Village in Takeo Province, is both a farmer and a rice middleman who buys rice to keep in stock for later resale at a better price.

With what she earns from her work, she manages to help him cover day-to-day household expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":278042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy goods for catering ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Ago\u00e8","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":111,"posted_date":"2009-02-24T05:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noufo Wayi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":13698.98},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":13972.96},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":14252.42},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":14537.47},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":14828.22},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":15124.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":15427.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":15735.82},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":16050.54},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":16371.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.4},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.07},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.66},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.85},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.47},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.4,"local_amount":13698.98,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T23:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":14049.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27149960},{"amount":27.94,"local_amount":13972.96,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-16T01:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":14330.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36048571},{"amount":28.5,"local_amount":14252.42,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T19:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":14617.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44637575},{"amount":29.07,"local_amount":14537.47,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T04:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":14909.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53039672},{"amount":29.67,"local_amount":14828.22,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T21:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63263866},{"amount":30.25,"local_amount":15124.78,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T23:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":15511.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73704832},{"amount":30.85,"local_amount":15427.28,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T05:27:29Z","rounded_local_amount":15822.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87134398},{"amount":31.47,"local_amount":15735.82,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T09:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":16138.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97048657},{"amount":32.1,"local_amount":16050.54,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T17:08:56Z","rounded_local_amount":16461.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103894273},{"amount":32.75,"local_amount":16371.53,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":16790.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110782881}],"funded_date":"2009-02-24T05:31:17Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T18:19:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":95563,"name":"Consuelo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"CONSUELO P.

She has three daughters, one of whom lives near her and currently helps with her business.  Rosa has been earning her own income by farming, raising animals, and selling products for human consumption for more than 15 years.  Her daughter, who is married and independent, later joined her in her business venture.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn the mornings, Rosa leaves for the fields so that she can survey her farmland.  What she is able to harvest she sells either at her store or to wholesalers in the city.  At the same time, she also takes her cows and sheep to the open spaces where they can graze on fresh grass that keeps them healthy and vigorous prior to being sold.  She divides her time between these two activities.  Throughout all the time she has been working, Rosa has been able to generate a profit.  She now plans to increase her production and sell more animals.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.  Rosa promises to be responsible with her payments since she considers the loans to be useful in advancing her business.  The loan she requested will be invested in the purchase of sacks of compost for her next crop.  She will also buy two more heads of sheep.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":527815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase compost & two heads of sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-23T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1001.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449313}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T01:03:22Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":198840,"name":"Kotognogontala Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les membres du groupe Kotognogontala sont essentiellement des femmes mari\u00e9es  avec une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 30 ans,  3 enfants et  vivant la plupart dans des familles monogames \u00e0 KAMALEN SIRAKORO un des villages de la commune de Sikasso, 3\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali.\nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de satisfaire le besoin de leur client\u00e8le et sont \u00e0 leur troisi\u00e8me  pr\u00eat.

business ventures:  seaweed (guso) farming and food vending. She lives in Pulo, Brgy Cervantes, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She cultures Eucheuma seaweed (guso) along the coast line and sells it as raw material for carrageenan, a very in-demand binder used in food products. Because seaweed farming does not involve constant work, Arlen can earn additional income by selling cooked food, doubling her earning capacity.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1996 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her seaweed (guso) farming and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 15,000. \r\n\r\nArlen is now borrowing PHP 19,000 to purchase seaweed materials and use as additional capital for food vending.  This will be her 8eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Arlen aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She makes and sells \"suman\" for merienda or snacks around the village. Anna Liza has had this type of business for two years with a monthly income of PHP 3,000. She wanted to expand her business, so she requested a loan of PHP 6,000 from GDMPC to buy ingredients for \"suman\" making.\r\n\r\nAnna Liza has been a member of GDMPC for one year. She hopes that someday the \"suman\" business will be economically in demand by the public and she can continue her business with a refreshment building."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":794493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy ingredients to make \"suman\"  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Santa Cruz, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2011-06-24T10:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna Liza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6547.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250786516}],"funded_date":"2011-06-25T02:55:46Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:14:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":313575,"name":"Berdhan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Berdhan is 52 years old and lives with his wife and five children in a ger, a Mongolian yurt, in Hovd Province, Mongolia.

The Roma, commonly referred to as gypsies, are a severely marginalized group on the Balkan Peninsula of Europe.  <p>  For most of his working life, Idriz had a job at a state-run light bulb factory in Sliven.  When communism was dismantled in the mid-90s, the factory was shuttered and Idriz was out of work with very few transferable skills.  Being in his mid-50s at the time, Idriz and those of his generation were in a particularly tough spot.  Under communism, he was not paid a significant amount and did not have considerable savings as he trusted that the state would continue providing for him in his retirement.  Unfortunately, that has not happened.  Those in his age range have been the hardest hit by the transition to free markets. Idriz\u2019s pension from the government totals approximately 35EUR per month.  <p> To support himself, he started a barbershop in the Roma ghetto of Sliven.  He charges 1EUR a haircut, 0.5EUR for a shave.  He is happy to have a way to support himself and is always thrilled when he can buy something for one of his four grandchildren with his earnings.  Idriz\u2019s shop runs on a tight budget, with a significant amount of the earnings from one week going to buy new supplies for the next week.

It was five years ago when Bertha Alicia\u2019s cousin noticed that she had an excellent work ethic, so he helped her to move her small business a local market close to her house.  Since then she has not had the means to paint the roofless structure where she operates her business.  She has also been unable to replace the tarp that covers her place of business.  The tarp is so worn out that it practically gives no protection from the sun!  Bertha Alicia also needs funds to buy the supplies she needs to make her products.  This is why Bertha Alicia is asking for your help.  She would like you to help finance a loan of US $500 to be repaid in 6 months.  With this loan she will buy supplies for her business, paint the structure that she operates her business out of and to buy a tarp to cover that structure.  With your help you will make it so Bertha will be able to improve the appearance of her business and attract more customers.\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Johnny of San Roque High School, Kiva volunteer <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nYa que el esposo de Bertha Alicia no ten\u00eda un sueldo seguro en la empresa donde trabaja, ella se decidi\u00f3 a elaborar y vender tamales en su casa, y con el tiempo un primo de ella, vio que Bertha ten\u00eda muchas ganas de trabajar as\u00ed que le traspas\u00f3 un local en un mercadito muy cerca de su casa esto hace cinco a\u00f1os y desde entonces no a pintado la estructura de su local y tampoco a cambiado la lona que ya casi no la cubre del sol, adem\u00e1s de necesitar material para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus comidas. <p>\r\nPor eso acude a usted para que la puedan apoyar con un cr\u00e9dito de US $500 en un plazo de seis meses para poder comprar material, pintar la estructura de su local y comprar una lona.

They named their group Magbanie, after the village where the group leader was born. They are local entrepreneurs in a village called Massori, about fifteen miles from Makeni City in northern Sierra Leone. This is the second time they\u2019ve received a Kiva loan through SMT. Previously, each one of them in the group received a loan of 500,000 LE. That loan created meaningful impacts in the lives of these borrowers. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees. They\u2019re also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans. Today, they are requesting a loan of 700,000 LE each to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n<P>\r\nYabom (second from right) is the leader of the group. She is forty years of age. As noted earlier, she was born in Magbanie village. Marriage brought her to Masorie village, where today she is managing her business. She is married with one child. Her child is also married. Her husband serves as a local chief whose duties include arbitrating disputes among members of the community.\r\n<P>\r\nYabom sells local produce like palm oil and pepper. With this new loan, she will expand her business: she will be able to buy an additional ten to fifteen barters (five gallons to a barter) of palm oil to add to her current stock. In the village of Masori, a barter of palm oil cost her 30,000 LE. She will pay a fare of 14,000 LE round-trip to transport herself and the palm oil to Makeni.

Labarhan\u2019s daughter-in-law is a housewife and also looks after the family business.\r\n\r\nLabarhan and her family have land where potatoes and cotton are cultivated. For this loan Labarhan is planning to buy seed potatoes, mineral fertilizer and get prepared for sowing. She has been in this business for sixteen years. In the future her family is planning to buy additional land and also to start livestock breeding. Maybe later loans will be disbursed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nBahtiyor, 38, is the father of four children: three daughters and one son. The middle daughter is a disabled person but all the others go to school. Bahtiyor is a farmer and he will use the loan to buy cotton seed and fertilizer. Bahtiyor also keeps two bulls for breeding and wants to increase the number of his livestock.\r\n\r\nSabahathan, 55, is also a farmer. Her family has a total of 0.5 hectares (1.25 acres) of land and she cultivates potatoes and wheat there. She needs a loan to prepare for spring sowing, which requires her to plow and buy seed potatoes. She is married with one son who in turn is married and has one son. All the family members, including Sabahathan\u2019s husband, take an active role in the family business. This year Sabahathan is planning to make repairs to her house.\r\n\r\nGulanarahon is 25 years old and the youngest member of this solidarity group, but not the least. She is married with one son. She will use this loan to buy textiles to start a new business. Before getting married she helped her mother and they had a little sewing workshop. So she is planning to open her own workshop to produce garments, coverings, etc. This is her number one priority as well as to bring up a good son!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

He lives in his own home along with his daughter, who is independent.  For more than 7 years he has worked providing transportation services with his motocar (light, 3-wheeled passenger vehicle.)  He managed to buy his own motocar, the only tool of his work, thanks to his own efforts.  He gets up early in the morning and heads for his taxi stop, a place that he already established, because it lies in an area where there are large numbers of customers.  Over time he has gained the confidence of his passengers.  Juan likes his work, but he has to always maintain his motocar in good condition, since with constant use the vehicle will tend to have some problems.  That is why he wants to buy himself an automobile, so that he could provide more comfort to his passengers.  This is his 2nd loan with MFP, and he promises to be punctual with his payments as he was the last time.  With the loan he requests, he will invest in maintaining his motocar, leaving it in optimal condition so that he can work without problems. \r\n    \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":527825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to maintain his motocar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-23T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":171.26},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":185.26},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":188.04},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":194.85},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":203.19},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":209.26},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":217.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":224.71},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":232.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.94},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.52},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.84},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.82},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.2},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.11},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.24},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.65},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.41,"local_amount":164.03,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":164.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751965},{"amount":59.01,"local_amount":168.6,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":168.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934422},{"amount":62.65,"local_amount":179,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":179.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673190},{"amount":64.67,"local_amount":184.77,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":185.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887017},{"amount":66.98,"local_amount":191.38,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":191.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154042},{"amount":71.99,"local_amount":205.68,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":206.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588043},{"amount":151.74,"local_amount":433.55,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":434.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724675},{"amount":165.55,"local_amount":472.99,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":473.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462889}],"funded_date":"2010-05-18T15:31:38Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":198856,"name":"Soeurn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Soeurn S. is 47 years old and lives in Andoung Samretth village in Takeo province.

Leticia has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leticia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leticia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Leticia is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & use as working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Leticia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":672368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 46, married and has four children. Ainagul graduated from the Pedagogical University and worked at the school of Achy village as a librarian. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, her salary did not cover the expenses of her household at all. That\u2019s why, in 2004, using her start-up capital of 10,000 KGS, Ainagul started her business in trade. Year in and year out, she managed to broaden her business and earn about 30,000 KGS in a month. Her loyal customers were attracted by her optimistic attitude and cheerfulness. \r\n\r\nBut in June 2010, when violent clashes caused by the deposed political regime broke out in the Osh city, Ainagu lost her business. Her sales place was robbed and looted. \r\n\r\nHowever, Ainagul isn't giving up and is ready to resume her lost business and continue to work. For this very reason, Ainagul is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her activity. She plans to purchase more dried fruits and nuts to resell at the local market. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading microfinance institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased employment and meet the interests of its clients and

sweets.  She has done this work for two years.  She started selling in the street as a traveling vendor, and now has her own stand.  She is a single mother of a school-aged daughter.  She chose this type of work because it generates a good income.  The challenges she faces are transportation from her home and having to leave her daughter in the care of other people.\r\n\r\nGabina, like many people, has many dreams.  One of them is to have her own store in her home so that she can stop going out to the street.  Gabina is a fighter and a hardworking person.  She works outside of a high school from 9:00am and later moves outside a transport company, where she stays until late at night.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to purchase more merchandise for her cart, like candy, soft drinks, chocolates, and more, and also to put a small store in her home.
