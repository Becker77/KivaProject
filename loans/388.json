All the women in this group show an incredible willpower, they are cheerful and extroverted. They all work in the town of Panajachel where they bring happiness to the community whilst they work in their different activities. <p>\r\n\r\nThe women in the group are very happy because they will receive the first loan in their lives. With it, they hope to see their businesses flourish and consequently improve their standard of living.\r\nEven though this is their first loan, all of them have ventured to ask the highest amount that can be given as an initial loan (263USD per person). They are proud of themselves because it is the first time that someone, in this case Friendship Bridge and Kiva, are betting on them and believe in their capabilities. <p>\r\n\r\nMost of them will use the loan to buy and then sell clothing (both new and used) at the market or in the streets. Some will use it to buy ingredients in order to prepare food that they will sell during lunch and diner time. Others will use it to buy and sell jewelry and cosmetics. Finally, one of them is a midwife and she will use the money to buy medicines. <p>\r\nThe midwife is the town's doctor and she takes care of the deliveries, mostly those of indigenous women. Moreover, she also assists with other sicknesses. <p>\r\n\r\nMany of them dream of having their own shops so they don\u2019t have to be street vendors. Others want to pay their first loan in order to show themselves that they are capable of having a good business. <p>\r\nThey all dream of having sound businesses that will allow them to count on a steady income and of course, they all dream about the general wellbeing of their families and community.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe women of the group \u201cBrisas del lago Panajachel\u201d only need an initial support so they can move forward, please help them with this credit and they will not let you down.

Because her husband passed at an early age, she has had to work as a single parent to care for her two young children. Ch\u1ecb M. has participated in the TYM Fund since 2003. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning, she borrowed capital for rearing livestock to produce income for the family but after a while, she realized that the business did not help them bring in much income. Therefore, she diligently borrowed funds to invest in a retail business selling sundries. Currently their income is 2,000,000 VND and is also the main source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nFor this loan cycle, she would like to borrow an additional 9,000,000 VND to purchase more improved personal sundries\/items that are in demand and from there increase the family's income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Catherine Tran, Kiva

This is 25-year-old Esta M. from Kyela. She is married with one child. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphans. Esta has been running a crops-selling business since 2006. Client\u2019s business is buying crops from farmers and bringing them to town where she can sell them at a higher price. \r\n<P>\r\nShe works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Esta currently earns about 100 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 325 USD in order to purchase more cacao and rice in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity of cacao and rice that she buys in bulk. Esta thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

She is 35 years old, single, and went to school through the 10th grade.  She is the mother of a 14 year old son who is in the 7th grade.\r\n\r\nRute is a native of Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland.  She had to interrupt her schooling when she began working in the Hotel Xissaka as the secretary of the Director.  She worked there 5 years but due to a change in supervision she was one of the ones excluded, and she lost her job.  Years later her in-laws kicked her out of the house alleging that her Bantu language was not the same as that of her husband.  She lost her home and was suffering.\r\n\r\nIn the same year she was selected to receive a recompensation from the Hotel Xissaka in the amount of 15,000MT.  She decided to begin her own business of selling bedding that she acquired in South Aftica and resold in the Capital.  She has travels 3 times each month and has many customers and orders for products like sheets, blankets, duvets, vases, curtains, carpets...etc.  She spends 35,000MT with each trip, and after resales she earns 9,000MT.\r\n\r\nShe approached Hluvuku when she lost her home in a fire caused by a short circuit in the wires of Mozambique Electricity, and they would not take responsibility for the accident.  Rute is requesting a loan for 15,000MT from Hluvuku to make repairs on her home.  Besides her son she is also supporting her mother who lives in her house, and she gives her 1,000MT every three months.\r\n\r\nThis is Rute's first loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva.  The 15,000MT will be used to purchase construction materials to make repairs on her home that was consumed by the fire.

Her husband earns an average net income of just 2,700 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month (about $58 US) from labor and because of this they have experienced hardships in raising their children.  \r\n\r\nTo help her husband, Armelinda decided to engage in charcoal buying and selling. For 6 years, she was able to sustain it even in times of crisis. Currently she is earning an average net income of not less than 3,600 PHP (about $78 US) a month, which is very helpful in supporting the family. \r\n\r\nShe joined PAGLAUM MPC just this year because she is very much interested in our products and services and for our being one of the most outstanding cooperatives in Northern Mindanao: we were named Most Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines during the search for COOP-LGU Partnership Award 2006. \r\n\r\nAs this is her second loan, Armelinda was allowed to request a loan of 8,000 PHP to add her capital for her business. She will use the future income from this business for her family's daily needs and to save for her children's

Due to social reasons he decided to leave Koranic school studies to start earning money from a friend of his. He learnt to buy and sell cowhides. With 8 years' experience, Mr. Broulaye Samak\u00e9 is very good at his job. In order to access a reliable working capital he decided to work with the Soro Yiriwaso loan programme to buy a large amount of cowhides. This is his first time with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. He buys his stock in Bougouni and in the local area. His customer base is made up of shoemakers and retailers in the subregion. With this loan he hopes to earn a monthly profit of 65,000 FCFA which will meet his needs and grow his business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Lara Francis, Kiva

He is married to his beloved wife, 24-year old Esmeralda, and they have a 5-month old son called Wilder. \r\n\r\nAlfonso believes that his job growing coffee, bananas, and pineapples is well-rewarded and that any sacrifice he makes is worthwhile. For these reasons he has worked as a farmer for 15 years. Something else that makes the job less hard is the fact that his wife works alongside him. However, at harvest time and when the fields need weeding, he hires workers to help and pays them 20 soles per day.\r\n\r\nAlfonso most enjoys keeping his fields healthy and setting traps for rodents and insects so they don\u2019t harm his crops. This generous family man who loves to have his family by his side wants to increase production of bananas and coffee. As there is a great demand for them in the markets, he gets good money for his produce. In the future he plans to start a home-based business selling groceries so that his wife can look after it and stop working in the fields. This way she will be better able to take care of their son.\r\n\r\nThis is Alfonso\u2019s third loan with Kiva partner MFP and he says he is very happy to continue working with his community group as they are responsible and enterprising people like him. He also says that every decision he makes is supported by his wife. With the loan he will buy several bags of fertilizer to spread on his fields. He will also hire some workers to weed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":568655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer and hire workers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfonso ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2539.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195460}],"funded_date":"2010-08-02T20:36:23Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":218967,"name":"Franz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Franz Radica en la localidad de el torno distante a 39 km de la ciudad de Santa Cruz, tiene 7 hijos de los cuales tres est\u00e1n con el y los dem\u00e1s ya se casaron y se independizaron, vive en el barrio Miraflores de dicha localidad en casa en alquiler, su ocupaci\u00f3n es herrero, es decir construcci\u00f3n de canaletas para casa, verjas, ventanas, esta actividad es la \u00fanica fuente de ingreso, el destino del cr\u00e9dito es para compra materiales como Hierro, clavos, soldador y as\u00ed poder cubrir sus pedidos, su esposa se dedica a labores del hogar; es cliente nuevo en la instituci\u00f3n y en el sistema financiero y esta muy contento por la oportunidad que le brindan.","en":"Mr. Franz Radica, in El Torno, 39 kilometers from the city of Santa Cruz, has seven childred, three of whom still live with him.

Th\u1ecb (22) is a 51-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1. Mai is the leader of a three-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 06 \u0110\u00f4ng V\u1ec7 (08.05.06 \u0110\u00f4ng V\u1ec7).\r\n\r\nMai is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Mai runs a general store. Mai has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000,000 VND a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mai joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Mai has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,253,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. \r\n\r\nShe is now requesting a new loan of 6,159,600 VND, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. Mai plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n\r\n1. N. Th\u1ecb L. H\u01b0\u01a1ng (19) is a 28-year-old woman who is requesting a 6,159,600 VND loan to support her business in the retail sector running a general store.\r\n\r\n2. Q.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nMai T.

She is married with two sons and two daughters. Her husband is a municipal employee with a decent salary, but he also works part time in cutting wood for sale in order to increase the family income. Ahlam wants to help her husband in purchasing a new machine for cutting wood to improve his work and increase his sales, but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Ahlam gets the loan, she will be able to help her husband to purchase this wood-cutting machine, so he will improve his work, produce more wood, and increase his sales, which will increase his income and provide the family with better living conditions. Ahlam is a conservative woman, so her husband Mohammad was photographed instead in the FATEN branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

His wife supports the family by helping out with household tasks, takes care of the kids and vends his products in different stores with her husband. He dedicates as much time in the production of the product. The manufacturing requires much investment at high costs. These investments include organic chemicals for the soil and plantations.

When she realized that this was a good business venture, she began to add items little by little and she now sells wide variety of goods including those you see in the photo.  There is a great demand for these items from tourists who come to her stall looking for handcrafted items.  She now brings in items from other locations, which insures that she is selling unique handicrafts.  This is how Cinthia maintains and increases the number of customers she attracts.\r\n<\/p>\t\r\n<p>With this loan of 800 Nuevo Sol ($275), which she will pay off in six months, Cinthia will purchase  many colors of string and different types of fabric (which she uses to make into beautiful bags).  She will also buy fabric from the indigenous Shipiba tribe which is available in Iquitos.  All of this will enable her to have a good selection of unique items for her customers.  At her young age, Cinthia is already a determined businesswoman who wants to continue expanding her business.  She is 24 years old and has a new born daughter who is her inspiration to continue to improve her situation.  With entrepreneurial vision, she hopes to have her own shop and become more independent.

He is married and has six children: three daughters and three sons. He lives with his wife and some grandchildren in a family apartment in a town called Kofiase, which is a farming\/trading community near Dormaa, the district capital, in the Brong Ahafo region. Stephen says his children are all grown and live independently. His wife is a farmer and food vendor.\r\n\r\nStephen is a commercial driver. He drives a Urvan bus (a small Nissan vehicle).

Today, once again, Homidjon faces this need but he trusts that his loan will be granted to that he can help his business and his family.\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Walaupun tingkat pendidikan yang dimilikinya masih sangat rendah, namun semangat dan keinginannya untuk meningkatkan perekonomian keluarganya sangat besar. Ni Nengah Karsini memutuskan untuk bergabung dengan program Yayasan Dinari,  khususnya program Ternak Babi yang periode pinjamannya selama 6 bulan dan pembayaran pinjaman pada akhir periode. Hal tersebut berdasarkan perhitungan masa pemeliharaan babi selama 4 \u2013 5 bulan dan bulan ke 6, peternak sudah siap menjual babinya. Pinjaman yang didapatnya dipergunakan untuk membeli induk babi dan pakan. Ni Nengah Karsini berencana untuk menjual anak babi yang dipelihara selama 2 bulan. Induk babi yang sekarang sudah mempunyai 5 ekor anak dan 2 bulan ke depan bisa dijual dengan harga Rp. 300.000.- per ekor. Induk babi yang akan dibelinya akan dipersiapkan untuk masa panen berikutnya.

The loan consultant who has been working with Ana describes her as a strong, hard-working woman with a healthy appetite for learning and big plans for the future. \r\n\r\nAna runs two businesses. Over the past 4 years, she has gained experience selling various items such as jewellery, clothing, cosmetics and shoes from her home, where she has opened a bazaar (seen in the picture). Her customers arrive daily to peruse the various products she has available for sale. This business arrangement allows Ana to take care of domestic responsibilities when business is slow, including taking care of her mother and children. \r\n\r\nHer other business is selling catalog items such as cooking utensils, appliances and clothing. For this activity, Ana travels from door to door in her community, offering catalog products to customers. She has been running her business in this way over the past four years, and she has one employee.  In a good month Ana earns 700,000 colones, in a bad month, only 300,000. \r\n\r\nAna has a large space in her home to display a varied range of products. She says competition is basically nonexistent in the area in which she lives. The majority of her clients are workers at a nearby plastic manufacturing plant; others are family members and acquaintances in the community.  Sometimes, her children help her with her business so that Ana can take care of her mother.\r\n\r\n Ana plans to use this loan to invest in both of her productive activities. She hopes to invest in the purchase of various merchandise items such as clothing, jewellery, cosmetics and cooking utensils. \r\n\r\nIn general, Ana wakes up early in order to carry out her domestic responsibilities such as preparing breakfast, cleaning the house and assisting her mother.  When she is not doing housework, she is dedicated to making sales, whether in the bazaar or on the street. Ana\u00b4s goal is to expand her business and provide a prosperous lifestyle for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":628921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"For the purchase of merchandise (clothing, jewellery, cosmetics)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"San Jos\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-30T14:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29616.64},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30110.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30612.08},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31122.29},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31640.99},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32168.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32704.48},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33249.55},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33803.71},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34367.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34939.89},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35522.23},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36114.26},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36716.17},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37312.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.22},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.23},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.24},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.41},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.73},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":59.23,"local_amount":29616.64,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":29889.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182551375},{"amount":63.92,"local_amount":31960.28,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":32254.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148792},{"amount":64.99,"local_amount":32492.95,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":32791.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428405},{"amount":66.07,"local_amount":33034.5,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":33338.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970547},{"amount":67.17,"local_amount":33585.07,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":33894.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289990},{"amount":68.29,"local_amount":34144.82,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":34458.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206158231},{"amount":69.43,"local_amount":34713.9,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":35033.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211231358},{"amount":70.58,"local_amount":35292.47,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":35617.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216510381},{"amount":470.32,"local_amount":235159.37,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":237322.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227043814}],"funded_date":"2010-11-01T07:31:48Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:15:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":247690,"name":"Henry","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el sr.

Then, as the only breadwinner, she had to find ways of supporting the family financially. Three years ago she and her oldest son spent their small savings on the purchase of a very first calf.

For Sobeida, her sewing business and sales of \"salchipapas\" (sausage and french fries) have been a source of income that has enabled her to contribute to the household expenses.  As a seamstress, she makes bed sheets and bedspreads, and at night sells salchipapas off her front porch.  She has been in business for nearly a year ,and it has done well enough for her to generate a good profit.  What she enjoys most about her job is being able to talk to the customers.  The greatest challenge she has is having to go out early to buy the ingredients for her food sales.  In the future she would like to renovate her home and set up a larger workshop.

He has lived with his spouse for 10 years and together they are raising three children under 8. This family lives in the Santo Domingo neighborhood in the Tapo district. Walter works in agriculture on cropland located in his own community. He plants peas, beans and potatoes, products that he sells on market days in the wholesalers' market in Tama. His crops sell right away and most are taken to the city of Lima for buyers who travel to that area. In this way, he has been able to support his young family and give his children a decent education in their community's school. \" It's good to work the earth, but there are days with losses too. For example, 5 years ago, I lost 2 hectares of potatoes due to frost\", he explains. He notes that thanks to that problem he learned to take care of his crops more tenaciously. Walter hopes to in time expand his land and plants more crops. He also wants to give his young children the education that he, due to lack of money, had no access to. \"My children are the most valuable thing I can have. For them I will keep working\", he remarks. This would be his 8th loan with MFP. For this is reason, he is committed to making his payments on time. At the same time, he is grateful to the organization and to his communal bank for the growth opportunity they have shown him along the way.

He is 57 years old, is married and has 8 children. He has a specialized secondary education.  He is a professional driver and also is engaged in animal husbandry. He buys young calves, feeds them for 40-45 days and then sells them at higher price, since grown calves are cost more and are used for meat. He then buys another set of young calves, feeds them and resells them. This is his business, which helps him to provide for his family, since he is a sole breadwinner of the family.  Besides that, the development of stock-raising business allows to supply nearby markets with fresh meat at affordable prices. Safar has been in this business for about 20 years. He wants to use the proceeds of his loan to purchase several calves. He plans to repay his loan within 12 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Keith & Jamilya Leitich, Kiva Volunteers. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u041d\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0435\u0432

This is 27-year-old Happy R. from Mbeya. She is married and has two children, ages 4 and 7. Happy has established a store that sells traditional clothing called kanga and vitenge, which is worn by Tanzanian women. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. \r\n\r\nHappy buys the clothing wholesale and resells it at retail prices. She works at the business for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week and is assisted by her husband. She currently earns about $300 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD to purchase additional stock of kanga and vitenge. Happy thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History <br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a middle woman in the rice business. Her husband, Mr. Huong Soeu, is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate rice to earn a living. On this plantation, he faces an obstacle because he does not have money to pay for plowing.

He is 59, married, and the father of 10 children whose ages he doesn't remember.  Three of his children go to school.  He only studied through 4th grade of the old education system and didn't continue due to the lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family and also supports 2 grandchildren that live with him.<p>\r\nHe left Marracuene for the district of Boane many years ago with his family in search of better living conditions.  He has worked as a heavy equipment operator in a quarry since 1961 and makes a monthly salary of 4,600 meticais.  He uses this money to pay for his family's expenses and still saves some at his house.  His wife sells basic products as a way of increasing their family's income. <p>\r\nHe has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through friends.  This is his 3rd loan, and it is for 10,000 meticais.  He will use it to purchase construction materials (iron, cement, sand, etc) to finish building his home.  His previous loans were for 5,000 and 10,000 meticais and were used for his business and his home, respectively.<p>\r\nIn the future, he would like to request more laons to finish his home and to offer more comfort to his family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

V., Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 38 years old. Luzviminda is the group leader of a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luzviminda is married and has seven school-aged children. To earn a living, Luzviminda owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fruits and vegetables in the local community. Luzviminda is just starting this business.<\/p>\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Luzviminda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luzviminda is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Luzviminda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n<p><strong>About ASKI:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

create a village bank through which they receive assistance in terms of loans. The main goal is to give them the opportunity to carry out economic activities which enable them to live in dignity and contribute to a better quality of life in their homes. Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. What is more, the sense of belonging to a group gives these poor women the energy and motivation to reach success.<p> \r\n\r\nIn a remote neighborhood located in Carepegua, a group of 15 women heard about the the Committee of Entrepreneuring Women and its profitable results.

old, single, and has no children. Her intentions are to maintain her business activity, after having struggled a great deal to overcome on some level, the most difficult obstacles of her life, to continue on living. Her wishes are also to make sure her products are of quality so that her clients continue coming to her in search of her products. Given that her block has a lot of competition and she doesn\u2019t want to lose the habit of selling bread, especially because it is a product that is part of neighborhood tradition. Her dream is to buy a new house so that her mother and she may live comfortably in adequate conditions for their wellbeing, because her age demands that she prepare for the future.\r\n\r\nHer economic activity is the sale of nacatamales (a Central American Tamal), bread, and soda. The location of her business is in her house. She has had it for 24 years. Do\u00f1a \u00c1gueda started her business for her mother, who was initially responsible for the business. As time passed, the quality of her mother\u2019s tamales captured the attention of many clients, and the business had a great deal of success, and her mother decided to place her daughter in charge of the business.

He is married and the father of four children. His wife doesn't work, she stays at home and takes care of the home, feeds their cattle. Komiljon feeds and sells cattle. The spring season for him is the time to purchase cattle since they are cheaper to buy. Also, it is not as expensive to feed cattle during the spring -- they eat mountain grasses, and Komiljon can save on cattle feed. In the autumn, Komiljon will sell some of his fattened cattle, but he won't buy cattle. He will buy food for the rest of his herd.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Josh Machleder, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":307496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Feeding and sale of livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.217778 69.725","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-22T00:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Komiljon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":773.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846237},{"amount":200,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":773.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110737330}],"funded_date":"2009-04-22T01:23:46Z","paid_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joshua Machleder","image":145052}},{"id":107559,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice B. is 39 years old.

This why Gulchehra is requesting a loan for the purchase of a stock of decorative cosmetics from Djordani Gold by Oriflame.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":367385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of decorative cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Taboshar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.568889 69.640278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulchehra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":132162,"name":"Nigor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Z.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

C'est pour cette raison que Marguerite sollicite un quatri\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit. ","en":"Marguerite D. was born in 1969 in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. Married to S\u00e9v\u00e9rin Zinsou, Marguerite is the mother of six children, all of whom are at school. But two of the children are no longer with the couple. The family has lived in the N\u2019Venamede district of Cotonou for almost 15 years. Both she and her husband take care of the family expenses.  To meet her needs, Marguerite sells fruit juice (lemon juice, hibiscus juice, etc.) at a school in the Suru-L\u00e9r\u00e9 district of Cotonou. As a secondary business, Marguerite sells \u201cbouillie\u201d (a type of porridge made from corn starch).  Marguerite buys her products in Dantokpa, Benin's international market. Marguerite has been running this business for about 10 years and has previously obtained three loans from ALID\u00e9, all of which she repaid. Marguerite has since experienced a drop in sales and now wants to boost her business and take a bigger share of the market. This is why Marguerite is requesting a fourth loan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":543895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy sugar, hibiscus, lemons, etc. to make fruit juice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-05-23T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marguerite ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653484},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835696},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159576093},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954607},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056264},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-27T10:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347799},{"amount":36,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":18781.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482842},{"amount":32,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":16694.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617651},{"amount":36.82,"local_amount":18411,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":19210.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191361052},{"amount":15.18,"local_amount":7589,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":7918.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779753}],"funded_date":"2010-05-23T14:54:45Z","paid_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Llewellyn","image":44015}},{"id":206741,"name":"Khlok","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Khlok P. is 32 years old and lives in Angk Svay Chek village in Takeo province.

Nilda's crops are some of the best cared-for in the town of Patay (in the Tarma province).  She grows potatoes, peas and lettuce that are of very good quality, since she has been responsible about applying organic fertilizer to her fields.  In the market of Tarma, where she sells her products, the customers seek out her crops, because she always has a good price for them.  What she likes most about her job is the harvest season, since at that time she feels that the months of hard work are rewarded.  She has been farming for 10 years.  What she considers most difficult is to protect her crops from insect infestations.  Over time, she plans to buy a stall in the wholesale market, so that she can increase her income.  This is her 8th loan with MFP, and she has always been very punctual with her payments, since she feels that she has a commitment to the institution.

After purchasing his cattle, Amir provides them with all the right conditions for their growth: taking care of their food and protection and making sure they don\u2019t get lost. Once they\u2019re fully mature, Amir sells them in his area and also provides their milk for sale. Currently he needs to purchase cattle to raise and is turning to IMON International to obtain a loan of 5,000 Somoni for this reason. Amir thanks Kiva for the support that Kiva presents to small entrepreneurs.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sarah has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy more rice, onion, vegetable oil, salt and maggi for her business. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 300,000. In the future, Sarah plans to improve the business to a store. She hopes to see her business grow to a level of making more profit, to take care of her children's education. It serves the general public. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":927536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To pay for cooking condiments such as rice, onion, vegetable oil, salt and maggi for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Bo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-11-25T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721832},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:21Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124741},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505647},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974753},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815321},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444378},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537110},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284601}],"funded_date":"2011-11-29T14:24:01Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":366588,"name":"Ukulima Mbele Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Receive greetings from Ukulima Mbele Group in Western Kenya!
