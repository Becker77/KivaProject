A little while after she decided to dedicate herself, in an ambulatory way, to selling foodstuffs and opened her grocery store near her house.\r\n<p>\r\nDue to the large demand for her typical foodstuffs, she wishes to open a caf\u00e9 in the future which will offer better and more comfortable service to the population and increase the quantity of clients.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She hopes that they continue in this manner for a long time, helping many families and entreprenurial women.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kimberly Baker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":470832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy groceries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salvadora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":358.33,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1021.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954447},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987471},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713490},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746556},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929761}],"funded_date":"2010-02-09T14:48:09Z","paid_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kimberly Baker","image":79832}},{"id":173103,"name":"My's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M\u1ef9 Th\u1ecb P. is 59 years old.

Together they take care of their only child, a daughter, in their home in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nTo cope with financial difficulties, Patricia has set up her own carinderia (food stall) located in Intramuros, Manila. Here, she cooks delicious meals for customers who find it easier to buy cooked food than to prepare their own, especially on busy days. Patricia has been running her carinderia for seven years. She is also buys and sell palay (rice grain). Her entrepreneurial efforts earn her Php11,000 per month.\r\n\r\nTo improve her carinderia, she decided to borrow Php30,000 with the help of CCT* to improve both her food business as well as her trading business. Aside from quality food ingredients, she also intends to buy palay and sell it to business connections. She plans to have small homes to rent to boarders. \r\n\r\nOne struggle Patricia faces is family finances, as the price of the goods in the market has soared. But she knows she will overcome, because the Lord of her life is one faithful Provider. She desires to see the expansion of her business and allow her family to experience prosperity. Currently, she is saving up for her child\u2019s education. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She lives with her husband and their two children in her own house.  She devotes herself to farming.  She does this work in her native land; a beautiful, rural farming village.  She has been there almost all of her life because her parents raised her there.  They taught her how to cultivate the land.\r\n\r\nShe now has a strong family, which is why she farms.  It is an important source of income for her household.  She works with her husband and her children in each season in order to grow potatoes, corn, wheat, barley, beans, and other products in her zone.  Harvest time is the busiest, and they generally need more help.  That is when they hire field workers to harvest the crops.  In both seasons she always needs cash on hand to buy seeds, to rent a yoke of oxen, and for the other needed tools.  \r\n\r\nThat is why she always requests a loan.  The loans have always helped with her financial growth.  That is the reason that she later wishes to acquire more farm land and to be a wholesaler of her harvested products.\r\n\r\nThis time she will use the loan to buy sacks of fertilizer, which is indispensable in preparing the land.  This is the eighth loan that she has requested from MFP.  She has extensive experience with loans with her communal bank, and she remembers them gratefully.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and served as the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent of arable land. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International:\r\n \r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Jacoba meets with her fellow members of the Fe Y Progreso (Faith and Progress) communal bank every two weeks.\r\n\r\nJacoba is a founding member of her communal bank, and she likes it because of the help that her loans have always given her.  She is 67, married, and has 8 children who are independent adults.  She lives with one grandson who is 18 and is like her own son.  Her husband is retired.\r\n\r\nOur friend has a grocery store in her home where she sells all kinds of products like:  rice, sugar, oils, detergents, candy, soft drinks, etc.  She works there every day from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m., and her husband helps her with her work.  She has had her store for 18 years, and she started it with her first loan that she received from the institution.  She is very grateful this since her store is her reason for living.  In addition to earning her living from it, it is also a way to distract herself with her customers.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to further stock her store.  She is going to buy rice, sugar, oil, detergents, sausages, and other basic goods.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to get ahead with her business so that it will grow more every day."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":854086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, oils, detergents, sausages, and other basic goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-08-26T02:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacoba Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227037319},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797897},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608989},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244563259},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250774234}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T15:35:34Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:04:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":333442,"name":"Marcia Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

","en":"Sanabarkhon is 60 years old and a widow. She had raised five children who have mostly left to Russia for work. Sanabarkhon had been working for twenty years as chief nurse in the local hospital and now is in retirement. Her pension is 2,800 som (KGS) monthly, which is about $60. Since the salary of medical workers in Kyrgystan is low, Sanabarkhon had started a second hand resale store back in 2000. She sells used TVs, rugs, refrigerators and the like. To further expand her second hand business Sanabarkhon has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) which she will use to expand her

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling food products such as repacked \"ginataang langka\" or green jack fruit with coconut milk in the local community. Annabella has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Annabella joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Annabella has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Annabella is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Annabella from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She lives in Prk. Yanog, Brgy. Tampalon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.\r\n\r\n By working hard in her pig-fattening and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Erenea is now borrowing PHP 12,000 so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Erenea aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She learned her trade from her parents who were <i>ginamos<\/i> makers. In 1955, when she was still a teenager, she started buying fresh krill and making her own ginamos. She sold her products in nearby towns by setting up a stand in each town's market during market day. She continued her ambulatory business even after she got married and, by then, she already had a few regular customers who came to her house to buy her <i>ginamos<\/i>. \r\n<p>\r\nBecause she wanted to expand her business, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1994 to access additional capital. She put her entire first loan into her business and she got very good returns on her investment. For the past 15 years, while she's been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has maintained her good credit standing by paying her loans on time and attending the center meetings. As her business prospered, Felicidad expanded her product lines. She now also sells <i>asin<\/i> (sea salt) and coconut wine called <i>tuba<\/i>. She earns an average monthly net income of 16,000 pesos from her business activities, and this has been a big help in defraying the family's expenses, with enough left over to pay for the education of her children in previous years. She was also able to renovate her house with her savings.\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Felicidad S. is a 69-year-old married woman with six adult children ranging in age from 31 to 42 years old. She is from Brgy. Canjusa, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. By sheer will and determination, she was able to send all of her children to school to earn their college degrees. All of them now have their own families and are gainfully employed. Their achievements have made Felicidad very proud and, for her, she has already attained her life's dream \u2013 according to her, all because she had NWTF-Project Dungganon for support all these years. \r\n<p>\r\nFelicidad is a businesswoman with good entrepreneurial instincts who seeks new opportunities so that she can provide her family with financial security. Now she wants to borrow 12,000 pesos for her 15th  loan cycle to use mainly as additional working capital for her ginamos business and the rest for her sea salt and coconut wine ventures.\r\n<p>\r\n<u>A little about <i>ginamos<\/i>, <i>asin<\/i> and <i>tuba<\/i>:<\/u>\r\n\"<i>Ginamos<\/i>\" is a generic Hiligaynon (the local dialect in the Western Visayas Islands) term for anything that is salted and allowed to ferment. But when referring to other salted products, it is qualified by adding the item that was salted. For example, salted duck's eggs are called <i>ginamos nga itlog<\/i>, salted fish is called <i>ginamos nga isda<\/i>, and salted mussels are called <i>ginamos nga tahong<\/i>. When the term \"<i>ginamos<\/i>\" is used alone, it usually refers to the pasty product made from minute shrimp-like crustaceans (possibly pacific krill) that are salted, dried and pounded into a paste. <i>Ginamos<\/i> is known as \"<i>bagoong<\/i>\" in Tagalog, although some of the processing steps are a bit different and the taste is also a bit different. Negrenses pride themselves on being the makers of the best <i>ginamos<\/i> in the country, and Pulupandan is one of the towns that has the tradition and recipe handed down for several generations. <i>Ginamos<\/i> is used as a flavor enhancer in a lot of Filipino dishes, but it is also a dish in itself. It is usually cooked by adding coconut vinegar and sauteed with lots of crushed garlic and a little bit of sugar to balance the saltiness. Sometimes fried pork rind is added to make it even more special. It is usually served with green mangoes or as a side dish for <i>kare-kare<\/i>, a Filipino dish made with oxtail or beef cooked in a peanut sauce with vegetables.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Asin<\/i>, or sea salt, is made by sun drying sea water on shallow flats until the liquid evaporates and salt crystals appear. Once the salt bed is dry, the salt crystals are gathered and packed into sacks for distribution. Sea salt remains the preferred flavor enhancer in many Negrense kitchens, because many cooks contend that sea salt packs a better flavor than the fine iodized table salt sold in groceries.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Tuba<\/i>, or coconut wine, is made, not from coconut water inside the coconut, but rather by \"wounding\" the unopened flower clusters and collecting the sweet sap drops into a container. The flower clusters are usually lacerated early in the morning to get the sweeter sap, and the containers are usually gathered in the afternoon just in time for the men to arrive home from work. The slightly alcoholic beverage makes a refreshing drink after a hard day in the fields. If the <i>tuba<\/i> is not consumed within the day, it is kept in glass bottles in a cool dark place to ferment into vinegar. Like balsamic vinegar, tuba vinegar improves with age. Tuba vinegar is one of the most fragrant and flavorful vinegars in the Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable.

To make a living, Lucila owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops.

Lucila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase general farm supplies & equipment. Lucila is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the 12th loan taken out by Lucila from PMPC.

There, she has a business called Tienda Aqui Me Quedo (the I'm Staying Here Store) that sells snack food, groceries, drinks, and other general items. Her entrepreneurial idea started with the help of her husband and daughter; he was unemployed and their daughter helped provide start-up capital. Through their disciplined and persistent work, they have grown the business gradually until they were able to turn it into an income stream that covers the family's daily living expenses. Their main challenge is having insufficient working capital to make cash purchases and take advantage of discounts that would increase their margins. This is why they have turned to Kiva for a loan. This first loan through Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo will be used to purchase groceries in volume as well as other miscellaneous items for their store, such as paperclips, stationary, etc. Their greatest goal is to have a freezer for storing meat products so they will be able to respond more quickly to a growing number of neighbors' daily

selling a variety of products in the local community. She has many years of experience in this business.    \r\n\r\nRasela needs a loan of WST $1,500 to purchase additional products to sell, such as tin fish, flour, sugar, salt, laundry soap and toilet rolls. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 WST or US $125 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rasela joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Rasela's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale of 1 to 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the overall social metric score.  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

N. lives in the Khuroson region.

She takes the milk to the local market and sells it to those that do not have animals of their own. She also collects milk from the local population and sells it on the market together with the milk from her own cow. However, in order to increase profit, Saodat decided to obtain a loan and purchase a second cow, which will provide her with additional milk. This will allow her to decrease prices, and will make the milk more affordable.

The official name of this borrowing group is Nguy\u1ec7t C\u1ea7u 04 (4).\n\n\nH. is married and has 3 school-aged children.

H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.704.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.048.000 VND which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.

justamente lo llev\u00f3 a tener su negocio de alquiler de lavadoras, pues desde los 15 a\u00f1os era empleado de una microempresa de esta misma actividad,  pero la propietaria de este negocio quer\u00eda invertir en mantenimiento y  se le fueron deteriorando   y para no gastar en ello, le ofreci\u00f3 el negocio a  Freddy  para trabajarlo en compa\u00f1\u00eda  , as\u00ed que el como trabajador ganaba el 50% de la venta del servicio, pero gradualmente ella se desinteres\u00f3 de este negocio y termin\u00f3  por dej\u00e1rselo a John Freddy, quien teniendo en cuenta la dificultad en el mantenimiento preventivo que se le presentaba, decidi\u00f3  aprender \u00e9l mismo a hacerlo y ahora est\u00e1 muy pendiente de sus maquinas y las cuida mucho. John Freddy tiene un ayudante y 30 lavadoras en dos ubicaciones diferentes y tambi\u00e9n tiene 2 triciclos con los que se combate, llev\u00e1ndola donde pidan el servicio.\nSu sue\u00f1o es continuar estudiando, pero  su esposa  lo est\u00e1 haciendo ahora y es necesario esperar a que est\u00e9 m\u00e1s organizado, porque tambi\u00e9n deben ambos estar pendientes de su peque\u00f1o hijo de 5 a\u00f1os. John trabaja todos los d\u00edas del a\u00f1o menos el 1\u00b0 de Enero y el viernes santos, con todo este esfuerzo tan grande,  y con la ayuda de Dios, el Tiene fe en que va a salir adelante con su familia y le pide a Dios  que le de su casa propia.\n\nEste es su sexto cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo organizaci\u00f3n que lo ha apoyado en su crecimiento como joven empresario y solicita ahora su credikiva como una oportunidad pues quiere comprar 6 lavadoras para  reemplazar las ya  muy desactualizadas  y deterioradas por el tiempo.\n\n\n","en":"John Freddy O. is a very responsible young man and that is what took him to having his own business; renting out washing machines.  From age 15 he had been an employee of a small company, doing the same thing, but the owner  wanted to invest in maintenance, as the machines were deteriorating, so rather than invest, she offered Freddy a partnership.  This allowed him to keep 50% of the profits from the service.  Over time, the owner lost interest in the business and left it to John Freddy, who, given the difficulty of the preventive maintenance, decided to learn it and now does it all himself.  He is very careful with his machines and cares for them very well.  John Freddy has one assistant and 30 machines in two different locations.  He also has two tricycles that he uses to deliver the machines to where the customers request.\r\n\r\nHe would like to continue with his education, but his wife is currently in school and he needs to wait until he is better organized, because they must also care for their five year old son.  John works every day of the year, except New Years Day and Good Friday.  With great effort, and with God\u2019s help, he has faith that he will get ahead with his family, and he asks God to grant him his own home.\r\n\r\nThis will be his sixth loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo organization, which has supported him in his growth as a young entrepreneur.  He is asking for this Kiva loan for the opportunity to buy six washing machines to replace the ones that have deteriorated over time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo

They got the idea for the business after adopting their dog Chopper in 2006 and quickly realizing that there was nowhere in town to buy the pet accessories they wanted. Rick, who had spent 18 years as a store manager for a big company, knew he had the experience necessary to open their own store to fill that gap. \u201cHaving my own business is something I\u2019ve always wanted, and I had been thinking about for years,\u201d said Rick. \r\n \r\n Rick and Alaycia have adjusted their store to the needs of the town, as well as the economy. A couple years ago they shifted their focus from pet accessories and expanded the store to include a grooming salon. The Pampered Pet Boutique has since won their city\u2019s \u201cBest of the Best\u201d award two years in a row, and the couple intends to defend their title as long as they can. \u201cWe\u2019re offering a service and want to make sure that pets are going home in the best condition possible. Regardless of how the economy is doing, people treat their pets like family,\u201d says Rick. \r\n \r\nThe Pampered Pet Boutique has over 2,000 clients, so the dryers, clippers, and tubs are always busy. Rick and Alaycia used their own money to start the business and now need capital to maintain their equipment and continue operating. But despite their success, their bank turned them away due to tight lending standards in the credit crunch. \r\n \r\nRick discovered Opportunity Fund through the City of Tracy, which was trying to help its small business owners. With a $5,000 loan they will be able to upgrade old equipment and continue to build up their credit. \u201cI had no idea that there were non-profit groups out there lending to small businesses, so I\u2019m really appreciative of this chance,\u201d Rick said.\r\n \r\nTo find out more about the The Pampered Pet Boutique, visit:

Amor wants her children to continue their studies until they get a degree for their better future.

She will use her portion of this loan to buy a new freezer for her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":671395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy a freezer for ice cream","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ita","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.483333 -57.35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-12-20T17:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zunilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Digna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"M.

She lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Rosie is borrowing PHP 15,000 to fund her business operations. This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rosie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

In her large garden she raises vegetables such as aubergine (eggplant), tomatoes, and different types of fruit like apples, peaches and plums. She and her husband are unemployed and raising vegetables and fruits is the only source to feed the family. All members of the family help Madine to plant, look after and sell in the local bazaar. Every day Madine wakes up early in the morning to prepare her kids to go to the school and to water her garden. The oldest son left school as soon as he finished 9th grade to help his parents. During the autumn selling vegetables and fruits bring Madine and her family income for the rest seasons, but it is very hard to cover all the needs of so big a family . To improve their life conditions Madine has decided to expand her business and start planting potatoes, cucumbers and peppers.

She loves selling goods, which is the business through which she makes a living. \r\n\r\nEsther has been selling crates of eggs at the community market for more than thirteen years. She treks to the surrounding villages in the Ashanti region of Ghana to purchase eggs in bulk from farmers and sells retail to her customers. Due to a lack of adequate working capital, she is not able to purchase enough stock to make a sufficient profit to support her family. She wants to use part of her profits to support her childrens' education. \r\n\r\nEsther would be grateful for your assistance with the loan.

G. es un se\u00f1or de 39 a\u00f1os de edad. Vive en una casa propia con su esposa y sus dos hijas. Su familia se ha dedicado desde hace muchos a\u00f1os a la ganader\u00eda tanto para leche como para carne. \u00c9l sigui\u00f3 los mismos pasos y actualmente tiene una finca que es la que le ayuda a salir adelante. \n\nLa comunidad en la cual vive don Juan Carlos se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de unos dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano, sin embargo varias veces al a\u00f1o, el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que caen en la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. Cuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en el Atl\u00e1ntico de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona.\n\nHace dos a\u00f1os, se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce. Por lo tanto, en los \u00faltimos dos a\u00f1os don Juan Carlos ha ido especializ\u00e1ndose en la producci\u00f3n de leche que luego vende a esta planta. \n\nDon Juan Carlos desea obtener un microcr\u00e9dito por \u00a2500.000 (quinientos mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera m\u00e1s y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche. El sabe que contar con una vaca m\u00e1s es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo pero dice que si quiere sacar su familia adelante tiene que esforzarse en producir m\u00e1s.\n\nActualmente don Juan Carlos orde\u00f1a a mano en una peque\u00f1a instalaci\u00f3n de madera que acondicion\u00f3 como sala de orde\u00f1o. Dice que por d\u00eda logra producir aproximadamente 40 litros de leche y con una vaca m\u00e1s su producci\u00f3n aumentar\u00eda a 60 litros diarios por lo cual esta muy emocionado de poder ver como su negocio crece y se fortalece.\n\nDon Juan Carlos es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la microfinanciera EDESA. Gracias a su vinculaci\u00f3n con esta organizaci\u00f3n ha obtenido ya un  microcr\u00e9dito y lo ha cancelado satisfactoriamente ayud\u00e1ndole a crecer en su negocio de producci\u00f3n de leche y sus derivados.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":405871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

T., 42, lives in the village of Brgy Doldol, Valladolid, Negros, Occidental.  She is married to Dominador T., who works as a seaman at an international liner to provide a better future for his family. They are blessed with two young elementary school age children, ages nine and 11.\r\n\r\nBefore her husband worked as a seaman, Juvy was very worried about her family's situation.  She was afraid that she would not be able to send their children to school.  She started a general store in a high pedestrian area and as her business grew, she needed additional capital to expand.  Juvy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 and with loans she was able to expansion and support her family.  She even started selling gasoline in her community, which is far from the nearest gasoline station.\r\n \r\nEven with regular income from her husband, Juvy continued to rely on NWTF-PD as her capital source so she could borrow money.   She enjoys the camaraderie with her group and center mates as well as the benefits: insurance and a savings program as well as business advice and training.\r\n\r\nBecause of their hard work and dedication, Juvy and Dominador have overcome most of their problems. The business is earning good income.  She was able to move to a more permanent structure, and they bought a truck which they hire out to other people to earn income. Her business now earns an average monthly income of PHP 20,000 which is quite enough to meet the needs of their family with some savings left over for the future educational needs of their children.\r\n\r\nPreviously she borrowed Php 19,500 for her general store and gasoline business. Her loan was fully paid without any delays and she was able to maintain her good credit record at NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Now for her 12th loan, she is borrowing the same amount to continue expanding her business and to save for future emergencies.\r\n--------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":415750,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Additonal capital for buisness expansion.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Valladolid, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juvy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":780}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":136,"local_amount":6240,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":6446.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848992},{"amount":85,"local_amount":3900,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4029.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739660},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129080},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965877},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997791}],"funded_date":"2009-11-04T04:00:58Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Allen","image":1340661}},{"id":152496,"name":"Elsa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsa has a small stall where she sells different commodities such as fruits, vegetables, meat, chicken and so on.

Wood is an important ingredient in furniture-making and she saw the opportunity to work in carpentry, a skill that she exercises, together with her spouse, in a well-equipped shop where they fulfill orders for their most important customers from the city and the region.  She is well-known among her customers for the high quality of the woods she sells and for the good customer service she offers.  With this 2000 sol loan she will buy cuartones (a beam sixteen feet long of 3\"x3\" wood) of woods like: tornillo (a tropical hardwood, also referred to as cedrorana, grows in the Loreton Huanuco provinces of Peru and in the humid terra firma of the Brazilian Amazon region), cedar, mahogany, ishpingo (a tropical wood, ishpingo can be found in the humid tropical forests growing mostly on sandy, deep and well drained soils. It is a member of the high forest vegetation group. Grows to 40 m tall.) among other varieties that are especially valued in making living-room, dining-room, kitchen and office furniture.  Charito is a very persevering and enterprising woman, qualities that serve as examples for other women who, like her, want to get ahead.  She is grateful to the Manuela Ramos Movement for contributing to the fulfillment of her dreams and to meeting her goals.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":471388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":" To buy various kinds of wood to make furniture.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"         Charito ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":241.66,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":688.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954454},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:49Z","rounded_local_amount":344.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987478},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:30Z","rounded_local_amount":344.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713497},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":344.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746563},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":344.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929768}],"funded_date":"2010-02-02T04:19:08Z","paid_date":"2010-07-27T07:49:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":173172,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is a 40-year-old married woman with five children who are in school.

He is 57 years old. Leonardo is widowed and has 2 adult-aged children. To make a living, Leonardo owns & operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Leonardo has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Leonardo joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonardo is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Leonardo from HSPFI.

Dora sells clothing for women, youth, and girls, as well as underwear and socks for men and women.

(ASHI)\u2013Rizal Central Branch. ASHI is a partner microfinance institution of Kiva in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nAnalyn is 40 years of age and married to a carpenter. They were blessed with four children. She joined ASHI way back in 2007 and utilized her loan by putting up a small store. As years passed by and because of her dedication, her business grew and her earnings from the store add to the meager income of her husband. Her earnings help pay the school expenses of their children, two of whom are already in college. \r\n\r\nBoth parents hope and dream to further expand their store business and increase the products to be sold. She is applying for a loan to buy three sacks of sugar, packs of cigarettes, cases of soft drinks, cans of cooking oil, sacks of charcoal and other grocery products. With this new capital, she will earn an additional 6,000.00 pesos on her monthly profit. This way, she can save more in preparation for the welfare of their children and for their schooling. Her children help also in managing their store. This husband and wife are thankful for ASHI and Kiva for their financial and moral support and promise to work hard to reach their dreams.

capital city of Mongolia).  The older son, Munkhbayar, is 18 and studies in a University. The younger son, Munkherdene, is 16 and studies in a College. Otgonbayar\u2019s husband Otgonbileg is a blacksmith who makes metal stoves and ovens which are used for cooking and providing warmth in gers (Mongolian traditional nomadic tents). These products are in high demand in Ulaanbaatar- statistics say that about 70% of households in Ulaanbaatar are still living in the ger district.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The husband is a carpenter and they have two children aged nine years old and three and half months old. Her business is located at Kitengela. She owns a store in which she sells fruits and vegetables. She has been in this business for the last two years. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is there are so many people doing the same kind of business as hers in the area and so customers are not loyal as they are spoilt for choice.

The group consists of eight women who know each other and are neighbors.  They are as follows:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tSra. Marcela C. V. will use her loan to buy thread and napkins to embroider and sell.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Beda V\u00e1zquez C. will buy thread, ribbons, and gift items to restock her sewing supply shop.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Ambrosia Mel\u00e9ndez Z. will buy soap, eggs, milk, sugar, and other products to stock her store.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Yolanda Mil\u00e1n R. will buy all types of candy to sell.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Alicia V\u00e1zquez Campose will buy cornmeal, cheese, cream, vegetables, and other items for preparing and selling her dishes.  \r\n\u2022\tSra. Yadira C. Mil\u00e1n will buy dyes and scissors for her beauty salon.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Mar\u00eda Luisa C. R\u00edos will buy rice, vegetables, and meats for selling food in her establishment.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Cira P. S\u00e1nchez will buy trousers, skirts, and other items to restock her business.\r\n\r\nSra. Yadira C. Mil\u00e1n is a member of this group.  She is 21 years old and obtained her diploma after completing three years of high school.  Yadira is married, pregnant, and will be having her first child very soon.  She has a beauty parlor as well as a business selling food.  The loan she is requesting will be used for both businesses.  She plans to buy liquid foundation, dyes, manicure supplies, soft drinks, meats, vegetables, condiments, and gas.  Since she is pregnant, Yadira has chosen not to work in her beauty salon at the moment because of the chemical fumes that could harm her baby.  She currently offers quick breads, snacks, sandwiches, stews, stuffed corn cakes, and soft drinks.  Her mother-in-law started this business ten years ago and left it to her so that she could vacation in the United States.  When she began working with her mother-in-law, Yadira learned how to prepare the food.  Her business is located on the outskirts of Jaloxtoc.  She lives in the central part of town, so she must take public transportation in order to get to her business.  The business is important and special to Yadira because it keeps her busy and enables her to support herself.  Her favorite part of the business is making the tortillas, the quick breads, and the snacks.  She is proud of seeing her customers enjoy the food for its flavor as well as the tortillas.  Her customers include neighbors, teachers, students, and out-of-town visitors.  The business is popular since her mother-in-law knows many people.  The challenges to her business are the dusty climate, the high cost of electricity, and competition from similar businesses.  Her business profits are reinvested in vegetables and meats.  \r\n\r\nSra. Yadira is planning to expand her business by introducing candies and pork.  She believes she will be able to save up enough money to buy the candy.  Her business has helped improve her family\u2019s quality of life and prevented them from lacking anything.  What she wants most is to build a house and have a space all to herself since she currently lives with her mother-in-law.

She then sell this clothing in a store located at \u201cMercado Campesino\u201d (farmers market) in Monterrey every Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Additionally, she sells clothing to remarketers whom buy her merchandise in greater quantities.  Actually, she has a contact who has offered her the opportunity to sell her clothing in outlets of big department stores (like JC Penney and Sears). So she needs to invest $2,305 but she only has $1,380, and for this reason Ana Maria needs a loan of $925 and 6 months to repay. She has to take advantage of this opportunity because this situation will eventually let her open a boutique with new and better quality of clothing.

He plans to repay his loan in 10 months\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Olga Espira, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0413\u0443\u043b\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432

They know one another through customary ties and have decided to work together in the framework of fully developing their income-generating businesses having a niche in firewood commerce.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter four group loans (solidarity loans), all correctly repaid, the women are on their fifth solidarity loan with Soro Yiriwaso.  They plan to buy seven tonnes of firewood from suppliers in N\u2019Tobougou.  The women sell the goods to wholesalers who come each week from Dio\u00efla to the local marketplace in N\u2019Tobougou.  With this loan, the group members each hope to generate a profit of 7,000 francs CFA that will be used to cover the cost of health care and clothing for the children. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":276355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zele ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaye ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diarra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A\u00efssa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Badiala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":105000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":17500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":38870.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033661},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":19435.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621029},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":19435.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019994},{"amount":37.51,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":19435.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242739},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":19435.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678271}],"funded_date":"2009-04-02T05:01:43Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":95012,"name":"Silvia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Silvia P.
