Having been a very persistent person, she concentrated all her efforts and achieved success. \r\n\r\nDinara managed to obtain a small shop at the local market, which had a wide assortment of women's clothes.  Her loyal customers \u2013 mostly school teachers, highly appreciate the good quality of Dinara's goods and the very attentive attitude of the shopkeeper to every client. \r\n\r\nIn June 2010, when violent clashes caused by the deposed political regime broke out in the city of Osh, Dinara lost her business. Her shop was robbed and looted. \r\n\r\nHowever, Dinara isn't giving up and is ready to resume her lost business and continue to work. For this very reason, Dinara is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her activity. She plans to purchase more women\u2019s clothes to resell at the local market. Dinara believes that her favorite city Osh will certainly rise from the ashes and become a prosperous one. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

Canmoros, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a business venture: a General Store business. \r\n\r\nIlluminada joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1992 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Illuminada has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use to buy raw materials for her home repairs and stocks for the general store so that she could continue to save up for future improvement of business.  Illuminada J. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

(Powerful Women 1 & 2). This group is located in Puerto Plata, a rural port town on the north coast where the economy is based on tourism. Most of the group members sell products in this area.  Evangelista is a single mother and her home is a simple structure that she shares with her three children. Her most difficult challenge is to begin her new cafeteria business. Evangelista says that her business efforts will make it possible to provide for her family. In the meantime, she plans to continue to enjoy attending and participating in church and doing business.\r\n\r\nEvangelista will use her portion of this group loan to invest in her butcher shop and she is planning to buy a cow to butcher and sell. She also sells boiled beans that neighborhood people buy to cook them faster at home. She began her business by selling these boiled beans and after she saved enough money she began buying meat such as chicken, beef, and pork, to start a butcher shop.

taro. She offers her harvested taro for sale to local community members. She has four years of experience in this business. She lives with her husband and two children in Manono, Samoa. \r\n\r\nFilomena needs a loan of WST $2,500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 800 talas or US $333 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n \r\nIn 2009, Filomena joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Filomena's fourth loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

The drug store is located in the center of the town, which allows him to have many clients and customers. Bahodur has been a client of IMON for a year. Now he requests 4000 Somoni.

Your generosity can change their lives.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

K. is a 43-year-old woman living in the town of Fagalii-Uta.  She is married and has 4 school-aged children.  To make a living, Faete runs a general store.  The primary source of income for this business comes selling a variety of different products to the local community.  Faete has been engaged in this business for over 3 years.\r\n\r\nFaete joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve both her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  Faete has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1750 Samoan tala (or about $725 US) from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to renovate her general store.  Faete is now requesting a new loan of 2500 tala (or about $950) which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 4th loan Faete has taken out from SPBD.  Faete plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her store.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Most of the group has worked with this type of loan; some of them are long time members.  Generally, they all sell things like bread, empanadas, groceries, food, cosmetics, pastries, or make cakes to order.  There is a lot of competition in the commercial area, but they all have good products to sell and they know how to do their work.  Therefore, they do not have major problems with the competition.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to support them in their small businesses.  They will buy supplies for their businesses like flour and shortening.  They will buy tools like utensils for making and decorating cakes.  They will do this to expand their businesses and generate greater earnings.  This will help them to improve the quality of life for their families.\r\n\r\nAs far as experience goes, the members do not have experience with unified loans, but they are very enthusiastic to have the confidence of an institution that helps and believes that they can get ahead in their small businesses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

The main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting corn for sale. She has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Erminda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from GDMPC, which was used to  purchase additional seeds to plant. She is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be Erminda\u2019s fifth loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the her family\u2019s general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Teresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ma. Teresa M. lives in the village of Brgy Vito, Sagay, Negros Occidental. She is 46 years old, and married to Renato M. who is a fisherman and the father of her two children. The children are 10 and 12 years old, and both are attending school. Teresa dreams of uplifting their living and being  able to send their two children to school and get a college degree so that they will have better opportunities for a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nFrom the time she got married, Teresa was the one who sold his catch to members of their community and sometimes even in the public market. Sometimes they get lucky and the customers are the ones who approach them to buy her husband's catch of the day. Teresa and her husband own their fishing boat, but in 1997, they needed money to do some major repair to their boat. This motivated her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could access the necessary capital to fund their fishing operations. As she paid off each loan, she was able to borrow more funds to further improve their fishing business, buying new nets and other fishing gear. Now she is able to earn a net profit of PHP 10,000 per month from their fishing operations. She saves most of her profits for the education of her family, taking out only the most necessary funds to support their household expenses.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, she borrowed Php 19,500 that she used as additional capital or revolving working fund for her fishing business. The loan was fully paid within her loan term without any delays in any of the weekly installments. Now for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing the same amount of Php 19,500 to be used for the repair of her fishing boat.

Zenith makes freshly squeezed juices in addition to food which brings her extra income.  She gained experience in the business four years ago from her sister, who also sells food.  Zenith started selling in a neighborhood where she used to live and now she is fully in charge of her home and taking care of her three children.  This is her first loan with \"Foundation Mario Santo Domingo\" and she will buy ingredients for food preparation as well as two table sets with chairs because she sells to her clients in her terrace, but when it gets busy she has to use her family dining room.  Her dream is to set up a restaurant in the terrace with tents for the liking and comfort of her clients to enjoy her food.  Her business has high impact in her life because it generates profit between 46%-47% which strengthens her autonomy and has allowed her to live comfortably in her own house where she covers the family expenses.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":729179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has four years of experience in this business. Marata needs a loan of WST $2,000 to purchase additional fabrics and materials. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve and expand the business. She and her husband have four children.\r\n \r\nIn 2007, Marata joined SPBD* in order to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Marata's fifth loan with SPBD. \r\n \r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on

48 -year-old Oscar from Krootown, central area in Freetown, Sierra Leone. She is married with 3 children between the ages of 17 years and 24 years. She has 6 additional dependents that live with her at home.  In 1996, Oscar established her building materials store in Krootown. She began her business because she was working as a secretary, but the salary she was receiving was insufficient for her to support her family. She works at the business from Monday until Sunday, 7 days per week and 12 hours a day from 7:00am -7:00pm. She also earns income from another business selling pork. She says that the main challenge to her business is high cost of transportation.\r\n\r\nOscar requires a loan in order to purchase more building materials such as switches, plugs, pump heads, nails, sinks, and wash hand basins. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to secure more goods for the store. In the future, Oscar plans to have a bigger building materials store in the country. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":936231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede they have no money left to pay laborers who are indispensible to them in cultivating the land they own.  <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Daniel A. has requested a loan of 100,000 F CFA which will allow him to farm about 1 hectare, growing the aforementioned crops.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":237830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"farming of 1 hectare, in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T16:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821551},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357817},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046867},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938485},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396151},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25800.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904028},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126036}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T20:10:36Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83127,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary S. is 32 years old, married, with 4 children, all of whom are in school.

This is 46-year-old Angelina W. M. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with one child who is 18 years old. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because their parents can not take care of them. Angelina has been running a butcher shop business since 2008. Her business is to buy the cows and butcher them. She works at the business for five hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by two employees and her husband. Angelina currently earns about 200USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to buy a cow. In the future, she plans to open another business. Angelina thanks you for your support!\r\n\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

She discovered the world of photography while a college student in San Jose, California: \u201cRight away, I knew photography was absolutely my passion, my talent, and my greatest ambition.\u201d As a Saudi Arabian woman attending a predominantly Latino university, her love for photography grew alongside her love for Latino culture. She was struck by the many similarities between Latino families and Saudi families: love of family, food, ritual, and celebration.\n \nAfter graduating from college, Tasneem pursued a career in photography. In 2008 she opened her own photo studio, Foto Clara, and quickly developed a client base within the Latino community she had connected with as a student. \u201cA lot of photographers miss the point of taking family pictures. They work too much with Photoshop and lose what it is that\u2019s special about the family.\u201d\n\nWhile Tasneem\u2019s portfolio of work continues to grow, she still runs her business out of her apartment, relying on her trusty old camera and a temperamental computer. In need of a loan, Tasneem approached her own bank but was turned down because she only began a credit history when she came to the U.S. for college. A $6,000 loan will allow Tasneem to purchase a new camera, a new laptop computer, and new photo editing and business accounting software. \u201cI see so much potential to grow a business here,

Olmos, ubicado una hora y media al norte de Chiclayo.\n\nDesde hace dos a\u00f1os es propietaria de un peque\u00f1o negocio que brinda servicio de fotocopias, tipeos en computadora, impresiones y venta de art\u00edculos escolares. Su establecimiento se encuentra ubicado frente a un colegio estatal del distrito por lo que resulta de mucha ayuda a los estudiantes de la zona. Con el dinero que percibe de este negocio ayuda al sostenimiento de su hogar.\n\nLa constante demanda de los estudiantes por su servicio hace que constante mente tenga que renovar el material que necesita para trabajar con los tipeos, copias e impresiones (hojas bond, tinta, toner, etc). Comprar estos productos por unidad le resulta muy caro y poco rentable para su negocio, por lo que se encuentra solicitando por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 700 nuevos soles para invertirlos en la compra al por mayor de estos productos y de esa manera tener un stock permanente con el cual pueda seguir trabajando.\n\nSu sue\u00f1o es estudiar la carrera de psicolog\u00eda en una universidad de la regi\u00f3n y brindar este servicio en su distrito. Ella es una joven trabajadora, alegre y responsable.\n","en":"Deysi is 18 years old, single, and lives with her parents in the Olmos district, located an hour and a half north of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nFor two years, she has had a small shop that offers photocopying, typing, and printing services and sells school supplies. Her business is located across from a high school, which means there are many students nearby. The money from her business helps to sustain her household.\r\n<p>\r\nThe great number of students that frequent her shop means that she constantly needs to replenish the supplies needed for her photocopying, typing, and printing services (bond paper, ink, toner, etc.). Buying these items individually is very expensive and not lucrative for her business, so Deysi is seeking her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa. She will invest the 700 Peruvian nuevos soles requested in the purchase of wholesale items, and in this way she will be able to maintain a permanent stock of products for her business. \r\n<p>\r\nDeysi's dream is to study at a local university to become a psychologist and to bring this service to her district. She is a hardworking, happy, and responsible young woman.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kris Vickery, Kiva

Veronika needs a loan of WST $3000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Veronika joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Veronika's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Veronika L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

Like many little boys dream, Tony wanted to be a race car driver. Instead, he joined the military to defend his country and pursued a career in aviation. Tony was a crew chief in the Air Force for four years. He took advantage of all the Air Force had to offer and teach him. Now a veteran of aviation, he currently works as a helicopter inspector. With the support of his wife and family, he decided to also pursue his dream of being the first African-American supercar manufacturer.\r\n\r\nWhen Tony\u2019s 6\u2019 6\u201d body could not fit in the traditional supercars, he built his own in 1990. Tony says, \u201cIf one door closes I just look for another opening; I don\u2019t give up.\u201d  With much patience and hard work he continues to expand his business and hopes to make it a full-time job. With his ACCION USA microloan he has hired two designers to work with him part-time and has purchased a laptop. He is proud to set an example of entrepreneurship for his four children and is determined to continue fulfilling his vision.\r\n\r\n<b>About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<\/b>\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the new caf\u00e9 on your corner and the delivery service that brings the fresh baked goods acquired the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. \r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

Pandan, Bogo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: General (Sari-sari) store and Tricycle business. Her husband Artemio P., who is 51 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 5 children who are 15 to 25 years old. Rowena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rowena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stocks for the general store so that she could continue to save up for the education of her children. Rowena P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Nigora is 29 years old. She is divorced and has no children. Nigora has a tailoring business at a tailoring shop. Her business is sewing national women's dresses. Her workmanship is very good and, being young, she has a good eye for design.\r\n\r\nShe is very organized and has a good head for business. She has had this business for 12 years and this is her second loan from IMON International. With her loan, Nigora will buy more material for sewing dresses.\r\n\r\nNigora smiles when asked what her dreams are for the future. She quickly replies that she plans to open a workshop, hire seamstresses and expand her business. With her spirit, she will surely succeed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

A. is a 28-year old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: motorcycle transport (habal-habal) and rice dealing businesses. She lives in Purok 4, Brgy. Bongalonan, Basay, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her motorcycle transport (habal-habal) and rice dealing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 6,500 PHP. Jocelyn is now borrowing 15,000 PHP so that she can continue to fund the operations of her motorcycle transport business. This will be her fourth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 5,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jocelyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has run her pig farm for a while, however high cost for feeds and piglets makes it impossible for her to expand her business.  She understands that pig farm can be promising financially.  The profit from the difference of selling revenue and daily cost and additional revenue stream from selling excrement as fertilizer is quite promising.  This increases her motivation to expand her farm and increase her pigs.  With additinal funding and training from DINARI, Ni Made S. can add 2 more pigs to her farm so she can have 3 pigs at a time. Piglets costs her $33 each and feeds supply for 4 months costs her $55,so she can earn $100 per 4 month periods.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is 42-year-old Justina M. from Mwanza. She is married with seven children between the ages of 15 and 24.\n\nJustina has been running a shop since 2003. She sells tea, Blands, sugar, soap and cooking oil. She works at the business for twelve hours per day, six days per week and currently earns about $198 from her business.\n\nJustina is requesting a loan of $250in order to purchase soap, cooking oil, sugar and wheat flour. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Justina thanks you for your support!\n\n\nABOUT SELFINA: \nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":318029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase soap, cooking oil, sugar and wheat flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-13T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010846},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233132},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664923},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105635},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:40Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022745},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867985},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757186},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146298},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984460}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T03:37:55Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":111815,"name":"Florenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florenda T. is from the city of Dapitan City.

Jantianon, Amlan, Negros Oriental. She earns her living with her general store and pig fattening.\r\n\r\nMerly's 38 year-old husband, Allan, is a driver and they have three children who are between 13-16 years old. The children go to school and also help their parents in the businesses as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nMerly joined Kiva partner NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income through a general store and a pig fattening business. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 25,500 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nMerly is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 30,000 was used to fund the operations of her general store and the pig fattening business.  The loan had a positive impact for both the businesses and the family living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 13th cycle loan in the amount of Php 29,500 which she plans to use for both businesses. Merly is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":542309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

For four years she has run a general store and book store from her home.  This business gives her a great deal of satisfaction since it is the main source of income for her family.  Since the beginning, she tried to see that the store was well-stocked.  She acquires at wholesale stationery supplies and adornments and articles for the home.  Sometimes she doesn't have the product a customer wants, and she loses the customer; therefore, she wishes to add to her inventory with this loan.  In the future, she wants to improve her store by installing a roof and by offering a wider variety of food and other items, so that her customers can buy what they need.  This is her tenth loan from MFP.  She promises to make timely payments because she is very responsible and because she doesn't want to disappoint her work group, which has placed much faith in her.  With this loan, she plans on purchasing a greater quantity of school supplies for this year.  Classes have already begun, and she needs to stock up on this merchandise.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeff Schell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":585040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy school supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-18T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":152.91},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":157.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":163.86},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":169.02},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":175.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":181.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.99},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.44},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.39},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.85},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.34,"local_amount":152.91,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":160.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887498},{"amount":58.99,"local_amount":157.29,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":165.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154500},{"amount":61.44,"local_amount":163.86,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":172.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449810},{"amount":63.39,"local_amount":169.02,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":177.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588507},{"amount":65.85,"local_amount":175.61,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":184.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725016},{"amount":67.99,"local_amount":181.31,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":190.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463101}],"funded_date":"2010-08-18T23:25:37Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Schell","image":null}},{"id":227386,"name":"Nhan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nhan T.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Kanoti and two other promoters in his community - Francis and Lucia - need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Kanoti wants to be a promoter because he believes that the chlorine dispenser will make water safe for use.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

She's looking for a loan from Ceprodel to get the money she needs to cover the debt and gain the benefits of being able to light her house at night.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nEl trabajo de agricultura requiere de mucho esfuerzo  por la exposici\u00f3n al sol y el desgaste f\u00edsico que este trabajo provoca.

Para suplir esta necesidad, solicita que le implementen un panel solar en su hogar y al obtenerlo se ve en la obligaci\u00f3n de pagar este panel.

B. lives in the region of Rudaki. He is 34 years old, married and has 2 children. Sheraly graduated from high school; he does not work anywhere. The only source of income for his family is an animal rearing business, which works out well in the rural area. Sheraly has a small cow barn where he grows calfs for sale. He purchases young animals on local markets, takes care of them for about 40-45 days, when animals get bigger he sells them on the same markets. Now is the season of animal trading, therefore the client needs additional help. He needs additional money, and this is why he came to us in order to obtain a loan. Additional resources will help him not only to purchase more animals, but also to receive profit, which he needs. This will help his family to have a little bit of a better life. The client plans to repay the loan within 12 months. <p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva volunteer.<b><p>\u0411\u043e\u0431\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043b\u043e\u0432

Enterprising Women.  They are from the La Conquista settlement within the La Lomita neighborhood. <p>\r\n\r\nThese women, along with the other ladies who make up the group, comprise part of a faction of people denominated as \u201cwithout roofs\u201d.  These people have nowhere to live (neither a house or land) and, together with hundreds of other people in the same situation, joined together to fight for their rights.  Today, they live in a settlement which they created a year ago which the government subsequently bought to be able to build them homes so they could live there legally. <p>\r\n\r\nIn this settlement live several families looking to get ahead.  The women play an important role since, in many cases, they are the head of household.  It\u2019s in this way that 15 women from the settlement gathered together to form the group called La Esperanza (which means \u201chope\u201d).  They carry out a variety of activities:  the sale of garlic, medicinal herbs, food sales, some have stores, others sell blankets, sheets, clothing, toys, housewares, cleaning products, etc. <p>\r\n\r\nGiven that the settlement is in a remote area, they must travel to get to the nearest clinics.  It\u2019s for this reason that Marta decided to take courses in medicine and it is she who gives injections, takes blood pressure readings and provides immediate medical care for those who need it. <p>\r\n\r\nIt is a very unified group and the women, in addition to dedicating themselves to their particular activities, also carry out extra tasks to earn more funds to help improve the neighborhood. <p>\r\n\r\nToday they need a loan to invest in their businesses, especially to buy merchandise to offer for sale.   <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEste Comit\u00e9 se formo gracias a la se\u00f1oras Lucia G. y Marta Dom\u00ednguez, quienes llamaron a la fundaci\u00f3n interesadas en el programa Comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendedoras, ellas son del Asentamiento \u201cLa Conquista\u201d del  Barrio \u201cLa Lomita\u201d.<p>\r\n\r\nEstas se\u00f1oras, al igual que las dem\u00e1s mujeres que comprende este comit\u00e9, forman parte de un grupo de gente denominado \u201csin techo\u201d. Estas personas no pose\u00edan un lugar (ni casa ni tierra) donde vivir, y que unidos entre cientos de personas en igual situaci\u00f3n, lucharon por su derecho y hoy d\u00eda viven en un asentamiento que tomaron juntos el a\u00f1o pasado y que posteriormente el estado adquiri\u00f3 compro para poder construirles casas para que vivan ah\u00ed de forma legal.<p>\r\n\r\nEn ese asentamientos existen varias familias que tambi\u00e9n buscan su progreso, las mujeres cumplen roles importantes pues son, en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, cabeza de familia. Es as\u00ed como 15 mujeres de este asentamiento se unieron y formaron un comit\u00e9 que llamado \u201cLa Esperanza\u201d. Ellas realizan distintos tipos de actividades entre ellas: venta de ajo, hierbas medicinales, venta de comidas, otras tienen despensas, otras poseen mercer\u00edas en donde venden colchas, sabanas, ropas, juguetes, art\u00edculos para el hogar, productos de limpieza, etc.<p>\r\n\r\nDebido que el asentamiento queda en un lugar retirado, ellas deben viajar hasta los puestos de salud m\u00e1s cercanos, es por eso que Marta, decidi\u00f3 hacer cursos de enfermer\u00eda y ella es quien aplica inyecciones, hace nebulizaciones para ni\u00f1os, toma de presi\u00f3n y primeros auxilios para todas las personas que necesiten.<p>\r\n\r\nEs un grupo muy unido, ellas adem\u00e1s de dedicarse a sus actividades particulares, tambi\u00e9n realizan actividades extras con el fin de obtener fondos para realizar mejoras en el barrio.<p>\r\n\r\nHoy ellas necesitan de un cr\u00e9dito que podr\u00e1n invertirlo en sus negocios, especialmente comprando mercader\u00edas para vender.<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":186165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of clothing such as socks, gloves, hats, scarves, etc.  Those who sell food, to purchase items such as fruits and vegetables, dairy products, meats, flour, oil, noodles and frozen items.

She says prices of commodities have increased and for that reason she is not able to buy more stock from the market, making it difficult to make profit to expand the business. She buys her stock of goods from the city center of Accra and retails them at the community market where she lives. <P>\r\n\r\nEvelyn is requesting a loan to augment her working capital to buy more stocks of aluminum buckets and plastic materials to sell.

She is 29 years old, married to Mr. Yoshihiro T. of Japan (a government employee), and blessed with one infant-aged child. She is a resident of P1 Garang, Tangub City. Even though she received a monthly allowance from her husband, Arlyn still had a passion for business. At present, she has a sari-sari store with an average net income of 1,500 PHP per month, and has two single-seat motorcabs for hire that bring in an average income of 240 PHP daily. These earnings are so helpful in supporting her family. Arlyn joined Kiva partner, PMPC, in 2009. She was given the privilege of borrowing 25,000 PHP as her first loan, which was used to purchase a single motorcab for hire. This time, she is requesting a loan of 12,000 PHP to add to her capital for her sari-sari store. The future income from this loan will be used to make her loan repayments and also as savings for future use. She is hoping that someday her business will become more progressive.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About PMPC<\/b><br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She owns a business venture, providing suit-making services and doing 'elei' prinitng (on cloth) for local community members.  Makerita  has many years of experience in this business.  Makerita  needs a loan of WST 1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials & some paints for making the 'elei'.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Makerita  joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Makerita's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

In the urban setting, eggs are a protein food that is very affordable for the majority of people in the community, and for this reason he believes that it is a profitable business.\r\n\r\nHis main aim in the future is to grow his business and have a better standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":609857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more eggs to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Narok","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 36.866667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2010-09-30T02:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacob Saulo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177439549},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":3333.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3369.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182578845},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3332.99,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188714081},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191452479},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195874600},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201315694},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206184945},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-18T07:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211698384},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.36,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-17T08:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216787938}],"funded_date":"2010-09-30T18:27:57Z","paid_date":"2011-07-17T08:00:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":239699,"name":"Rolando","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rolando L. is from the village of Brgy.

The most difficult have been the problem of paying for her house rent and building a house of her own.  She plans to invest this loan in frying akra beans, gateau, sales of row food stuff, purchase of sugar, palm oil, groundnut oil, salt, flour and some plates. She believes the business will succeed because she has been in the business for a long time. She also thinks her approach to her customers will be captivating and hence lead to the success of her business. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford at least three meals per day at affordable prices.\r\n\r\nAlice will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her house rent and save for rainy days. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

She is 36 years old. Mary Jane is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Mary Jane owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling canned goods, junk foods, breads, biscuits, shampoo, soap & beverages in the local community. Mary Jane has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Mary Jane joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mary Jane has successfully repaid a previous loan of 17,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Mary Jane is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods, junk foods & beverages. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Mary Jane from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.
