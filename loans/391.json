He has been able to support his family by learning how to manage his crops in the short growing season. To illustrate, he grows crops such as wheat, onions, potatoes, tomatoes, and cucumbers.  Each year his yield is sufficient to meet his family's consumption needs and to sell crops for a profit. The business is the main source of his family's income, yet generating a stable income requires considerable funding. <p>\r\nThus, now Ruziboy would like to purchase mineral fertilizers and seeds for planting, so he is seeking a loan in the amount of $1,000 over a 6-month term. With the loan proceeds, Ruziboy would buy supplies for the harvest and to improve production so that he can increase the quality of his yield and his earnings in turn. After making a good profit from his business, he is planning to send his younger son to the University because he recently finished school. With your help, this will be possible, so he thanks everyone for supporting him and promises to repay the loan on time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":176912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To increase and improve his crop yield by purchasing additional seeds and mineral fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2008-07-14T00:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruziboy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-30T02:52:54Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2008-08-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":298183},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2008-09-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-17T07:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":328767},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2008-10-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-17T07:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":362713},{"amount":332.35,"local_amount":332.35,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":332.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9943351},{"amount":166.65,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":166.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10220437}],"funded_date":"2008-07-16T02:52:54Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T13:13:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":58969,"name":"Martha's Mercy Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martha C. is 25  years old.

She really likes working with her Community Bank, Estrella Azul, because all of them are good friends.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money she is asking for to buy a greater quantity of clothes for the winter season.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":357638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-24T03:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenayda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":379.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641628},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:46Z","rounded_local_amount":379.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081068},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":379.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997218},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":379.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842562},{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1517.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734138}],"funded_date":"2009-07-24T15:41:24Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":128625,"name":"Kukapakia Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Belekai never went to school and is a widow with six children who are all high school graduates.

She has raised and sold chickens for consumption since 2007.  She buys lots of 100 one-day-old hatchlings from a distributor in the city of lima and she raises them until they are 45 days old.  At that point, she distributes them among establishments that sell chicken meat in the city's market and in a few stores near her home.  The demand for her chickens has grown because she feeds them nutritionally balanced feed in very good conditions.  Libbne is thinking of buying a new lot of 150 chicks in order to enlarge her business but she lacks sufficient funds to do so.  For this reason, she is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a 1000 new sol loan.

He lives with his wife who supports him in everything. For five years, he has been dedicated to agriculture, cultivating yucca and citrus fruits in the four hectares of land that he owns. However, while he awaits harvest season, he raises hens which he feeds adequately so that when he sells them they are the right weight and are valued at a good price.\r\n\r\nFor these activities, he counts on the support of his children and his wife who take advantage of spaces of land on his farm to sow some bread products for their daily consumption.\r\n\r\nWhat Fredy likes about his job is keeping active and teaching his family what he's learning about farming. At the same time, it is very profitable because he has a consistent buyer for his yucca and citrus produce and respect for his hens. His earnings are good when he sells them.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP and what he likes about his community bank is that all the people are trustworthy and, above all, very responsible with their payments. With the money he is requesting, he will buy more yucca plants to continue planting (with 200 soles) and with the rest, he will buy fertilizer to strengthen his land so that his crops grow strong and healthy.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":447723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase yucca plants and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-13T21:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fredy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672724}],"funded_date":"2009-12-13T21:50:00Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":165768,"name":"Santa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Santa L. is currently in the business of selling beans and peas in the market and is requesting a loan to purchase bags of rice and corn meal to sell.

","en":"Mrs. Consuelo V. V., 47, is married and has three children.  She has worked making typical sweets for 12 years with her husband and children that help her make cocadas (coconut bars), higos (candied figs), camotes (candied sweet potatoes) and other varieties.\r\n\r\nConsuelo used to not make much, just enough to stock her stand in Antigua\u2019s market.  Because of lack of capital she was only able to make the bare minimum variety.  Because many people sought her out, however, she decided to solicit a loan from a Communal Bank although it was difficult for her because she wasn\u2019t used to having debts.  However, facing the need to help her business grow she asked for 5000 quetzals and, thanks to God, earned good profits and became better known still for her delicious, fresh sweets.  She currently supplies sweets to Antigua\u2019s best known hotels.\r\n\r\nNow that her doors are open she wants to invest more so that the business will grow.  Her dream is to buy a large locale where she can work because she is currently working at home and this had caused problems in that the sweets she makes attract a lot of bees and this annoys her neighbors.  She also wants her children to get ahead and attend the university so that they can become professionals and have good jobs later on.  For these reasons she has called upon Fape to request a loan so that she can reach her goals.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":610748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To make typical sweets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Jocotenango Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Consuelo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":9500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":527.74},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":240105,"name":"December 8 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Para la formaci\u00f3n el presente comit\u00e9 inicio la se\u00f1ora Doralicia Ben\u00edtez quien est\u00e1 domiciliadla en el Barrio San Roque de C.D.E.

Amongst her steady clients are three schools, some kindergartens and individual clients. During the year she works alone, but in January and February she hires another person to help her because she receives many orders from schools at this time of year. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she will purchase an industrial sewing machine. This is what she needs right now, even though she has four other sewing machines, which she uses for other work. Her goal is to continue expanding her business and increase both her workshop space and her client base.\r\n\r\nAdriana is very grateful for the help from Fondo Esperanza, both for the loans they provide her and for the workshops, which they run regarding business administration. The workshop that has helped her the most up until now was the workshop that taught her how to record her expenditures and income in an accounts book, which has helped her to better organize both her time and her money.\r\n\r\nVi\u00f1a del Mar is both a city and a commune located in the region of Valpara\u00edso on the central coast of Chile. It is known as the Garden City because of its beautiful places and courtyards and is considered to be the tourist capital of Chile. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":639030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Industrial sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Vi\u00f1a del Mar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":413612,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":31718},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":32516},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":32939},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":33368},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33802},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":34243},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":34688},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":35140},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":35598},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36061},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":36531},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":37008}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.68},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.59},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.51},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.44},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.38},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.31},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.29},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":205.57,"local_amount":97173,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":98776.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188679453},{"amount":142.1,"local_amount":67170,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":68278.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191420887},{"amount":145.82,"local_amount":68931,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":70068.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195839713},{"amount":149.65,"local_amount":70738,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":71905.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201282207},{"amount":153.57,"local_amount":72592,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":73789.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206150217},{"amount":78.29,"local_amount":37008,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":37618.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211223311}],"funded_date":"2010-12-02T02:29:48Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":252400,"name":"Jeffren Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El joven Jeffren Antonio tiene 25 a\u00f1os, es casado El se dedica a la venta y reparaci\u00f3n de celulares.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, contains epic mountain passes, and is a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

San Rafael is a rural community where most people raise livestock for milk and meat.  It has a warm climate and is very popular with tourists who come to see the Arenal volcano, the clear blue rivers, hot springs, lakes, mountains and the natural beauty of the region.  Pineapple, cassava, oranges and beans are some of the crops grown in the surrounding agricultural areas.\r\n\r\nSilvia is married to Carlos Garc\u00eda and they have a two-month-old daughter named Jimena.  Silvia and Carlos work together on a 12-hectare farm which they rent; this is also where their home is.  They have been raising livestock on this farm for two years.  Her family has a long tradition of raising livestock as both her father and grandfather were in the livestock business.  Silvia is also working hard to finish her university degree which she pays for with the revenues from farming.\r\n\r\nBecause she wants to increase her income to improve her quality of life and be able to continue studying, Silvia needs a microloan of USD $1,000.

She plans to sell the cattle at one of the many local auctions.\r\n\r\nSilvia is part of the Florencia community bank, one of the more than 100 member organisations of EDESA in Costa Rica.

Maria Luz has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maria Luz joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maria Luz has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from GDMPC. She used her previous loan to purchase new equipment and tools to expand her business. Maria Luz is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP to buy more firewood to sell. This will be Maria Luz's second loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Vista Alegre, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  carpentry, buying and selling charcoal and selling chicken. She has three children who are 2 to 7 years old. Maricel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maricel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to purchase more materials for her carpentry business so that she can continue to save up for her children's education. Maricel C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team at Kiva.org.

They have 2 children: Jesus, 8, and a beautiful baby daughter, only recently born.  They live in a house they own in the town of Sanchirio (in a forested region of central Peru).  Rodrigo has operated a farming business for 6 years.  He grows coffee, maize and yucca.  After much work, he sells his coffee crop to a local cooperative that stores the coffee and exports it all over the world.  They just started exporting coffee to France and they hope to expand their sales to other countries in the near future.  He takes his other crops--maize and yucca--to the market in the city of La Merced, a trip he makes every 15 days.  In the future, Rodrigo would like to buy more land to grow more coffee.

She opened a breakfast restaurant, while still selling fruit.  Her business has grown since.  She is now able to buy other furniture in the house and provide her children with a good education.  This time Mrs. H. would like to borrow 19,000,000 VND (approximately 1150 USD) to buy more fruit and food, in order to provide better service to her customers.\r\nOn average, her family income is 6,000,000 VND (i.e., 375 USD) per month.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb H\u01b0ng n\u0103m nay 36 tu\u1ed5i,  gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb hi\u1ec7n c\u00f3 3 con \u0111ang tu\u1ed5i \u0111i h\u1ecdc.

They are all in different lines of work; specifically clothing, underwear and toy sales in the market.\r\n\r\nGabriela is communal bank President.  In the photo she\u2019s in the middle of the group and is wearing a white blouse and black vest; the other group members are pointing at her.  She has been selling used clothes and toys in the market for the last two years.  She works every weekend in the market and sporadically cares for two senior citizens in a private home.  She buys her merchandise in various places, whichever is the most economically convenient.  She intends to use this loan to buy a bundle of clothes (a large package of used clothes).\r\n\r\nHer goal for her business is to get a large awning to use as protection during the winter because of the rain and in summer because of the intense heat because currently Gabriela arranges her wares on a piece of cloth in the street.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her 26-year-old daughter who helps her on weekends with the clothing sales.  Her personal dreams are to become economically independent and to get a locale of her own to work in.\r\n\r\nGabriela is very grateful for the loan granted by Fondo Esperanza because it will make it possible for her to invest in her business.  Besides, she feels very comfortable in the group of entrepreneurs because they are neighbors and known to her.  Because of this, the meetings are very pleasant and they support each other quite a bit.   With respect to the workshops conducted, Gabriela has learned how to better distribute income earned from her business.\r\n\r\nValpara\u00edso is located 120 kilometers northeast of Santiago.  It is the regional capital and also the legislative seat of the country.  It is the country\u2019s main port and offers a large variety of beautiful, picturesque places like, for example, Nobel Prize winning poet Pablo Neruda\u2019s house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":737611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Since childhood he has been interested in animal husbandry. His grandfather and father were in the business. From them, he studied and learned all of the finer points of the business. He has been in business for more than forty years, and thus has extensive experience.  He travels to distant villages to buy their stock, and then sells it at the local market. This business is the sole source of income for his family, and he wants to expand this business to maximize his profit.

She has a daughter, who is 2 years old. There, since 2007, she has sold a variety of merchandise such as perfumes, clothing, and cosmetics through orders placed from catalogs or at exhibits. She sells on credit, with agreements with her customers for payments in two weeks. Her customers include employees, police staff, relatives, neighbors, friends, and people referred to her, who increase every day. When she ventured to begin this business which would generate income for her, she was supported by a relative who lent her money. This was how she started up an important business to sell her products through catalogs, as she has done up to this date,  but now she also buys in the commercial zone of Barranquilla from other merchants whose catalog she doesn't have. With her business, she has succeeded in attracting a growing customer base and in buying a display case to exhibit her merchandise in the house of her mother, with whom she lives, along with her brother and her little daughter, whom she dreams of raising to be a successful professional and is the main motivation for her life. Her dream and great challenge is to have a well-located store specializing in cosmetic lines and clothing. With her Kiva loan, her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, she will have additional capital to buy clothing and cosmetics for which she has orders, and she wants to do this in a timely manner so that she does not lose customers. Her investment will be successful since she still has orders from her most profitable clients and she will be prepared with her Kiva loan for the seasons in which sales rise, such as the month of love

She\u2019s been in this business for six years now and it's allowed her to prosper and get ahead.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that it allows her to manage her own time.  Although at first she faced many problems, among them not knowing the entire process or not knowing that she had to apply certain vaccinations to each chick, now she is quite expert and every day her care of these animals improves.\r\n\r\nThis will be MFP loan #14.

Tabao, Zone 2, Valladolid, Negros Occidental, in the Philippines.  \r\n\r\nThey started off in this business without owning a fishing boat, even a small one, as they had no money to purchase one.  Their recourse then was to hitch a ride with other fishermen in their boats, fish and sell the fish to the local community. However, with a lot of hard work and a desire to improve not only their quality of life but also the education of their three children, Amera joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 and slowly they were able to improve their business. They were able to buy their own fishing boat, purchase more nets, venture into catching crabs, and now they are able to sell these not only in the local community but also to businessmen, who sell their crabs and some fish in the big cities, getting them more margin on their catch.\r\n\r\nNow on her 13th loan cycle with NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amera earns between P6-16,000 a month from the business, which helps a lot in providing for their household expenses and sending her three children to school, and even allowing them to expand their fishing business. For her next loan, Amera needs P19,500 to purchase materials to build more nets to catch bigger crabs. At the same time she will use some of the money for additional working capital for the business, which will allow them to increase their catch and hopefully, save more money in the hopes of adding a few fishing boats to their fleet in the near future.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life which can be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":415899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To make more nets and provide additional working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Valladolid, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T12:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":780}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":136,"local_amount":6240,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":6447.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848996},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739664},{"amount":85,"local_amount":3900,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4029.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129084},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:54:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965881},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997795}],"funded_date":"2009-11-03T06:20:33Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rose Vines","image":111942}},{"id":153413,"name":"Militina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la se\u00f1ora Militina D.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her food stall, general store and ready-to-wear clothes businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 20,000.  \r\n\r\nAnecia is now borrowing PHP 18,000 so that she can buy rice and spices for her eatery and stocks for the general store. This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nAnecia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Having her own business, her husband's sporadic income being a farm laborer will be augmented to be able to meet the daily needs of their three children who were in school. Sometimes Bella sells food in their neighborhood for n additional income because profit from her businesses alone can not supply the increasing demand of her family. Her eldest child, 21 years old hadn't even graduated from high school and her second child, 19 years had only graduated from elementary. It was a many years ago that Bella's two elder children stopped from going to school. During those years, Bella was not yet a member of ASHI and didn't have her own business. Now, through she requests from ASHI, she will be able to enhance her businesses to be able to finance the education of her nine year old youngest child until graduation in college. \nPresently, Bella requests for a much larger loan to be used in growing her hog fattening business (pig raising) and to be able to purchase a manicuring set to be able to generate daily income. Hog fattening business grows fast given enough business capital since the profit from it is as much double the amount of it capital after four months of fattening the pigs. Selling hogs in larger volume would really generate bigger profit. This is what Bella looks for in every loan she requests.

He lives with his partner, and they have seven children, two of whom are now adults and on their own. The other five are ages 19, 17, 12, 9, and 2.  They live together in their own house, that they managed to buy with a lot of effort. \r\n\r\nPedro grows rice on a small farm that he rents. He takes advantage of local conditions; in the rainy season he plants his crop, and provides the necessary care to see his plants grow little by little. \r\n\r\nHe has been doing this work for two years, with the help of some of his children, who are learning more and more about the work each day. This way, their father can provide them with both learning and food.  It's going very well for him, as he has good sales. He is a supplier to three important mills in the area, who are always waiting for him to bring them his crop to sell, as he produces one of the best crops in the area.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, it was very complicated for him to carry out this work, as he didn't have a lot of knowledge. But he took advantage of various workshop sessions, and learned everything he needed. \r\n\r\nHe doesn't consider himself an expert, but the knowledge he has allows him to harvest a good crop. In the future he wishes to have his own small farm, as when he rents, this takes away part of his earnings. \r\n\r\nIn addition, he wishes to set up a small store in his house, where his partner can sell merchandise and generate additional income for their household finances. \r\n\r\nThis will be his fourth loan with MFP. He is very happy to know that he will have a loan, since in this way, he will feel secure in moving forward with his business. Moreover, he is committed to once again making his instalment payments. \r\n\r\nWith the amount applied for, 1,500 soles, he will buy products for stocking the store in his house, and also spend a bit to pay laborers, so that he can maintain his small farm.

She is a hairdresser by profession.  Her husband teaches part-time on a farm and makes $20 a month, which barely covers one day of family expenses.  Aware of the situation, she began a small business selling beauty products to make ends meet.  However, the lack of sufficient means, particularly working capital, poses a serious handicap to her deteriorating finances.  And this highly devoted and enterprising woman is becoming poorer and poorer as a result.  So she is requesting a loan of $1,000 to grow her shop by paying cash for beauty supplies, a much less costly way to do it.  She may also acquire certain tools of the trade, notably two hairdryers.  The goal is to open a very modern hair salon of her own.  And the loan will help increase her turnover, so that she can provide for her family at all times.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAg\u00e9e de 29 ans, Madame A.

She learned the skills from her mother, who was a pastrymaking instructor at a culinary institute.

Justa needs capital to stock up on supplies to increase production, especially for the big festival of Todos Santos (All Saints) in November, in which it is traditional to eat various baked goods and pastries.  With the loan, Justa will hopefully be able to profit from this event to set up her own bakery in the comforts of her own home and ensure her family's well-being. \r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Geraldine Kim, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Trabajaba como enfermera en un importante centro m\u00e9dico, pero el bajo nivel de su salario la oblig\u00f3 a dedicarse a otras actividades, como la de tramitadora de documentos, certificados y otros.
