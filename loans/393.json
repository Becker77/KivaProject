is 43 years old and lives in the town of Pallisa in the Iganga region of Uganda. He is married and has six children, four of whom are currently in school. For the past fifteen years, Namuiima has been working hard to manage his market stand, which sells fresh produce. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Namuiima has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

Anjeline is a friendly member of the community with 12 children. Anjeline lives with her family in a house made of mud walls and an iron roof.\n\nOmbe village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from Ndiprao stream. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Anjeline\u2019s family, and the 55 other households using the local water source, need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nAnjeline has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Anjeline volunteered to be the promoter because she wants to help the community treat water in order to help prevent sicknesses. There is also another volunteer promoter from the surrounding community who is part of this group loan, named Millicent.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Anjeline\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1805282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To provide communities with free access to chlorine to treat their drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anjeline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Millicent ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":1796,"name":"Petko","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Petko V. is a 48 years old ex-military officer.

is gifted in the kitchen, adding her signature flavor to everything she makes; these are the qualities that compelled her to become the chef of her own small restaurant, which she started in her home two years ago. This business idea was born from the fact that her dear husband's salary couldn't cover their children's education or the nutrition of the little ones. Now, with this new income from the restaurant, things have gotten much better at home.

Despite his young age, he is already supporting his parents and, together with his brother, they\u2019ve been working at baking \u201clepeshka\u201d- traditional Tajik bread. He believes that this business is profitable and is not subject to seasonality. He gets up early and bakes the lepeshka and other bread so that people have  fresh bread on their tables for breakfast.<P>\r\n\r\n All the raw materials such as flour, salt, and yeast are purchased in the local market. Now, due to high demand, Fakhriddin wants to increase the number of his bread he bakes, so he is requesting US$ 800  for a term of 12 months. The loan shall be spent for purchasing flour and coal for baking the \u201clepeshka\u201d. In future, together with his brother, Fakhriddin is dreaming of openning their own workshop and with the profit, building his own house and his family.  Fakhriddin deeply appreciates the trust and support you give him. \r\n<P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International <P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Josephine has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 8,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Josephine joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the fifth loan taken out by Josephine from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and to save for the future.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

In this regard, they need to earn more income so that they are able to support their children's studies.<P>\r\n\r\nExequiel is a 'jeepney' driver while his wife is engaged in running a general store, selling different snacks and groceries. Every week, they are able to earn an average net income of P 1,500 which they utilize to acquire their daily basic needs and pay the tuition fees and allowances of their children. In this regard, they need to earn a higher income so that they can maintain their businesses and they are able to meet their daily needs. <P>\r\n\r\nBecause of this, Exequiel applied for a loan amounting to P 5,000 to be used for the maintenance of his 'jeepney' and for improvement to his wife's business. They believe that they will be able to improve their living conditions with the support of KIVA lenders.<P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":416042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"additional capital for the maintenance of their businesses ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"DMP Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2009-11-04T19:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Exequiel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":208.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.2},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.2},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.2},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.2},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":833.32,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":991.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103725843},{"amount":5.21,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:59:08Z","rounded_local_amount":247.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103725844},{"amount":5.21,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":247.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103725845},{"amount":5.21,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:05:21Z","rounded_local_amount":247.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103725846},{"amount":88.54,"local_amount":3541.69,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4215.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110613496}],"funded_date":"2009-11-05T03:08:57Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T11:24:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":153544,"name":"Dante","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dante H. is from the village of Plaridel, Claveria, Misamis Oriental.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He works from 7:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m., from Monday to midday Saturday. \r\n\r\nMr. V. is married and doesn't have any children. With the purchase of construction materials, such as bricks for flooring, he hopes to complete construction on the house that he and his wife have been building through their own hard work.\r\n\r\nThis is the third loan that Mr. V. has had with Ceprodel over the course of 2 years. These loans have positively impacted him since he doesn't have enough income to finance construction on his house.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fishing.  Rosalia has 6 years of experience in this business.  Rosalia needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosalia joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Rosalia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Rosalia .I. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Philippines. She is 54 years old, married, and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, she makes and sells snacks and other delicacies in the local community. She is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fedeline joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make the products she sells. Fedeline is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which again will be used to purchase raw ingredients. This will be her 4th loan from PMPC.

She is 36 years-old. Angeles is married and has six school-aged children. To make a living, Angeles owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling coconuts for copras (dried meat) and coconut charcoals in the local community. Angeles has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Angeles joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Angeles has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and to provide working capital. Angeles is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional coconuts to sell. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Angeles from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She operates a business making and selling baked goods: pies, alfajores, cakes, chocolates, cookies, etc.  Maria has operated the business for 3 years and she works to order.  She knows her customers and they know her.  They come to her house to order whatever baked goods they need.  She has steadily added customers over the years as her reputation for making quality products has grown.  Maria buys her supplies at retail supermarkets because the prices are better.  She will use this loan from Fondo Esperanza, plus her own savings, to buy construction materials for adding a space to her house where she can set up a shop.  Her house is near a school so she thinks building the shop there will help her business.  She hopes to attract new customers, as well.  To complete the project, she needs a permit to set up a home-based store.  Maria lives with her 2 children, 11- and 7-years old, respectively.  She wants to set up the bakery so that she can provide her children with a good education and a better life.  Fondo Esperanza has been a great help to Maria's business because she has learned how to better spend her money and the loans that she's received from the bank have helped her to increase her income.  She also enjoys the regular meetings that Fondo Esperanza arranges with other members of the bank.  Curico is a town in Maule, a region of central Chile.  The area has a Mediterranean climate and is considered to be among the most pleasant in the country.  It's also know for its wines and its natural beauty.  According to the latest census figures, the area is also one of the poorest in Chile despite a growing workforce."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":719472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Construction materials for food business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Curic\u00f3","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-03-11T20:06:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":304886,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":14173},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16235},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":16340},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":16446},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":16552},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":16659},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":16767},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":16875},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":16984},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":17094},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17204},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":17315},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":17427},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":17540},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":17653},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":17767},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":17849},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":18006}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.22},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.61},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.83},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.07},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.28},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.52},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.97},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.21},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.45},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.15},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.4},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.63},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.05},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":134.73,"local_amount":63194,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":64904.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201282265},{"amount":142.52,"local_amount":66853,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":68662.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206150272},{"amount":183.4,"local_amount":86024,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":88352.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211223355},{"amount":150.96,"local_amount":70809,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":72725.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216502329},{"amount":38.39,"local_amount":18006,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":18493.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227035335}],"funded_date":"2011-03-12T21:38:04Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:06:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":285355,"name":"Emmanuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emmanuel has a wife and two children.

She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy wood for her work.  In the future, Asha plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.   \r\n\r\nIn Nepal, furniture is still made the old-fashioned way.  Using little more than basic hand tools, skilled artisans form raw lumber into beautifully finished pieces of furniture.  With precision and an eye for detail, furniture makers produce shelves, bed frames, and cabinet sets.  With the help of a Kiva loan, a furniture maker is able to increase the volume of their lumber purchases or hire additional labor.  This additional leverage allows an entrepreneur to increase productivity and profitability. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering micro-credit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

He hopes to use the profit from this loan to acquire more land for farming to increase his maize production and educate his children in the future.\r\n\r\nLeonard's hope and dream is to become a large scale farmer and buy a bigger piece of land and build a permanent home. He is a diligent man who can do more if supported financially.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":894227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy maize seeds and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Narok","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 36.866667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2011-10-21T16:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonard ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":40895.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287618017}],"funded_date":"2011-10-22T23:35:28Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:31:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Sharfman","image":562243}},{"id":350954,"name":"Bukeru","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bukeru is 43 years old and lives in the town of Bugiri, which is located in the Iganga region of Uganda.

pesticide-selling venture. In the season mentioned, Saidjon made adequate income, which was used to improve his home and saved for his children\u2019s education expenses. While diligently selling fertilizer that season, his land sat uncompleted and derelict. The current rainy season is a suitable time for planting. Saidjon is taking the initiative to resume working on his land while selling fertilizer. He has requested funds to purchase farm supplies such as seeds and fertilizer. Saidjon is optimistic his venture will be successful and all his expended effort will better the family\u2019s welfare.    \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has five school-aged children.\r\n\r\nLemalie owns and operates a business making and selling food, selling dried goods in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 400 WST a month.\r\n\r\nLemalie joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,000 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nLemalie is now requesting a new loan of 1,750 WST which will again be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be her 4th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Fe aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   soft drinks dealer, cosmetics products and transport businesses. Her husband Bamberto, who is 37 years old, works as a driver to earn his living .  They have three children who are between 12 to 14 years old. Monaliza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Monaliza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, with which she intends to buy stock of soft drinks and cosmetics to sell so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children. Monaliza is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

 Sokphun A. (age 24) married in 2002 and has two children (see photo).  She and her family live in a small village across the Mekong River about fifteen kilometers north of Phnom Penh.  She is requesting this, her second loan with Maxima, to buy materials for weaving.  <P>\r\n\r\nSokphun learned to weave when she was a teenager over the course of a year in which she traveled to a nearby island in the Mekong.  It\u2019s not uncommon in this area for young people to apprentice with experienced weavers.  Initially they weave the simplest designs and, as their skills improve, their output is exchanged as fees for instruction. Sokphum has since passed along the craft to a younger sister.<P>\r\n\r\nIn addition to weaving, Sokphun and her husband also farm rice to feed the family.  He also does construction work in the area.  She explained that the loan will help her by allowing her to buy weaving materials for cash rather than by barter with a middleperson.  If she works with a middleperson, she trades two of every three finished pieces just to pay for the weaving thread.  She, in turn, gets the sales price from a single piece.  If she pays cash for the thread, the cost is cheaper.  If she sells for cash, she can increase her profit by as much as 10% or more per piece. Sokphum smilingly expressed confidence that she could easily repay her loan because, with the quality of her weaving, she can sell all she makes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":93367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase thread and other weaving materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Khsach Kandal district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":61,"posted_date":"2007-12-05T16:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sokphun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-19T17:52:36Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118281},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138380},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-19T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":161386},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-04-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:45:50Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":186448},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-05-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":214376},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-06-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":242476},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-07-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":271494},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-08-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":300724},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-09-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331432},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-10-19T09:00:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365491},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T09:18:49Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5332336},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9953514}],"funded_date":"2007-12-05T17:52:36Z","paid_date":"2009-01-16T01:05:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":30501,"name":"Dafrosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dafrosa, age 33, is married with a 4-year-old child.

Thanh Hoa City is the provincial capital of Thanh Hoa province, one of the poorest provinces in Vietnam.

She will use the proceeds from her loan to buy clothes for her market stall.  \r\n\r\nShe buys women's clothes in the Vuon Hoa market and sells them in the Dong Thanh market. With this loan, she will be able to buy 10 jackets on which she expects to make a 13% profit. She buys jackets for 160,000 VND (~US $9.15) and sells them for 180,000 VND (~US $10.30).  On a good day when the weather is chilly (as it is now), she can sell 5 jackets a day.\r\n\r\nMrs. Luong will use the profits from her loan to pay for her children's school fees and for general household expenditures. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be split equally between 6 borrowers. The other borrowers in the group will use their share of the loan as follows:\r\n\r\n* Mrs. Yen is borrowing 1,626,900 Vietnamese Dong (~ US$93) to buy material that she will use to make and sell women\u2019s clothes.\r\n* Mrs. Chien will buy many kinds of small fish to sell in the Dong Thanh market.\r\n* Mrs. Bien will buy outfits to rent to others for special occasions (Teacher Day, Army Day, etc.)\r\n* Mrs. Nguyet will buy pork to make lean pork paste and grilled chopped meat to sell in the Dong Thanh market.\r\n* Mrs. Minh Quyet will buy bowls and dishes to sell in the Dong Thanh market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":255569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy clothes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Vietnam","town":"Thanh Ho\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":121,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T05:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"L\u01b0\u01a1ng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Y\u1ebfn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chi\u1ebfn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bi\u1ec3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nguy\u1ec7t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Minh Quy\u1ebft","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":9761400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:28:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20398717},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27090644},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984011},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44444664},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52955276},{"amount":95.85,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63172627}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T09:31:46Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:39:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"June Blender","image":123338}},{"id":87868,"name":"Aditcha","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Dame A.

To make a living, Felicidad owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.

Felicidad is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be Felicidad's first loan from ASKI.

Los a\u00f1os le han ense\u00f1ado a Artemio que tiene que trabajar muy duro si quiere que sus cultivos sean los mejores de su poblado.

He is a man who has always struggled to get ahead in life. He lives alone in his own house, and what he desires the most is to have a peaceful retirement. Through the years, Artemio has learnt that he needs to work very hard if he wants his crops to be the best of his village; and so, with great effort he has succeeded in becoming a leader in the production of potatoes, peas, spinach and carrots. Every one of his crops is highly requested in the markets of the town of Tarma, which is where he gets the best incomes. He has been engaged in this activity for 45 years. What he likes the most about his job is harvesting his products, and he thinks the most difficult part is keeping his lands free form the weeds that constantly grow in his crops. He also says that in his free time he works as a farmhand in other farm lands, as well as by transporting products from the countryside to the city using donkeys, which is known as \"aseminas\". He is now getting ready to harvest his next \u201cAndina\u201d potato crop, which will be ripen by next week. He is a member of the Banco Comunal \u201cVigen Mar\u00eda\u201d (Virgin Mary Communal Bank), this is the ninth loan he has requested to MFP, and he hopes for its cooperation to keep on working towards his goals. On the other hand, he once more commits to complying with the repayments of his dues, as he has done with the previous loans he has requested. On top of this, he likes being a part of his communal bank because all of its members are very responsible and caring people.\r\nUpon receiving the loan, Artemio will invest the money he has requested to buy a bag of pea seeds and 25 kilos of spinach seeds, and he will use them to start his next crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":806496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a bag of pea seeds and 25 kilos of spinach seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-12T08:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Artemio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1029.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712705}],"funded_date":"2011-07-14T13:03:10Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emanuela Villa","image":625792}},{"id":318170,"name":"Asha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asha, 36, is the married mother of two children.

Life in rural areas of the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to healthcare. Despite these difficulties, Sujeiri runs a successful business running a small eatery. With this loan, Sujeiri plans to purchase more food including rice, beans, and sugar.\r\n \r\nThis is Sujeiri\u2019s sixth loan with Esperanza International, and she hopes to continue taking out loans to grow her business and improve life for her family. With her profits, Sujeiri hopes to purchase equipment so that she can also start baking cakes. She will also use her profits to purchase school supplies for her daughter, including a backpack, notebooks, and pencils. Sujeiri is currently studying as well, and her loans have provided her business with the profits that will get her through school. In the future, Sujeiri hopes to build a house of her own that she can pass along to her family.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope.

He realizes that the loan he will receive will be very beneficial for his work. \r\n\r\nBesides being a member of his communal group, he enjoys keeping order at the meetings.\r\n\r\nHe will use the 3000 new soles requested to buy manure and insecticide to care for his crops so that they will be more productive.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":519904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy manure and insecticides for his potato and gladioli crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-05T23:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aurelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3009.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588010}],"funded_date":"2010-04-06T18:00:16Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":195256,"name":"Bayarjargal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bayrjargal is a widow with two children.

He is separated from Marcelia, with whom he had 5 children, but as a good father, his life revolves around caring for them and offering them a better quality of life since they are all still minors.  He lives in his own house located in the native community of Pumpuriana (central Peruvian jungle).  From the time he was very young he worked in agriculture and when he started his family, more than 22 years ago, he began to farm his own fields.  He started with plantains and coffee, foremost products of the Peruvian jungle.  But with his years of experience and dedication, he learned to grow \u201cachiote\u201d (annnato) which is a more difficult crop and very few people work with it.  That makes Elvin one of  the few producers in his area.  His sales are profitable and thus he gets a good income \u201cthe same buyers personally come to purchase his products\u201d he says.  Besides, he has more than one crop per year and this generates more income.  In the future he wants to buy his own land since what he works on now are communal fields. With this he plans to consolidate his production and be able to pay university studies of his children.  \r\n\r\nHe knows that the opportunity offered him by the association will help him get ahead, because without them he knows can\u2019t achieve more.  This will work out very happily for him.  He belongs to the Hormiguitas de Pumpuriani communal bank and this is his sixth loan with MFP, where he is happy to know that he will have the financial support that he needs.  He promises again to make all his payments on time as he did with previous loans.  He appreciates being part of the communal bank because all of the members are responsible and united.  Elvin will use the requested money  to buy bags of organic fertilizer (natural fertilizer) and he will hire some field hands to help him fertilize and clean out the weeds in his crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":806518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sakcs of organic fertilizer and to hire field hands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-10T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":823.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621412}],"funded_date":"2011-07-11T03:02:42Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":318186,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca, 66, has practiced farming in Ndunyu Njeru town for the last six years.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

Through leasing and leaseback, SELFINA provides a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets. As they lack tangible collateral assets, they are termed not creditworthy by financial institutions.

This mother of three children has learned to accept life's lessons.  This attitude has helped her to raise her children and provide them with good education so they grow up responsibly.  At this time, she is still responsible to school her smallest child, Komang Trisna Putra who is in 8th grade.  The other children has been able to afford their living independently, even though only working as manual labor.  Her love to the her family made Ni Luh Darmi tried to help her husband in supporting the family's financial needs.  She decided to start fattening pigs, a business chosen by other women in her neighborhood, so she could also learn from their experiences.  She does not make  much profit, only about $22 to 33 for each pig slaughtered after three months fattening.  However, it helped cover some household needs, from kitchen supplies, health care, and other needs.  DINARI is going to help her by providing a loan for her to buy more pigs and more feeds.\r\n\r\n<b><p>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer <\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nHidup dalam kesederhanaan sudah menjadi bagian dalam kehidupan Ni Luh Darmi. Ibu yang memiliki 3 (tiga) orang anak ini selalu belajar untuk menerima setiap hal yang dialaminya sebagai pelajarang yang berharga dalam hidupnya. Hal inilah yang membuatnya mampu membesarkan anak-anaknya dan memberikan mereka didikan yang baik sehingga mereka bisa bertumbuh menjadi anak yang patuh dan ulet. Saat ini tanggung jawabnya dalam memberikan pendidikan secara formal masih kepada anaknya yang paling kecil yaitu Komang Trisna Putra yang masih duduk di kelas dua Sekolah Menengah Pertama, sedangkan yang lainnya sudah mampu membiayai hidupnya masing-masing karena sudah bekerja walaupun hanya sebagai buruh kasar. \r\nKecintaannya terhadap keluarga membuat hatinya tergerak untuk ikut serta mengupayakan kesejahteraan keluarganya dengan membantu suaminya untuk bisa memenuhi kebutuhan hidup yang semakin hari semakin meningkat.  Jalan yang ditempuhnya adalah dengan memlihara babi penggemukan seperti yang juga digeluti oleh banyak ibu-ibu yang lainnya sehingga Ni Luh Darmi bisa belajar dari setiap keberhasilan mereka. Keuntungan yang diperolehnya memang tidak terlalu besar yaitu sekitar Rp 200.000,- Rp 300.000,- per ekor dari memelihara babi untuk babi guling yang dipelihara hanya dua atau tiga bulan saja, tetapi  itu cukup bermanfaat dalam menutupi segala kekurangan biaya rumah tangganya baik itu keperluan dapur, kesehatan perumahan ataupun hal lainnya. DINARI memberinya bantuan modal usaha dan itu dipakainya untuk menambah jumlah penggemukan yang dipeliharanya dan juga untuk memenuhi kebutuhan pakan ternaknya tersebut."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":123588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

Nazurov  lives in the town of Yavan. He is 53 years old, married and has five children. He has a college education and has graduated from a pedagogical university. He is a teacher by profession and works in a polytechnic college. In the rural areas most people are in the animal husbandry business. Iskhok also does that and breeds calves for meat sales. He wants to buy a few more calves and resell them after 2-3 months. He needs a loan for that and it will help him increase commodity circulation and also increase his family's income. He has been in this business for the past ten years. Besides money this business also brings joy to his family. He plans to pay off the loan within 9 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\u041d\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0418\u0441\u0445\u043e\u043a

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nElena is married and has 5 school-aged children. Elena owns & operates a manufacturing business. The main source of income comes from manufacturing & selling bamboo products like \"amakan\" and sticks for barbecues to local businesses and community members. Elena has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Elena joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Elena is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Elena from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The loan will also help him sign larger contracts, which will generate higher revenues for Juan\u2019s business.\r\n\r\nBeing self-employed and generating income for his family have been Juan\u2019s greatest successes. He has great pride in providing for his wife and two young daughters. Juan enjoys managing his own business and loves the flexibility of his work. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":578396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To
