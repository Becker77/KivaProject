To follow her dreams, a year ago she decided to sell sugar cane juice which she sells by displaying glasses of the juice to people. Haydee is very happy because she is seeing the fruits of her labor reflected in the income she brings in. Sometimes she doesn't sell very much but she compensates for this on other days. She is very thankful to her father who encouraged her to buy the necessary items to begin this small business. She is applying for a loan so that she can increase sells by buying more sugar cane to make her delicious juice.\r\n\r\n<b><p>Translated from Spanish by Alison Rives, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nHaydee, es una dama muy trabajadora y  se desempe\u00f1a con mucha dedicaci\u00f3n y esfuerzo porque quiere forjarse un futuro prominente.

She lives with her partner, is 50 years old, and has one child that is still dependent on her.\r\n\r\nFor many years Charito has worked selling firewood.  When she began, she tells us, her sales were a little low but with time once her friends, neighbors, and family learned of her business her sales grew. She began with 300 Soles and little by little continued to save. Now she has added to her business with the sale of juanes [leafy packets stuffed with rice, chicken, and olives] from her own house.\r\n\r\nOne of her dreams and goals to achieve is to start a large grocery store in order to generate more income and contribute economically in her home.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of 1,200 Soles she will buy 2,780 units of firewood. Part of the money will also be invested in supplies to prepare the juanes, like rice, chicken by the kilo, food colors, and bijao [an Amazonian plant] leaves.\r\n\r\nThese days she feels like a very fulfilled woman with more hopes of reaching her dreams and making them real.

She couldn't continue her studies because she had to start working with her husband in the farms. Her husband has had other 4 wives and a total of 74 children, so Joana has to work hard to support herself and her children. She's been in this business for the past 25 years, and she has no employees, but counts with the help of children and sons-in-law. Her best selling product is corn. Her husband is now in the hospital and she has several medical bills to pay.\r\n\r\nShe's asking for a 25.000,00MT (U$875) loan in order to invest in her business and make more money in the near future.

He is 35 years old, married, and has three children aged from 6 to 18 years old. Saturday did not have the opportunity to go to school due to poverty.\n\nFor the last three years, Saturday has had a money changing business.  Liberia's currency is the Liberian\ndollar, which trades at about 70 LRD to the U.S. dollar, but the U.S. dollar is also legal tender in the country and is widely accepted.  Firestone, the country's largest private employer, pays its employees in U.S. dollars, so Saturday's services are in high demand when it's payday for Firestone workers. Saturday also sells mobile phone chargers at the Harbel market in Margibi county, Liberia.\n\nHe started selling at the Cotton Tree community in Harbel City with 20,000 LRD as working capital.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, as well as epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's history:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She got married when she was 18 years old and had four children. Her husband subsequently passed away. \r\nIn 1981, when she turned 26, she got married to her second husband and had three more children. She tried to work as a house-keeper but it did not work out - that is when she decided to start a business selling clothes that were purchased during trips to South Africa. \r\nHer business' income has helped her husband cover their children's expenses- his income comes from a pension plan.\r\nIn 2006, she was tipped off by a friend about Hluvuku. She was granted a loan in the amount of 8.500,00mt. A year after that she applied for another loan in the amount of 15.000,00mt. Both amounts were used to buy additional clothes that gave the business a more solid structure. \r\nIn the future, she wishes to build a bigger house where she can live with her family with dignity, for their current home is too small and it is not in good condition. \r\nShe also wants to settle in a small store where she could sell clothes and a vehicle to transport merchandise, which is now needed thanks to high demands.<p>\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\nCliente: Isabel Jos\u00e9 M.\r\nActividade:Com\u00e9rcio\r\nValor do Empr\u00e9stimo:15.000,00MT (600.00US$)\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o do Empr\u00e9stimo:compra e venda de Roupa\r\nIn\u00edcio:11\/07\/2007\r\nFim:31\/07\/2008\r\n\r\nIsabel Jos\u00e9 M. nascido em 23de Junho de 1957 em Matola na prov\u00edncia de Maputo ,cresceu junto dos seus pais tendo estudado at\u00e9 7\u00aaclasse .

It is comprised of a lovely collection of women who, along with Ruth Gutierrez their credit assistant, work hard to make their businesses a success.  They are pleased because they have an opportunity to qualify for investments as well as loan funds that are offered through this entity.  A majority of the members are married and have an average of five children.  Some, like Mrs. Malena, cannot count on any help from a partner\/spouse.  She was abandoned by her husband, leaving her as sole provider for their four minor children who do their best to help their mother while she works as a street vendor selling fruit.  There is a variety of activities within the group.  We were able to observe that commerce\/sales is the primary enterprise and the members sell clothes, in-season fruits, food, tableware, school supplies and other items.  Some offer their products at retail from fixed locations, and others work as street vendors.  It is certain that with additional capital they would be able to buy their merchandise at wholesale.  This would allow them to obtain greater profits which would, in turn, help their small businesses to prosper and provide a higher standard of living for their families.  <p>\r\n\r\nNote:  There are some camera-shy members within the organization, which is why they are not very visible in the photograph.    <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEN LA ZONA DE VILLA ADELA FUNCIONA EL CENTRO FOCAL DEL MISMO DE NOMBRE DE PRO-MUJER, A ESTE PRETENECE LA ASOCIACION \"COSTE\u00d1ITAS II\" UN LINDO GRUPO DE SE\u00d1ORAS QUE CON LA AYUDA DE SU ASISTENTE DE CREDITOS RUTH GUTIERREZ  TRABAJAN INTENSAMENTE PARA QUE SUS NEGOCIOS PROSPEREN.\r\nADEMAS ELLAS ESTAN MUY CONTENTAS PORQUE TIENEN LA OPORTUNIDAD DE CAPACITARSE SOBRE INVERSIONES ADEMAS DE OBTENER LOS CREDITOS QUE LA ENTIDAD OFRECE.\r\nEN EL GRUPO LA MAYORIA SON CASADAS  CON UN PROMEDIO DE 5 HIJOS, ALGUNAS DE ELLAS NO CUENTAN CON LA AYUDA DE SU PAREJA, POR EJEMPLO A DO\u00d1A MALENA SU ESPOSO LA ABANDONO, TENIENDO ELLA QUE HACERSE CARGO DE SUS CUATRO HIJOS MENORES DE EDAD, LOS CUALES  INTENTAN AYUDAR A SU MAMA EN LA VENTA DE FRUTAS DE MANERA AMBULANTE.\r\nEXISTEN DISTINTOS TIPOS DE ACTIVIDADES DENTRO DEL GRUPO,PUDIMOS OBSERVAR QUE EL  COMERCIO ES LA ACTIVIDAD PRINCIPAL, ELLAS OFRECEN LA VENTA DE ROPA, FRUTAS DE LA TEMPORADA, COMIDA, VAJILLAS, MATERIAL ESCOLAR  Y OTROS ENCERES.

She lives in a rented room and what she wants most is to improve her quality of life. Her stand is located in the market of San Jose (an important market in the city of Juliaca). She sells clothes, which she brings to the cities of Tacna (south of Peru) and Desaguadero (on the border with Bolivia). Marina is a very persuasive seller and always convinces her clients to buy something. What she likes most about her work is talking with her clients and advising them about what clothing is best for them.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her customers include neighbors, family members and friends, but she principally seeks out clients who have a steady income and are able to make the payments for the merchandise she sells them on credit. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and she will invest it in buying shoes, sports clothing, men's shirts and perfumes, which have been ordered by customers referred to her. She is very satisfied with the way her business allows her to support her nuclear family, and for this reason she is working hard to make it grow, in order to provide her two little ones with the best opportunities she can. This is precisely the reason why she started the business, and it has given her good results, because her income has gradually been increasing. Her goal for the future is to acquire her own home, and Dina Luz is preparing for this day by day.  \r\n   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php250 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php29,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nMagdalena dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

lives with his wife and son in Ica.  He loves them and they are his main reason for living.  He is a friendly, hardworking, and enthusiastic man who dedicates all of his effort to getting his family ahead.  Unfortunately Javier was not able to study for a professional career because he had to go to work when he was very young, but he would have liked to do it.  He likes to play soccer in his spare time and sometimes cooks a delicious chicken with rice dish to enjoy.  It\u2019s his favorite dish.\r\n\r\nHe has been working as a construction laborer for several years and works daily beginning early morning and can work up to 12 hours a day.

He came up with this idea after realizing that molasses was readily available due to availability of a sugar industry in his area and he could make use of this opportunity to create a molasses business for a living to support his family. He is the sole provider for his family and this business is the one that has supported his family for over 5 years now. He is married with 4 children.\r\n\r\nHis business location is in a suburb town within Kisumu city called Muhoroni. There is a sugar factory called Muhoroni Sugar Factory from which he gets his molasses. His business is unique in that there are few people in the area who thought of establishing a business like his. The interruptions that occurred to his business due to the post-election violence slightly affected his supply and necessitated a refinancing. This is the basis for the current loan that he is seeking.\r\n\r\nIn his group he has a leadership role as the group Chairman. His leadership style is unique in that in addition to being a strong leader, he has devoted part of his time to counseling the group members affected by the post-election violence as a way of ensuring that the group business activities pick up faster. This has endeared him to his group members who view him as a servant leader who is both concerned about their businesses and their social needs. His group leadership qualities have thus ensured that his group is among the most united in the region. Another unique feature of the group that has led to their current cohesion is his highly participative type of leadership which has encouraged members to voice their opinions openly without fear of victimization.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Kiva is working with OI-WEDCO to refinance businesses disrupted by Kenya's post-election violence.  The group above has received loans from OI-WEDCO in the past and is now working to rebuild their businesses and to get back on their feet.Due to recent events in Kenya, the security situation in many communities remains unsettled, affecting many local businesses.

They live in extended traditional families with co-spouses and other relatives in the Kimparana village (Prefecture of San, 4th administrative region in the Republic of Mali). Linked by socio-economical bonds, their main business is food-serving, but they also sell condiments and fruits. Anxious to satisfy and ever-increasing clientele, the members of the group decided to join the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso a year ago. After a first solidarity loan repaid without problems, the  group is now seeking a second loan to be used to buy 100 kg of rice and a large amount of various condiments.\r\nThey purchase raw materials in the grand market of Koutiala, from wholesale resellers, and in Kimparana during fair days. The dishes they serve are usually composed of rice with various sauces (beans, spaghetti, etc) and sold in front of the family house or in small luncheonettes located in the Kimparana market. The dishes are sold every day all year long, usually for cash and sometimes on credit.\r\nThey foresee they will each turn a monthly profit of XOF 50'000 (ca US$ 100), to be used to repay the loan and to pay for daily family expenses.

This is 48-year-old Beth M. from Tukuyu. She is married with four children, between the ages of 16 and 28. Beth has operated a restaurant since 1991. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 13-16 hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by her children. Beth currently earns about $13 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $375 in order to purchase more maize flour, rice and cooking oil. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of her business . Beth thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more maize flour, rice and cooking oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T16:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beth K.

Their home is located 20 kilometers from the city.\r\n\r\nHe has his own land where he cultivates coffee and plantain. He works with the help of his wife and four of their children, who mainly help him during the harvest, since his wife tends to the domestic chores on a daily basis and their children study. The thing he likes most is keeping his lands clean and planting new crops, but he doesn't like when a plague or the harshness of the climate harms his fruits. However, Dario considers it a challenge. In 20 years, neither plague nor bad weather has defeated him. Coffee is his most profitable product, and each year after selling it, it leaves him with a good income with which he purchases more farmland. On the other hand, every 15 days the plantains allow him to cover his domestic expenses and the education of his children. In the future, with the financing of a governmental program, he plans to create a reforestation project with timber-yielding plants that he has been raising in his nursery.\r\n\r\nThis is the the fourth loan that he has requested through MFP, and he assures that with each payment he will continue demonstrating his responsibility and punctuality. He is quite grateful to the organization and the people in his communal bank, because they always show solidarity with each one of the members. With the money that he is currently requesting, he will purchase 1,000 coffee plants, 400 citric fruit plants, and he will contract workers to adequately prepare his lands.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mark Broscoe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":502149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase coffee and fruit plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-07T19:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1565.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153863}],"funded_date":"2010-03-07T21:55:41Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mark Broscoe","image":null}},{"id":187206,"name":"Theresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theresa sells slightly used bags.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  General Store and Ready-to-Wear Clothes businesses. \r\n\r\n Maricon joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maricon has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 which she intends to use to buy more stock for her Ready-to-Wear Clothes and General store businesses so that she can continue to save up for future needs. \r\n\r\nMaricon G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n About NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her youngest child has suffered from hydrocephalus for over a year and necessitates special medical attention; hence, family medical expenses are extremely high. With the loan of 1,000 dollars she intends to increase the volume of merchandise at both her stands so that customers can avoid daily excursions to the city to purchase essential goods. The loan will also allow her to diversify the products so as to attract more customers to her stands and actively respond to their demands.

She lives with them in her own home and what she wants more than anything is to give them a good education. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe chose to perform her work, which is to raise trout, in the early morning, when she travels to the cages she has in Lake Titicaca where the trout are waiting to be fed. Sonia likes her work very much, as she enjoys the beautiful scenery formed by the lake. She hopes she can increase the number of cages she has, as currently they are not enough to keep up with the demand that she has encountered. She has been in this business for 12 years, and what she likes least about it is that there are days when it is very cold when she goes out to feed the trout, but she knows she still must do it, because her family's income depends on the production of her trout. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n This is Sonia's first loan with MFP (a Kiva Partner), and she plans to pay back all of her installments on time, as she does not want to jeopardize the members of her communal bank, with which she is very involved and invested.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling coconut in the local community. Edmar has been engaged in his business for over three years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Edmar joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Edmar has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional coconut to sell. Edmar is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Edmar from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family and to pay tuition for his children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

Takhminakhon is 42 years old. She is a very active and passionate woman who started her business in 1999 and has become very experienced and skilled in breeding sheep. She has applied for a loan of $1,100 to expand her flock. Takhminakhon believes this will help her generate greater revenue and, ultimately, greater profit for her family. In the future, she plans to buy additional sheep and increase her income further. We hope that you will play an important role in Takhminakhon's family life, because she deeply appreciates the trust and support lenders give her.     \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Helen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Helen is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Helen from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

The municipal president granted him the place he has in his poulterer\u2019s shop. This business is very important since his mother depends on it, he is able to make payments, and he can support  his family. His favorite part of his job is meeting people in his clientele such as women, young women, men, and variations. His business is popular for treating his customers well.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with access to the varied financial services they need.

When Fatma requested her first loan, she was newly separated from her husband and living in her neighbor\u2019s wooden shed with her six-year-old son.  Neighbors suggested that she should take a loan from Maya to open up new possibilities for her future.  \r\n\r\nFatima's life has changed since meeting with a Maya loan officer.  She was accepted into a group and received a loan for $450.  With a small part of the loan she found a small place to rent and bought some furniture and other household items.  With the remaining money, she went to Istanbul and bought some loose beads and some things for the boh\u00e7a trade (usually cheaply made pajamas, clothes, table clothes, etc. that are wrapped up a cloth and carried on one\u2019s back to sell around the neighborhoods).  Sometimes Fatima took her boh\u00e7a on her back to make sales and sometimes she made prayer beads from the loose beads she had bought and sold them at mosques and on street corners.  She repaid her first loan and requested another.  With her second loan she bought more items for the boh\u00e7a trade.\r\n\r\nOn the days she was not out selling, Fatima was planting and raising vegetable seedling in an unused garden spot next to her house.  She took the seedlings and started to sell them at the local bazaar.  She saw that she could earn more money raising vegetable seedlings.  She repaid her second loan.  For her third through fifth loans she concentrated on expanding the areas where she could raise seedlings and planted produce to sell in the bazaar.  Her business was going so well that during this time she built a house, bought a vehicle to transport her expanding seedling and produce supplies to the bazaar, and hired a seasonal worker.   \r\n\r\nWith her sixth loan, Fatima will continue to expand her business using the loan to rent additional fields, buy seeds, fertilizer, watering supplies, and materials for a greenhouse. Fatma\u2019s life has changed a lot.  She is now a free and happy woman.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Fatima wants to rent other fields and upgrade her vehicle. She also hopes to own her own fields, so she won\u2019t have to rent but can have her own land and production, and travel to holy places.  She wants her son to be successful in school, his work and make investments for their retirement.\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff\r\n\r\nFatma Han\u0131m 45 ya\u015f\u0131nda ve dul.

Fernando","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Azarias is 31 years old and is originally from Inhambane. His parents died when he was very young, so he moved with his 3 brothers to Maputo, where he went to school until 5th grade. He is married and has 4 children: the 2 oldest girls (11 and 8 years old) already go to school.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 1998 Azarias started working at \u201cPadaria do Papa\u201d, a bakery shop in Maputo, where he learnt how to bake bread. In 2002 he decided to open his own bakery shop, but Maputo would be very competitive, so he moved to Ponta D\u2019Ouro, where wood was very accessible. Ponta D\u2019Ouro is a beach village on the border with South Africa, very famous for its tourism, especially among South Africans.<P>\r\n\r\nAzarias worked in construction to save money to build his own oven, and in 2003 he had already started to bake bread. He bakes between 300 to 560 loaves of bread per day, depending on the season. Each loaf is sold for MTn 3.5 (around US$0.15) and they sell out very fast, as Azarias is one of the best bakers in the region (he sells to the most famous hotels and restaurants in Ponta D\u2019Ouro). A sack of 10 kilograms of wheat costs around MTn 200 (about US$ 8) and is enough to make 85 loaves of bread. His oven has the capacity to bake up to 100 loaves at once, so Azarias starts very early in the morning in order to finish baking by 6-7am. Azarias makes approximately MTn 7,500 (US$ 310) per month, and after paying expenses, including his 2 employees and the lady who helps with the house, his profit is around MTn 2,000 (US$ 83).<P>\r\n\r\nThis is Azarias\u2019s third loan with Hluvuku. The first two he used to buy raw materials (wheat, salt ,and yeast). This time Azarias plans to use his loan of US$ 350 to finish building a grocery store near the oven (which is inside his yard \u2013 near his house), where he plans to sell other food products. Azarias believes that he can even start buying some inventory with this loan. The lady who works at his house will work at the grocery store, and his wife will take care of the house.<P>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Azarias would like to have a fourth loan to build another house on his land to increase his income through rent. In Ponta D\u2019Ouro many people come to work during the season and rent rooms, and Azarias believes this would be a good business venture.

town of Shahristan in Northern Tajikistan.

Islomdjon seeks loan support from IMON International to invest in his crops, later raise his harvest, and survive along with his family. With the part of the loan he will also purchase young cattle. With your help, Islomdjon will be able to get ahead.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was Se\u00f1ora Brice\u00f1o who encouraged them and motivated them to form this group.  One of these members is Eutemia Z. S\u00e1nchez.\r\n\r\nEutemia is 56 years old and has 5 children: 2 are dependent and the others are grown children who are independent.  She was left a widow at age 28, and for the last 24 years she has been in another relationship.\r\n\r\nEutemia specialized her studies in pastries, and as result she sells picarones (Peruvian doughnut-like treats), bundt cakes, cakes and other types of products.  She has been working in this business for 4 years, and has 30 years of experience in this line of work.  In addition, she makes knitted caps, scarves and vests out of wool and thread based on orders from her customers.\r\n\r\nShe invests her daily income in the education of her minor children.  Eutemia's goal is to educate and support her children so that they can become professionals. She also wants to finish building her home and invest in putting a small shop in her home, since in the area where she lives there are no shops.\r\n\r\nThe recent loan that Edaprospo- Prosperidad granted her will be invested to acquire a pre-fabricated kiosk.  She has the support of her current husband, who helps her with the expenses of her children and the household expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":594042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a pre-fabricated kiosk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-09-05T20:33:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eutemia Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Giannina Nataly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:25Z","rounded_local_amount":628.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390855},{"amount":225,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":628.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529135},{"amount":225,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":628.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665243},{"amount":225,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":628.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408510}],"funded_date":"2010-09-11T20:03:19Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":232304,"name":"Claudia Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Claudia y el se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9, son una pareja muy unida, el trabaja en una maquiladora de la localidad y ella combina el trabajo con el cuidado de la casa y de los hijos, ya que tiene una tienda de abarrotes y pi\u00f1atas en su casa.

There she has a business selling a variety of merchandise.  She started in her business when her father, seeing her lacking enthusiasm because she couldn't find work, took out a loan and gave her half of it so that she could start a business.  This is how Ang\u00e9lica, on the suggestion of an uncle, began buying sheet sets, towels and children's clothes that she sold in Ovejas, a village in Sucre department.  She took advantage of the fact that she has a lot of family members there and they made up her first domestic market.

Gayane's husband works at the Vanadzor Chemical plant, the youngest son goes to school, the middle son recently returned from the army, and the oldest graduated from a university this year and is currenly looking for work.  Gayane leases a space at the Vanadzor market and sells women's, men's and children's clothing 2-3 times per month.  Gayane and her work colleagues rent a car and go to Yerevan for merchandise.  She says that children's and women's clothing have the highest demand, and that is why she only sells undergarments out of men's clothing.  Gayane needs a loan in the sum of 700,000 for the purchase of clothing in anticipation of the start of a new school year.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":857033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The community of Kopudo village collects their drinking water from the local spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Kopudo\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. In Kopudo, 27 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Rebeca has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water to keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Benter, Felix, Walter, and Joseph.\n\nKopudo village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Rebeca believes that the dispenser will help to reduce water-borne diseases in the community.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Rebeca\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1803594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To provide communities with free access to chlorine to treat their drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rebeca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benter ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felix ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Walter ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":868294,"name":"Moti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moti, age 51 a widow resides in the Koraput district of Odisha.

innovative ideas in the form of a multiservice center. Located in downtown Ayacucho, Peru, Nancy\u2019s small business is has a state-of-the-art photocopy machine, public telephones, cell phone services, and a small grocery store. She opened her independent business eight months ago and already the customers are coming in droves to take advantage of the many services Nancy\u2019s business offers. \r\n\r\nGrowing up, Nancy\u2019s father owned a small public telephone business. She spent the majority of her life helping her father with the many daily chores that go into the maintenance of an independent business, learning the ropes. When Nancy got married and had two babies, it became very clear that although her husband worked very hard, his meager income was simply not sufficient to raise a healthy family. She decided it was time to become more economically independent and increase her contribution to the family.  She sold her home, took out a loan, and set to work establishing her new business. Using the experience she gained from years of observing her father as a foundation, Nancy built her business to not only incluD. public telephones, but cell phones, a copy machine, and a grocery store. \r\n\r\nAlthough Nancy is very pleased with the quick and obvious success of her business, she has bigger dreams she wishes to accomplish. Her space is very small and she is working toward the purchase of a much larger location to house even more services. The economic boosts she receives from her local bank, combined with her hard work and dedication, has given Nancy the ability to realize her greatest dreams.  She is currently requesting a loan of $400. With this money, she will buy more supplies for her grocery store and larger quantities of phone cards."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":93830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more supplies for her grocery store and larger quantities of phone cards","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-12-08T07:15:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy Helida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-22T14:12:45Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-22T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":120117},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140280},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-03-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":163849},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-04-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188838}],"funded_date":"2007-12-08T14:12:45Z","paid_date":"2008-04-22T09:10:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":30709,"name":"Teddy's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teddy is a 40 year-old woman.
