His wife takes care of the home. Margarito has a piece of land where he grows maize. He plants the crop and takes care of it right up until harvest time. Afterwards he sells the maize to various customers.\r\n\r\nMargarito and his family live in Ahuachap\u00e1n department, the same area where he has his fields. Although he gets well paid for his crop, it is very hard work especially during the rainy season when the plants are often affected. \r\n\r\nMargarito is seeking a loan so that he can buy a larger quantity of maize to plant. He also wants to buy beans so that he has something else to sell, and wholesale fertilizer to provide his fields with the care they need. This venture is very important to him as it is the only means he has of supporting his family.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  raising pigs and  selling ready-to-wear clothing. Her husband Leopoldo, who is 44 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 9 children who are 4 to 24 years old with 4 of their children already working while the other 4 are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nYolanie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Yolanie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she could continue to save up for future business expansion. Yolanie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This will be the third loan taken out by Ludy from HSPFI.

This is where she started her family together with Crispin; her husband of 29 years.  The couple have 7 children and, through their efforts, they have managed to provide them with what they need.  Now they are caring for their youngest son Rony.\r\n\r\nWith the calmness that she displays, Julia shaped her family.  Her main financial driving force and inspiration is \"farming\".  She has thirty years experience in growing avocados, bananas and citrus fruits.  This experience helped her to acquire everything that she has now: a comfortable home, business premises in Puente Paucartambo (a commercial area), a home in the country's capital city and 40 hectares of farmland.  She has all of this thanks to her continual work.  \"I do business on the farm\", she comments very proudly.  \"Twice a week, I send large quantities of avocados to the capital\", she adds.\r\n\r\nJulia would now like to invest in growing coffee since its price on the market has increased.  She has already taken her first step by setting up coffee nurseries, where she has thousands of seedlings growing which will later be transplanted onto her farmland.  She also sells seedlings for 400 Peruvian soles per thousand to third parties which makes her extra money.\r\n\r\nJulia is a member of the \"Luz del Futuro\" (Light of the Future) community bank and this is her seventh loan from MFP.  She hopes that you will help fund her loan so that she can continue achieving her goals.  On her part, she pledges once again to make her loan repayments on time as she has with her previous loans.  Julia enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible people who are very supportive of each other.  With your support, Julia will invest the money she has requested in paying laborers to transplant her coffee seedlings onto her farmland."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":789113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire day laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-13T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":367.84},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":386.23},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":405.54},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":425.82},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":447.11},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":467.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.1},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.91},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.05},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.55},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.43},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":136.1,"local_amount":367.84,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":377,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550457},{"amount":142.91,"local_amount":386.23,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":395.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719137},{"amount":150.05,"local_amount":405.54,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":415.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350601},{"amount":157.55,"local_amount":425.82,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":436.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851041},{"amount":165.43,"local_amount":447.11,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:26Z","rounded_local_amount":458.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666201},{"amount":172.96,"local_amount":467.46,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":479.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621336}],"funded_date":"2011-06-13T21:09:05Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":310263,"name":"Wil Alfredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Will, tiene un taller de estructuras met\u00e1licas, vive con su esposa y dos hijas de 6 y 5 a\u00f1os de edad, solamente \u00e9l trabaja, \u00e9l aprendi\u00f3 en talleres y con experiencia instalo su propio negocio, tiene un horario de 8:00am a 4:00pm, su dificultad es el precio de la materia prima, pues constantemente suben los precios.\nActualmente necesita comprar hierro, lija, disco de pulidora, pliegos de l\u00e1mina, sierras y pintura, pues tiene un contrato pendiente por realizar, por lo que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que le ayude a realizar la compra y por medio de ella realizar su trabajo.\n\u00c9l quiere crecer en el taller, con m\u00e1s clientela y al mismo tiempo que su familia tenga una mejor condici\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica.\n","en":"Will owns a metal shop.

The good yield he realizes is in general due to the seeds he uses. His current seeds have already been used for 4 years and are beginning to lose their productivity and need to be renewed or replaced by new ones. However, the lack of investment capital is a current problem. For this, Mr. A. is asking for a loan of $800 to buy selected seeds and fertilizers to revitalize his business.

To reap the reward, Ni Nengah Sulasmi needs to wait patiently for another 2 or 3 months for the little cows to mature and ready to be marketed.  However, Ni Nengah Sulasmi is very enthusiastic about her business that she bought a share of a male cow to increase her farm's production.  Most of Sulasmi's time is spent on farming her cows and pigs.  She is fortunate that her eldest son that just finished high school starts helping in the farm by procuring grass for feeds.  Ni Nengah Sulasmi's livelihood is dependent on her far,.  Her husband works as a contract labor without steady income.  Ni Nengah Sulasmi is planning to purchase a male cow that she plans to farm for 5-6 month to maturity and then sell for profit.

You still have to guide them and act as both mother and father to them. This is the experience of Mrs. Corazon O., a 57-year-old widow who lives in the village of Tuburan, in the town of Pontevedra, Negros Occidental. Four of her five children have their own families and earn their own living. The youngest is 21 years old and still lives with her while she is attending college.\r\n\r\nCorazon has owned and managed a pottery business for more than 30 years. She has a loyal clientele that patronizes her business because they know she produces high quality pottery in designs and colors that are suited to their taste.  But being successful can sometimes create problems - good ones!  Because of the high demand for her products, she ran short on working capital.  She did not want to miss the opportunity to expand her business, and this is the reason why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 - to have access to additional capital when she has large orders that require a lot of raw materials.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her pottery business, she diversified and opened a cafeteria so that she could earn additional income. In the five years that she has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has maintained her good credit performance, and she earns on average a net profit of PHP5000 per month. Her last loan of PHP14000 was fully paid on time.  Now on her 9th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP15000 to infuse more working capital into her business ventures. Her main objective now is to have her youngest son graduate from college and start his own life. Corazon is also starting to save for herself so that she will not be a burden to her children when she grows old.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

Ambos tienen 7 hijos, todos ellos menores de edad. Que con mucho amor y cari\u00f1o lo educan en su casa propia, ubicada en la comunidad nativa Centro Huachirick (selva central peruana). En la comunidad nativa, Julio es muy respetado entre sus pobladores; su capacidad de palabra y su buen trato lo diferencian; pues \u00e9l se desempe\u00f1a como alba\u00f1il. La construcci\u00f3n de las casas de la comunidad es producto de su ingenio y responsabilidad. Pero como todo hombre del campo. Julio se dedica, hace 15 a\u00f1os a la agricultura. El cultivo de caf\u00e9, palta y pl\u00e1tanos, son su principal actividad; los fines de semana, de cada 15 d\u00edas, visita su platanal, ah\u00ed cosecha los pl\u00e1tanos que produce y los comercializa en el mercado central de la ciudad de Pichanki. Pero lo que m\u00e1s le gusta a Julio; es poder incursionar en la siembra intensiva, eso quiere decir; poder cosechar en mayores cantidades, por eso para m\u00e1s adelante est\u00e1 pensando adquirir m\u00e1s mamones (plantas peque\u00f1as de pl\u00e1tano). Es el tercer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, por eso en cada reuni\u00f3n con su banco comunal, demuestra puntualidad en sus cuotas, as\u00ed manifiesta el agradecimiento por su progreso. Con el cr\u00e9dito que solicita, podr\u00e1 adquirir 2 mil plantaciones de caf\u00e9, con lo que podr\u00e1 renovar sus plantaciones; los cuales cuidar\u00e1n dentro de 2 a 3 a\u00f1os para que den fruto.\n\n","en":"Julio, 44, cohabits with Benedicta, 42.  They have 7 minor children that they educate in their own home, located in the indigenous community of Centro Huachirik (Peruvian central jungle), with much love and affection.\r\n\r\nJulio is highly respected by the residents of the indigenous community due to his trustworthiness and good way of dealing with people.  He works as a bricklayer and the construction of houses in the community is product of his ingenuity and responsibility.\r\n\r\nHowever, like all men from the countryside, he\u2019s been a farmer for 15 years.  His main crops are coffee, avocado and bananas.  On the weekends every two weeks he visits his banana fields where he harvests the bananas he produces to sell in the city of Pichanki\u2019s central market.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She works purchasing and re-selling cows with her husband. She has three children. She would like to request a loan of 850 USD for the term of 9 months in order to purchase additional cows to increase her inventory and meet customer demand. She believes this will lead to greater revenue and, ultimately, greater profit for her family. In the future, she would like to reinvest the earnings generated by this loan back into her business to purchase additional cows and increase their income further. She plans to use the increased income to fund her children\u2019s education.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

wants to provide her daughter with financial security. She is a 43-year-old woman, living in the village of Brgy. Canggapas Anahaw, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. Melanie is married to Jose H., a truck driver who delivers sugarcane from the farm to the sugar mill. Driving a truck, in an industry that is known for its seasonality, cannot provide even a small family with a stable source of income. Even less, when the actual amount he receives for his labor is examined.\n\nWith no guaranteed income from her husband for part of the year to rely on for their family's needs, Melanie decided to earn her own living to supplement whatever income her husband earns and to provide their family with a more stable financial resource. When she was ready to start her business, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access a collateral-free loan it offers, and used it to set up a general store. \n\nAs her earnings grew, and her customer base expanded, she saw another opportunity for expansion - offering electronic reloading to prepaid mobile phone subscribers, many of whom were already patronizing her general store. With the fast turnover of her business she was able to increase her income. She now earns a monthly average of 7,000 pesos from her general store. Her industriousness has paid off:  she is happy to report that her daughter has graduated from college.\n\nIn her previous 16th loan cycle, she was able to borrow 19,000 pesos which was used as additional capital for her business. She paid back all of the weekly installments on time, keeping her good credit rating with NWT-Project Dungganon. She is planning to borrow 19,000 pesos for her 17th loan cycle to support her general store and electronic reloading business.\n\nAbout NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon!\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":395747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Despite her age, this is a very active and enterprising woman.  For the past 6 months she has risen early to prepare delicious fruit juices and fresh fruit extracts which she then distributes among her regular customers who, for the most part, are her neighbors.  For her, it is crucial to be able to offer a good product at a fair price since she is an honest woman who likes to do things always in the correct manner.  Besides, she believes this is a profitable business because she takes great pains to prepare juices that are her customers' favorites.\r\nIndalecia is a very hard working woman and she instilled this value into her children.  A few years ago she operated a toy store in her home but had to close due to personal reasons.  However, she dreams with being able to reopen it some day since she still owns almost all the equipment; her only lack is capital.  But, she has no shortage of will to work and get ahead.\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she assures us that she will be responsible with her repayment.  Among her immediate projects, and the reason she needs these funds, is to purchase modern juice extractors as well as natural dietary products to add to her breakfasts which she will offer in her toy store.  She smilingly states:  in future, to stay healthy, one must eat in Indalecia's toy store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":409691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase juicers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-20T00:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Indalecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":168.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843058},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:24Z","rounded_local_amount":168.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734634},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":168.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124041},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":168.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959717},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":168.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992564},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":166.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717350}],"funded_date":"2009-10-20T14:55:55Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":149757,"name":"Fadi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fadi has been working as a fisherman since 1999.

Misamis Occidental. She is 48 years old. Carmelita is married and has one adult child. To make a living, Carmelita raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Carmelita has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 6,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Carmelita joined GDMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carmelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. Carmelita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be the second loan taken out by Carmelita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

When he started his own family he didn't waste any time in looking for an honourable way to maintain it. In this way William learnt to drive and 4 years ago started work offering a taxi service. At the beginning he used a rented car, but a year ago was able to buy his own car. William likes his job very much, as he is the boss of his time and works peacefully, especially in rush hour (the greatest demand and traffic) when there are more people that require his services. William is very satisfied because his work generates very good earnings that allow him to give his family a good quality of life. As he is a young man with a great desire to move forward, in the future he plans to buy another car and rent it out to generate more earnings.  \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan he has had with MFP and he is very thankful for all the people that have made it possible for him to obtain the loan to continue his progress. William plans to invest the money he is seeking in a technical revision (government mandated) of his car, which he must comply with as the law stipulates so he can continue working without a problem. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":493804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Technical assessment of car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-23T06:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":152.91},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":157.29},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":163.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":169.65},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":175.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":181.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.52},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.05},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.32},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.52,"local_amount":152.91,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":153.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993290},{"amount":55.05,"local_amount":157.29,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":158.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718073},{"amount":57.35,"local_amount":163.86,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":164.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751748},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":169.65,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":170.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934210},{"amount":61.32,"local_amount":175.2,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":176.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672985},{"amount":63.38,"local_amount":181.09,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":182.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886782}],"funded_date":"2010-02-26T09:48:11Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":183249,"name":"Codou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Codou G. est une femme de 41 ans, mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 7 enfants.

In addition to her clothing business, she makes prepared meals at weekends that she also sells from her house and raises and slaughters pigs.  She started the clothing business while working at a job in a free-trade zone, first selling clothing to co-workers and then going on to selling full-time when she found that it was profitable.

For more than 18 years he has been involved in agricultural activities. He hires workers to work the land and finds help from his family with handling the money produced from the sales. \r\n\r\nLately, Nazirdjon has expanded into raising livestock, which he also sells. He buys young cattle and cows, and when they are grown and heavy, he sells them. The only thing that Nazirdjon is suffering from now is the lack of water and that is the reason that he applied to IMON for purchasing necessary materials to make a borehole. \r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Nazirdjon has requested a loan through IMON International; he has good references from his neighbors who consider him a responsible person.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has been practicing mixed farming for the last four years. His farm produces maize, beans, tea and milk, which he sells locally. He is also employed as a teacher. His biggest challenges in farming have been diseases and pests that attack his crops and animals, an inadequate market and high competition.\r\n\r\nEvans is 30 years old. He is married with three children who are now between the ages of 2 and 10.

It was a hard blow to her, but Arzykan had to get it together and move forward. \r\n\r\nArzykan started selling vegetables at a local market. Her start as an entrepreneur was successful, but she handed the business over to her daughter whose own family was in need.\r\n\r\nAt that point, Arzykan decided to start her own business in cattle-breeding.  Using her initial capital of 15,000 KGS, she bought milch cows and started to sell milk.  Due to strong efforts, Arzykan has developed her farm and today she has two milch cows and 19 sheep.  Arzykan intends to use the loan of 60,000 KGS to broaden her business by purchasing one milch cow, which will allow her to sell more milk, and one horse.  \r\n\r\nIn future, Arzykan plans to hold her son\u2019s marriage and prepare a cozy home for his future family. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

So 15 years ago Maria Feliciana decided to work to help her husband with the household expenses, and above all the education of her children. She started selling tamales and other food, along with shoes. She had to travel to another city where she could buy good quality shoes cheaply, along with curtains and blankets, and in this way offer good prices to her customers. Little by little she got ahead. Today her children are married, but Maria Feliciana has not lost the taste for work, and she now dedicates herself to the sale of health products.\r\n\r\n<p>Maria Feliciana is requesting a loan for $375 to buy a new product put out by the company that supplies her health products. It is a weight-loss product. She will repay the loan over a period of 6 to 12 months, since with this new product she hopes to have many customers.

mobile stand in Aregua, Paraguay. One day he decided to purchase two packages of socks and sell these along with the strawberries. He was able to sell all of the socks by mid-day. Due to his success in selling the socks he decided to take out a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya to buy more merchandise. Octaviano bought: wallets, t-shirts, cell phone cases, watch batteries and of course, more socks. Now, Octaviano is thinking about further expanding his stock.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his family in his own house.  He cultivates coffee plants, pineapples and bananas on his own farmlands.  Of all the products, the most difficult one is the pineapple which must be worked for 9 months, fertilized and fumigated, because in times of reaping it can be harvested up to three times.  Because of that, Gencys doesn't find it tiring no matter how much work it entails.  With this harvest, added to the coffee gleaning, his family does not suffer economic hardships so he is thinking about increasing his plantings as well as perhaps going into motorcycle sales because in his town mobility is lacking.  With his first loan he was able to plant pineapple on his farmland and with this second loan he wants to fortify the soil and he promisses to repay on time as he's always done to date.

To support her children she has always worked by knitting, and currently they are the ones that work and cover the expenses of the home. However, Margarita keeps knitting because it is her pastime and she can't stop doing the activity she loves so much. Since she already has regular customers, she constantly gets orders for covers, blankets, sweaters, etc. which she knits with a lot of creativity and that generate financial gain since she purchases wool in bulk and knits very quickly. This working woman does not rest during the weekend; on the contrary, she is devoted to selling ceviche (typical dish made of fish) and picarones (a dessert) in a small table that she sets outside her home. She does well because she puts in a lot of effort to succeed.

Then at 5:00 pm, she starts to fry the kabobs and sells them until 11:00 pm, hoping that she will sell all the food that she has prepared.<p>\r\nRosal\u00eda is satisfied with what she does because she shares her profits with her husband, who does not earn enough money to support the household because he is a driver. Their greatest wish is to improve their home. This is her first loan with MFP, and she is committed to making her payments on time and participating in the group meetings. With this loan that she is now requesting, she will purchase tables and chairs to expand her business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":511587,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase tables and chairs to expand her food stand","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-24T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":167.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993388},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":167.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718189},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":167.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751864},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":167.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934324},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:00Z","rounded_local_amount":167.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673091},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":165.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886921}],"funded_date":"2010-03-26T01:00:51Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":191479,"name":"Mar\u00eda Deysi","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Deysi Maril\u00fa B. de 43 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en Santa Tecla, una hermosa ciudad ubicada en el departamento de La Libertad.

The most important thing about this process is that it is the smoke, not the fire, that cooks the fish. The smoke gives the fish its dark color. Green leaves are used as coverings for the fish to prevent the smoke from escaping into the air.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b><br>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 30, and she is very devoted to her business.  For the moment she lives with her life partner and son in her mother\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nShe has had a convenience store for seven years.  She set it up in her current house.  Betty cleans and arranges the products in her store starting at six in the morning.  She also prepares the condiments that she sells ground.

That is why she works so hard all of the time for her store to look good.  This attracts the neighbors\u2019 attention.  She generally works alone because her husband works in transportation with his \u201cmotocarro\u201d (three wheeled motor vehicle).\r\n\r\nThis year both of them have proposed saving money to buy a piece of land where they can build their own house for their son\u2019s well-being.\r\n\r\nThis is the third time that she has had a loan with MFP.

Victoria 3 (Road to victory). She makes her home in a simple structure with her long-term partner and three children. She says that her most difficult challenges are to build her house and to give a better life to her family. In the meantime, she plans to continue to enjoy cooking.\n\nLuisa is excited to be taking her first loan, with which she will start her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying miscellaneous products, especially clothing and underwear. She will use the profits to buy school supplies for her children and to invest more in her business.\n\nLuisa is dreaming of having her own home and, thanks to her business and to Esperanza loans, she wishes that her dream will become reality.\n\nThis associate began with Esperanza because she wanted to go forward with starting her business and be in a program like Esperanza offers. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti).\n\nHer group is located in Santiago, the second biggest city in the Dominican Republic, and an area famous for its tobacco and beef production. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable electricity and running water (none of which is potable).\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":578826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is married with one son and has been in business for nine years. She is an energetic, enthusiastic entrepreneur who operates her business simply but wisely. An example of this is times when she has needed to purchase new clothing inventory. Rather than close her business and travel herself to buy inventory, she has paid other clothing vendors to buy for her so that she can stay and keep her business open. \r\n\r\nDilorom has requested a loan to help renew her supply of clothing inventory. This loan will help her purchase a good supply of clothing to sell so she can maximize her profits and continue working to develop her business. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his partner, Julia, who is a housewife,  and their two children, ages 8 and 5, whom he loves very much, in the house of his parents. Jos\u00e9's business is transporting passengers in his three-wheeled vehicle, known as a mototaxi, with which he travels through all the streets of the city, both in and away from the center, transporting his passengers to their destinations. He has been doing this work for more than three years. At first he had a mototaxi that he bought through a rent-to-own plan. Now he likes his business since it generates an income with which he can pay the expenses to feed his family and help the finances in his parents' home, and also because he can manage his working hours. In contrast, he doesn't like it when it rains for a long time, since it is difficult to be able to do his work, since it's bad for his vehicle. On the other hand, he wants to be able to open a store in his parents' house, which his partner can tend to. In this way he will have an extra income. \r\n\r\nThis will be his fifth loan with MFP. He feels thankful for the financial support to advance in his business, and he promises to be punctual in making his payments, as he did with his previous loans. On the other hand, he says that he feels good about his communal bank since he considers its members to be people who are responsible and united. With the 2000 PEN he has applied for, he will invest in the wholesale purchase of groceries to set up a new business, a grocery store in his parents' house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":938861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

He has had the business for five years, having started because he had some friends who advised him that this type of enterprise would help him generate enough income to support his family.  Juan\u2019s intention is to purchase more pigs during this season, as they serve various functions.  For this reason, the financing is to provide him with working capital designed to purchase spare parts for his trailer.  The trailer also helps him with the transport of the pigs.  Finally, his wishes are to maintain the business since it earns him extra income that allows him to provide additional comforts for his family. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":269366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-25T13:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Francisco ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:34:57Z","rounded_local_amount":503.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092068},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":503.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985450},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":503.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446066},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":503.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956703},{"amount":150,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-19T08:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3022.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174125}],"funded_date":"2009-02-25T16:20:57Z","paid_date":"2009-08-19T08:57:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":92332,"name":"Ni Ketut Sudantri","description":{"languages":["id","en"],"texts":{"id":"Dari Pinjaman periode yang pertama yang telah diterima oleh Ni ketut Sudantri dan yang sudah dipergunakan untuk membeli anakan babi dan induk babi.Hasil yang didapat dari usaha ini cukup baik karena Ni Ketut Sidantri melakukan segala petunjuk cara pemeliharaan babi yang  bimbingan oleh dokter Hewan dan pembina dari DINARI.

She lives with her husband in their home. Her enterprising nature pushed her to tackle various jobs with her husband, and after some time, they purchased their first car. Her husband drives the vehicle, while she manages it. From the profits they earned, they were able to buy their \"motocarro\" (a three-wheeled, light delivery van), with which their older son works. Maritza is a very thrifty woman, but at the same time, she loves working. For that reason, she began to work as a cook in a convent, from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., while continuing to manage their vehicles.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Estrella has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP when she sells her raised pigs.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Estrella joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Estrella has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. Estrella is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Estrella from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

She earns her living by operating a fishing business. Her husband Emelio R., who is 37 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have ten children who are between 8 and 30 years old. \r\n\r\nMilagros joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 5,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $100, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 3rd cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for the purchase of pump boat materials so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Milagros R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned their respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our team.
