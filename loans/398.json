Vista Alegre, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 24 years old, married, and has two infants. To make a living, Noli Christopher owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling scrap metal and other used products in the local community. Noli Christopher has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Noli Christopher joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Noli Christopher has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Noli Christopher is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offerings. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Noli Christopher from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherpeople, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":618934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase new items to expand product offerings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.

Now she has a very large grocery store with many customers who she supplies with all sorts of products.  Hers is one of the most complete grocery stores around and she sells market-place items, groceries and licquor.  She offers her customers goods on credit which enables her to keep her customers happy.  Soon she is planning to extend her house and turn the whole first floor into a minimarket.

She is 33 years old.  Jean is widowed and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, Jean owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, junk foods and breads in the local community.  Jean has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 12,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jean joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jean has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI.  This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital.  Jean is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods and biscuits.  This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Jean from HSPFI.

For the past 2 years, he has been a local producer of packaging materials. Josiah is a young man with a vision to serve humanity with his talent and skills, and he dreams of a well-established company of his own that would produce bulk packaging materials to serve all kinds of purposes. He produces and supplies his packaging materials to food vendors, market sellers, and super market operators so that they can wrap their customers' purchased items. <p>\r\n\r\nHowever, Josiah is constrained by inadequate capital, so he is unable to generate his packaging materials on a large scale to meet the demands of his customers.

Sr., or \u201cBoy\u201d as he is known in his village, is 58 years old. He only finished elementary education. Due to hardships, he was unable to pursue his studies. Instead, he helped his father cultivate their farm lot by planting rice and some vegetables. When he was 18, his uncle, who is a mechanic, hired him to be a conductor and collector in his jeepney. At the same time, he taught him how to drive and how to repair the jeepney; after a year, he could perform both tasks with ease.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, Domingo decided that he wanted to purchase his own jeepney so that he could apply what he had learned from his uncle. From that time onwards, he tried to save more of his income; after three years, he bought his own jeepney, which he used to earn income. \r\n\r\nDomingo is married to Teresita P.; they are gifted with five children. They want their children to finish their studies so that they will find stable jobs someday. Consequently, they are doing their best to earn money with which they can support the studies of their children. His wife is engaged in selling snacks in the school campus. \r\n\r\nAs a result of their patience and sacrifices, they are able to earn an income of P 8,000 per month, which they use to meet their daily needs and finance the schooling of their children. Due to the high cost of commodities and school expenditures, however, they need to earn more income to meet their needs. Domingo thus wants to borrow P 5,000 from Kiva lenders for the maintenance of his jeepney.

She is married and her husband is a farmer.  They have 5 children: 4 are married adults who live on their own.  The youngest lives with his parents helping them with household tasks and the farm.   They have been growing pitahaya (dragon fruit), pineapple and bananas for the past 15 years.  The main problem facing them has been the lack of capital to be able to improve the crops.  Coupled with this last year the family had the tremendous misfortune of losing a son.  This family tragedy led to a series of big expenses to cover.  They had to manage these expenses with their savings that they were going to use to invest in the business.  That is why they are asking for a loan-to take care of their crops with the purchase of fertilizers.  This will improve their economic situation and help them repay the loan, and will generate the means for new family projects.\r\nThey have been a very humble and responsible family over the years-their community will confirm this.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":474032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-21T02:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maura Katalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.16,"local_amount":3.15,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841718},{"amount":199.84,"local_amount":3996.85,"processed_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4175.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770591}],"funded_date":"2010-01-21T05:02:23Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":174276,"name":"Cynthia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cynthia H. is a 44-year-old married woman who lives in Pob 1, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by selling dressed chicken and frozen food products. Cynthia\u2019s husband Ruel works, but also helps her in running the business. They have four school-age children.\n\nCynthia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by selling dressed chicken and frozen food products. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000 from her business activities.\n\nCynthia is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 was used to fund operations of her dressed chicken and frozen food products business. It had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 11th loan in the amount of  PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to sustain her dressed chicken and frozen food products business.

Faigame needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Faigame joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faigame's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faigame Isara P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: \n\nTo maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Ritah is 20 years old and lives in the town of Nansana in the Kampala East region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. Ritah has a business selling secondhand clothes, a business she has had for less than a year.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Ritah is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes to sell and will also help her pay her rent. She plans to use the loan in order to gain more customers and generate profit in order to help her family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Ritah hopes to have a big boutique of her own.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders:<\/b>\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva that funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.\r\n\r\nThe ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.\r\n\r\nKiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in micro-finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":577462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

Hace a\u00f1os realiz\u00f3 otro pr\u00e9stamo en El Banco Nacional de Costa Rica pero FUDECOSUR le brind\u00f3 el pr\u00e9stamo con mayores facilidades y a una tasa de inter\u00e9s mas baja.","en":"Miguel is a humble gentleman who is 62 years old.

Among other challenges, she has also had difficulties with inadequate capital to expand her business. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans to buy more clothes, thread, foodstuff like beans, rice, tomato, onion, garlic, maggi, sugar, and cassava flakes commonly known as garri.  She thinks her business will succeed because her business site is close to the road and she is friendly, thus has many clients. She has minimized risk by diversifying her business. Her activity will help her community in reducing the cost of transportation to buy foodstuff, and their cordial relationship will allow for negotiation to pay later.\r\n\r\nShe will use a fraction of her profit to assist her husband to provide for the children\u2019s school needs, to meet her personal needs, and to feed her family. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow-up and moral support given her by the GHAPE office, and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

They live in Oepura Village. From the marriage, Jeane is blessed with 6 children and they are: Novi, Ivon, Melky, Mersi, Rolland and Andre. Five of the children work but still live with Jeane and Alexander. Jeane does not want to lean on her children's income even though they are willing to support their parents' needs.\r\n\r\nJeane is a successful woman in running her business. She initiated her business by selling mobile phone recharges with her own capital. She created a simple counter to sell the mobile phone recharges at her house. Unfortunately, she only generated small income about IDR 30,000 \u2013 50,000\/day. She is now interested in running a kiosk business using the capital, but she needs more capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nJeane has been with the TLM group lending program for 3 cycles. She heard from her friend that TLM provided loans for entrepreneurs like her. Her previous loans were invested to buy her kiosk business stock. She has a good credit history under the group loan program. She plans to expand her business by purchasing more stock to sell in her kiosk. She is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 4,000,000 from TLM through the individual lending program. She hopes that TLM is willing to assist her by providing the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":675124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

C., a 61-year-old widow, native of the District of Matutuine, in the south of the province of Maputo, has 8 children and 6 grandchildren, grew up in the Swiss Mission church and was not able to attend school due to the differences between the colonial government and the church.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the death of her husband, who was a fisherman, 6 years ago from an illness, she has gone through many difficulties because the reserve of savings was used to take care of the hospital expenses of her late husband.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the death of her husband, with a group of 12 members under her care, she had no choice but to continue the work her late husband did, even though the equipment was in a precarious state and the sea was polluted by the Greek petroleum ship, Katina P. \r\n<p>\r\nEven with these problems, she met the challenge, and with her youngest son who, at the time was 14, started the work up again, with him as captain of the ship.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2001, she found out about the Microfinance Institution called Hluvuku-Adsema, which operated around 45 km from where she was, so she went there and requested a loan to acquire and rehabilitate fishing equipment. This was accepted and she also benefitted from training on business management. With this loan, she was able to revitalize the microbusiness, and several others followed to maintain and expand the business, totalling 6 loans in all. Given her low level of schooling, she has received continuous monitoring from the Hluvuku-Adsema staff in order to generate more business and ensure the repayment of the loans. This work won her 3rd place in the Global Micro-Businessperson Contest held in Mozambique in 2004, during the commemorations of the International Year of Microcredit.\r\n<p>\r\nShe currently has a motor boat and 8 permanent workers. With a loan of 20,000 meticais, she plans to buy more fishing nets in order to increase her production capacity, create more jobs - it should be 4 more seasonal workers - as well as buy a freezer with 270 L capacity to be able to better preserve the fishing products.\r\n<p>\r\nHer activity has a greater impact on the life of the community because, in addition to generating more jobs for the people who work directly with fishing, she creates more jobs for the people who acquire the product to later resell it. She also contributes to a continuous supply of a range of seafood to the city of Maputo, greatly contributing to improve the population\\'s diet.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nThe original business description in Portuguese is below:<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nLocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o: Catembe, Maputo, Mo\u00e7ambique\r\n\r\nCliente: Marta C.\r\n\r\nSector de Actividade Pesca\r\n\r\nValor de Empr\u00e9stimo: 20.000,00 Mtn  (769 US$)\r\n\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o do empr\u00e9stimo: compra de redes pesca e sistema de frio( congelador)\r\n\r\nInicio - 14\/11\/2006\r\n\r\nFim \u2013 06\/05\/2008\r\nMarta C., vi\u00fava de 61 anos de idade, natural do Distrito de Matutuine, sul da prov\u00edncia de Maputo tem 8 filhos e 6 netos, cresceu na igreja da Miss\u00e3o \u2013Sui\u00e7a e n\u00e3o conseguiu frequentar a escola divido as diverg\u00eancia  entre o governo colonial e a igreja.<p>\r\nDepois da morte do Marido que era pescador \u00e0 6 anos v\u00edtima de doen\u00e7a atravessou muitas dificuldades porque a reserva das economias  foram usadas para custear as despesas de hospitalares do falecido.<p>\r\nDesde a morte do marido e com um agregado de 12 membros sob a sua responsabilidade, n\u00e3o tinha alternativa para a continuidade da actividade que o falecido marido exercia uma vez que para alem do estado prec\u00e1rio em os equipamento se encontravam, o mar estava polu\u00eddo pelo petroleiro grego \u201cKatina P\u201d.<p>\r\nMesmo com estas dificuldades desafiou a situa\u00e7\u00e3o e com o filho mais novo que na altura tinha 14 anos reiniciaram a actividade, este como capit\u00e3o da embarca\u00e7\u00e3o.<p>\r\nNo ano de 2001, teve informa\u00e7\u00f5es da exist\u00eancia de uma institui\u00e7\u00e3o Micro-financeira denominada Hluvuku-Adsema, que operava a cerca de 45km da sua localidade tendo se deslocado para l\u00e1 e solicitou  um empr\u00e9stimo para aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o e reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de equipamento de pesca, o qual foi aceite e tamb\u00e9m beneficiou-se de forma\u00e7\u00e3o  sobre gest\u00e3o de neg\u00f3cio.

Ariel reci\u00e9n se caso hace solo unos meses y viven en casa de su madre, puesto que aun no tienen  dinero para una casa propia. En esta casa es donde tiene 4 vacas lecheras que fueron la herencia que le dio su mama cuando el cumpli\u00f3 los 18 a\u00f1os.\n\nAriel se dedica a la cr\u00eda de ganado lechero mejorado, que es un trabajo que su familia hace desde hace muchas generaciones. Gracias al buen manejo del ganado la peque\u00f1a granja que tiene es conocida en la zona por la buena calidad de la leche que produce. Ahora que tiene el apoyo de su esposa Ariel asiste a un instituto en las noches para aprender mec\u00e1nica automotriz y as\u00ed poder alg\u00fan d\u00eda abrir un taller mec\u00e1nico.  \n\nEl cr\u00e9dito ser\u00e1 utilizado para construir corrales para alojar ganado. Esta es la \u00e9poca donde empiezan las lluvias en la ciudad de Cochabamba y es un problema para las vacas cuando no tienen refugio, por esa raz\u00f3n es que Ariel quiere construir los Corrales para que sus vacas no sufran las tempestades de la lluvia. Al tener un refugio las vacas no tendr\u00e1n problemas de ninguna \u00edndole y por ende no bajaran su producci\u00f3n de leche, entonces los ingresos de Ariel no disminuir\u00e1n. El mayor sue\u00f1o de Ariel es hacer crecer su granja lechera y abrir una mec\u00e1nica automotriz que es un hobby que a \u00e9l le gusta mucho.\n","en":"Ariel P. C. is 28.  He lives in the Maica Chica area south of the city of Cochabamba.  Ariel got married a few months ago.  They live in his mother\u2019s house because they do not have enough money for their own house.  At this house he has the four dairy cows that were an inheritance his mother gave him when he turned 18.\r\n\r\nAriel raises dairy cows.  It is work that has been in his family for many generations.  Thanks to good cattle management, their small farm is well known in the area for the good quality of milk it produces.  Now that he has help from his wife, Ariel goes to an institution in the evenings to learn auto mechanics.  That way he will one day be able to open a mechanic\u2019s shop.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to build corrals to house the cattle.  This is the season when the rains start in the city of Cochabamba.  It is a problem for the cows when they do not have refuge.  That is why Ariel wants to build the corrals, so that the cows do not suffer from the rain storms.  By having a refuge, the cows will not have any problems.  Therefore, milk production will not decrease.  \r\n\r\nAriel\u2019s dream is to make his dairy farm grow and to open an auto mechanic shop, which is a hobby that he really likes.\r\n\r\n<br

Through her hard work and determination in running a business to help her husband support the education of their children until they graduated from college, all the children are now professionals. However, Erlinda is not free of her financial obligations to her children because they have their own families to take care of.  Therefore, she joined Kiva partner ASHI to have access to credit which she will use to grow a business which she has been nurturing for a long time. With the help of her farmer husband, Erlinda plans to purchase additional cattle which she will raise with her existing cattle in her selling and breeding business. Through ASHI she is requesting a loan and Erlinda has the courage to invest the loan in her business because she has much experience in this field. She knows that once the cattle are sold, profits can as much as double from the initial investment.  She negotiates, supported by her husband, with potential buyers in different municipalities during market days. On these days, people from different municipalities also come to buy other commodities being sold. \r\n<p>\r\nErlinda\u2019s intention of making her business successful is not only for herself but for her grandchildren as well. She wants to make her grandchildren happy by supporting their financial needs if their parents have problems to do so.

Life in the Dominican Republic can be rough; they do not have potable running water, there are frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and the health care is inadequate.

With her profits, she also hopes to one day build her own home. Altagracia looks forward to sending her children to college someday, an opportunity she did not have as a young adult. This will give her children a step up in society and allow them to pursue any career that they choose.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope.

of Uganda.  She is single and has five children, all of whom are  currently in school.  She has had a business for two years, running a small restaurant where she sells cooked food.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hellen is requesting a loan of 150,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy more supplies to be used in the restaurant, like cups, plates and saucepans.  The additional supplies will allow her business to serve more customers, and to generate more profit in order to support her family.  In the future, Hellen hopes to educate her children up to university and to start a business raising chickens.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in micro-finance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":577473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband Isaac, who is 42 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are between 5 and 21 years old. Marjorie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 23 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marjorie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 24th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future house improvements. Marjorie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

From it, she earns 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nAs a GDMPC member, Marcelina has enjoyed the privileges granted by the organization to its qualified members. The cooperative allowed her to borrow 5,000 PHP which she will use to purchase rice and corn grits to sell in the community. She hopes that this investment will make sense and help improve her business operations. The revenue will be used to buy fertilizers for the farm cultivated by her spouse and to buy more stock for the store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":855831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

They live in the land of butifarras, the typical artisan sausages of Soledad, fifteen minutes from the city of Barranquilla, where she earns her living as a vendor.  She started her business ten years ago while working as a sales rep.  She saved her salary and commissions so she could make small investments, which now provide very significant support to her and her husband in looking after their family.\r\n\r\nAt first she had only two display cases and a stock of cosmetics, but she gradually added stationery and women's accessories.  Now she has five displays and sells clothing, plastic goods, and disposables as well from a corner of her family's house.

has a farm where he grows rice and raises cattle. He lives with his wife, his grandparents and his children. He has two kids, a 16-year-old son and an infant daughter. His son helps him on the farm while also going to school. He wants to use the loan to prepare his lands for the upcoming planting season. In the future, he wants to improve his home by making it out of cement, as it is currently out of wood and is not in the best condition. <\/p> \r\n<p>He is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserves for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water basins that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the freshwater Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to sell them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in a rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security.

Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. \r\n\r\nFirst, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals?

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 32 years old and had to drop school before finishing 5th grade, when his father passed away and he had to start working to help support his family. He lives with his wife and children aged 2, 5 and 6, and all of them go to school.\r\n\r\nHe has never left the city and he works with agriculture and owns a machamba (a large garden where crops are grown that provide most all the food for the people in the villages). He's been working since 1995 and has 3 employees, who work 8 hours a day. He got his work experience from working in a farm prior to that. His favorite vegetable is cabbage, which he grows in a 80km2 (80 square kilometers), and spending up to 35.000,00MT (U$1,275) each harvest, and making back around 65.000,00MT (U$2,365). Adding to that the other cultures, he's able to make up to 85.000,00MT (U$3,100) at the end of each harvest, which allows him to save some money. \r\n\r\nThis is Flavio's 4th loan with Hluvuku in the amount of 23.000,00MT (U$850) to buy agricultural consumables (seeds, fertilizers, soil preparation) and also to pay his employees. He faces tough challenges like plagues, burglary and the lack of transportation for yielding. The other loans were paid in time and were all used for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nIn order to guarantee his children proper food and education, he feels that he needs to keep investing in this business, as it is what he's good at. He plans on taking another loan in the future to buy a car to help with the business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

She is 42 years old. Pacita is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Pacita owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as milo, nestea juice, coffeemate, coffee, shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Pacita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Pacita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Pacita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Pacita is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Pacita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She retails the products at the great market in Bougouni, for cash or credit, to a clientele mostly made up of women.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, Adiara expects to make an average profit of 17,500 CFA francs a month.

is a cattle rancher from Salitre. He wants to invest the money he receives from the loan in pesticides for rice and raising pigs. He commercializes the rice and pigs himself by traveling and selling to the nearby city of Milagro. He has one son who is in school. He wants to buy a truck in the future with the extra money he makes. He also hopes he can continue to provide an education for his 15 year old son. <\/p>\r\n<p>He is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas, known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy), with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices, and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farm rice and invest in pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-18T00:44:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ernesto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-04T05:50:17Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-12T22:22:06Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31429},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:20:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40403},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T19:48:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53269},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-29T23:17:40Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73628},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T00:33:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88531},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:42:26Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99027}],"funded_date":"2007-05-21T05:50:17Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:42:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14160,"name":"Thuy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Thuy S. and her husband are farmers in Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia.

Zebi Amonovna is selling children's clothing for the past 16 years. She is married and has five children. After the collapse of the Soviet Union (USSR) she and her husband lost their jobs. Her husband is currently unemployed. Zebi had to start selling on the market to feed her family. Her older son was also helping her. As her children grew older her income was not enough. Her older son had to go to Russia to find work. He was sending home US$100 a month, but it was still not enough. In the early 2006 Zebi obtained a loan to expand her business. She started buying merchandise in large quantities (wholesale) for a lower price and selling it retail or semi-wholesale. Her younger son, Zubaidullo is helping her with the business. Zebi wants to be more competitive and intends to travel to Bishkek, the Republic of Kyrgyztan, herself to purchase merchandise which will allow her to start selling wholesale.\r\n<p> <b>Translated

After the death of his father, Kalifa quickly had to give up his scholling and became an apprentice tailor in Sikasso and then in Bamako in order to help his mother take care of his younger siblings. Following a 6-year apprenticeship, he became a well-known master tailor  in Sikasso with customers from all social classes. His workshop already has 2 machines, and is located at Bougoula-Ville, a very busy capital region of the third administrative area of Mali. In order to face the growing demands from his customers, he has decided to take part in the Soro Yiriwaso program, and this is his first individual loan. He would like to buy one (1) sewing machine in Bamako to supplement his existing equipment. With this machine he plans to increase his monthly income by 120.000 FCFA, with which he would like to further build workshop, to help with his family's needs and pay the interest on his loan.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is starting a business venture,  which is flower garden.  Metuli needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchse additional garden equipments.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Metuli joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Metuli's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Metuli Maliota are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Today, he transports people throughout his town and the surrounding local area. He previously operated between his province and the surrounding cities. However, a bus service was installed, which cut into his profits. This caused him to make the change to becoming a local driver. Bayrmagnai is a well experienced driver and has good communication skills. His business is very important to him because it is the only source of income for his family. Bayrmagnai is focused on the future and says, \"I would like to stabilize my business and will work hard to pay back my loan in full.\" He is requesting a 1,500,000 tugrug (~ 1,100 USD) loan to

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is a very resourceful mother whose hard work brings a livelihood to the family. Comfort supports herself through the sale of used clothing and bed sheets. Selling of used clothing and bed sheets has a very big market share in Ghana, as brand new clothes are very expensive for the economically active poor. She has been in this business for the past 30 years. She travels to a nearby city called Accra to purchase her stock of goods. She wants to use the loan to buy more bales of used clothing to increase her inventory. She normally concentrates on kid\u2019s wear, bed sheets and used towel sales.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":369386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more common household goods for reselling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-14T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Huruma E.

He is married and he is the father of 3 children, still in his care. He has become the best autobody specialist because he has been in this occupation since 1994. Therefore as an experienced veteran in the field he opened his shop, located in the district of Ablogame in the city of Lome. He has many loyal customers that appreciate the work well-done. He also has a number of apprenticeships, given that many parents want their children to become like him. He currently requires a new painting tool, which is why he is requesting a loan from Wages (Kiva Field Partner). The loan will also be used to expand and improve his general auto mechanic workshop.

He is 38 years old, married and the father of 3 children, who are 8, 5, and 3 years old.  His oldest child attends school.  Armando went to school up until his 3rd year of the Industrial Institute, but stopped his studies because he had to work in order to support his family.  He lives in his own home and is not financially responsible for anyone except his immediate family.  He left Chimoio for Boane in 1999 when he was transferred with the [military] service.  A short time after that he built his own home where he still lives with his family. He is an employee of Mozambique Electricity company where he works as an electrician.  He has worked there for 8 years, for 8 hours a day from Monday through Friday.  He learned how to do this work in Chimoio in 1998.  His monthly salary is 7.465,00mt and he is able to save a little each month.  He has never had a loan with any other financial institution and this is his first loan with Hluvuku, for 15.000,00mt.  He will use the money to buy sand, cement, steel, rocks and other building materials to finish his project.  He heard about Hluvuku because he lives next to the Boane branch.  He is committed to paying his loan off on-time in order to qualify for other loans to furnish his home and to open a business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Rachel Crouch, Kiva

She doesn\u2019t pay rent for business premises because she sells from her home. She works in a semi urban area which is in the outskirts of Kampala. She works seven days a week. She receives an average of thirty customers a day and sells to all categories of people both on retail and wholesale. Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding the family and school fees for her children. Her major business challenges are transportation and seasonality. She has been in this business for six years and with MCDT for ten years servicing her twentieth loan, working with the same group mates. Resty joined MCDT because it was near her home and was working with poor women. She wants to use this loan to buy more sacks of charcoal for use during the festive season. She aspires to see her business grower bigger and starts selling on wholesale only and also going directly to

She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her rug-making business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for an 8,000 PHP loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying supplies needed to continue production of her rugs, like fabric, thread and so on.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow. She hopes to have more patrons and loyal customers\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Together they live in a modest house in a quiet zone of the central sierra of Peru. She works in agriculture because she says it is what she knows how to do best. She learned how to do it by observing her relatives and neighbors in the community. Currently she works together with her husband growing potatoes, peas and corn. Although the farming work is self-sacrificing because you have to get up early every day to care for the crops in order to ensure a good production, she says that during the harvest she gets her reward. Since the better you care for your crops the better the products they will produce. Because her natural products are good quality, she has regular customers in the largest market in the city and from the sales she gets regular profits, which allows her to give her family an appropriate quality of life. For the future she plans to plant larger plots of land. She also wants to buy some heads of cattle to raise and have for whatever difficulty that may arise. This is her third loan with MFP and she is very thankful to all the people who made the loan possible as it will allow her to continue working in search of progress. Also, she says that she is satisfied with the performance of her communal group because all the members are very responsible with making their payments. Yolanda plans to invest the requested loan in buying bags of various fertilizers that she needs to improve the productivity of her crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Fanning, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":586239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy bags of fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-19T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1539.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463119}],"funded_date":"2010-08-20T00:58:34Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Fanning","image":null}},{"id":228075,"name":"Jenifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenifer N. is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kasubi, in the Kampala region of Uganda.

Saijalol is a very happy and sociable 56-year-old man. He says he is a happily married man with a hard-working woman who has supported him in achieving all of his dreams. They have ten children and they would have liked to have more. Saijalol\u2019s family is one that loves working in agriculture. The whole family works together to harvest different vegetables. It has been six years since Saijalol began working the land he loves so much. His wife sells the products in the local market. Saijalol also earns some extra income by breeding cattle.\r\n\r\nSaijalol is requesting a loan to acquire agricultural supplies that are necessary to maintain the crops. With part of the loan he will also buy young cattle.  His dream is that his children inherit the love to work the land that he and his wife acquired with great effort, and that some day their children will inherit.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In most cases, she purchases the fish she sells from fishermen who bring their catch to Lugazi town.\r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge has been the fact that she has to sell her fish while moving. This, she says, has stifled the growth of her business as some of her clients are not easily accessible. She has to spend money every day to reach some of them and some of these clients reside in far off places. This, needless to say, has played havoc with the consolidation of her finances.\r\n\r\nShe says this business's gross profits total up to UGX 50,000 weekly.\r\n\r\nSarah says this Kiva loan is to help her construct a permanent stall from which she can sell her fish."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":816375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To construct a permanent fishing-selling stall.
