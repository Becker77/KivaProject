Adwoa\u2019s husband is a mason by profession. She lives with the family in her brothers\u2019 house in a town called Dormaa Ahenkro in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. Dormaa is an agricultural-dominated town. It is about a 45 minute drive from Sunyani, the regional capital. Adwoa trades in fresh yams and crates of eggs to make some income.

It is for this reason that this lady decided to begin selling second-hand clothing. She walks from house to house and has built up a faithful clientele. Thus, every time a new bale of clothing is opened, she reserves the best skirts and outfits for her most faithful clients, which increases her bonds with her customers each time. Currently, she urgently needs to send out a new order; this is why she is seeking a loan through WAGES (one of Kiva's field partners) to buy 5 bales of second-hand clothing. <br

By buying and selling cattle, his goal is to have work through the summer months and to increase his earnings and increase the number of cattle he trades.

Salvacion has been engaged in her business for over 20 years.\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, Salvacion joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Salvacion has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Salvacion is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure and other farm inputs. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Salvacion from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business.\r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly in recent years.

He works as a elementary-school teacher and also drives a moto-taxi as a member of the \"Carrasco\" labor union. He has been an active member for more than 10 years and is on the union's directory. His taxi service is lucrative because of the high number of people who require the service due to its ease, speed and efficiency. The union has stops and shifts for each member in different points throughout the town of Ivirgarzama, where people use the taxi service. Sergio already is quite familiar with loans, but this is the first time he has taken one out with this institution. He plans to use the loan to purchase a new motorcycle because the one he currently has has run its course for his work. In this way he will be able to provide a better service to his customers, which will also help him increase his income and consequently improve his quality of life. It should be noted that Sergio came to Kiva partner CIDRE to request his loan after one of his co-workers commented to him about the institution's good credit conditions.<br \/><p><strong>Translated

His parents taught him to work on the farm since he was a very young boy.  He is now a farmer and has 20 hectares of land where he grows cacao and coffee which are both native plants of the rainforest area of the Apur\u00edmac River Valley.  He has worked in this business for 25 years and he says that he likes it a lot.  He also has the support of his familiy, in addition to the laborers that he hires so that he can finish his sowing, weeding and harvesting quickly.\r\n\r\nWhat Aquiles most enjoys about his work is harvesting the fruit from his plants since that is when he feels that the months of hard work are providing him with their reward in the quality of the fruit.  He considers the most difficult part of his work to be transporting his products from the farm to the warehouses, which are located in the city of San Francisco and Quimbiri, as it is very heavy and difficult to transport.  Another difficulty is that he doesn't have enough money to pay in advance for the laborers who support him in his harvesting and weeding.  This is why he takes loans offered by MFP.\r\n\r\nRight now, Aquiles' priority is sowing his coffee and cacao plants since he has enough space for this.  This is his 12th loan from MFP and he feels that the loan money will help him a lot in making progress in his work.  Aquiles is very well liked by the other members of his community bank.

Nohem\u00ed P., 24, runs a typing school, using old-fashioned typewriters. Hers is one of three typing schools in the town, but all the children need to learn how to type before they enter junior high school, so the school has thrived. Brenda and her husband started the school in 2004 after months of bureaucratic paperwork, and launched it with lots of advertising, and the business thrived from the start. \r\nBrenda charges about US$4.00\/month for students to study at the school, and they can finish with certificates of varying ability. Right now she has 150 students studying. \r\nLike many women in her town, Brenda also has other irons in the fire. On weekends she sells new clothes in the town's Sunday market. Her husband Saulo works as a health worker for a government health service. Both of them are still pursuing advanced education.

Within the property there are designated areas for different types of work.  There are four blocks used to cultivate basic grains like beans and corn and 16 blocks suited for the raising and herding of livestock.  He dedicates his time to growing basic grains like beans and corn, work for which Mr. P. is using this loan.  The loan requested is to buy six rolls of barbed wire to surround his property and pay for the labor.  Year after year, he enlists help during the summer to  maintain his property.\r\n\r\nSince he was 12 years old, Mr. P. has dedicated his life to agricultural work.  Working on his parents' small farm gave him a lot of experience in agriculture.  He inherited a property the size of 12 city blocks from his parents, which gave him his start.  He began planting and cultivating basic grains like beans and corn during the winter months.  Later, he bought more property so he now has 20 blocks worth, or rather, he bought 8 blocks worth of property for a total of 20 that he currently has.\r\n\r\nMr. P. worked with the help of his family: his wive and his five children who are already grown.  They helped him working in the field planting and cultivating until harvesting grains.  Currently his five sons are already married and living independently with their families.  With this investment he will realize in his farm, Mr. P. hopes to continue improving his property by securing the perimeter of his farm.  Doing so will prevent livestock from leaving his property and allow him to keep them safe and avoid their kidnapping, a crime that has increased during this current economic crisis. Because of these problems, many people--Mr. P. among them--feel the need to enclose his property to improve its security and to make internal divisions to manage his livestock better.  By doing this, Mr. P. hopes to guarantee his only form of work.  For example, when the agriculture is not well enclosed within its specific areas, the livestock are able to enter and cause damages that negatively affect the grains' harvest.  Mr. P. is taking advantage of it being summer to make these necessary improvements to his farm.  It will allow him to improve in his work, which in turn will allow him to ensure larger harvests and a more secure means of obtaining revenue.\r\n\r\nMr. Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas P. has had nine loans in the five years he has worked with Ceprodel.  The impact and benefit of these loans are very important, because Mr. P. is able to make improvements to his farm during the summertime. The help he has received year after has allowed him to improve his farm and at the same time his work, which has allowed him to continue improving his quality of life with higher income and better living conditions for him and his family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":485770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buying six rolls of barbed wire and paying for labor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-02-12T06:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1.46,"local_amount":29.23,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":30.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128926636},{"amount":0.96,"local_amount":19.19,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":20.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136654300},{"amount":4.47,"local_amount":89.46,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":93.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144687160},{"amount":293.11,"local_amount":5862.12,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6137.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195815445}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T02:38:00Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:31:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lydia Brantley","image":null}},{"id":179080,"name":"Feliciana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Feliciana N. is from the village of  Quezon Bukidnon.

D. lives in Almada.  Mr. Juan Vicente is a good person and very hard-working.  He and his family make handicrafts at home using artificial flowers, and then later goes into the interior of the country to sell.  He's been doing this for 10 years.\n\nThis profession was passed down from his parents, and Juan was later able to save a little capital to strike out on his own.  Thanks to the good relationship he has with his customers, he now has an established clientele and his business continues growing.\n\nHe is asking for the loan to buy artificial flowers to make his wares and also for resale, since many families in the area are in the same line of work.  Mr. D. thanks the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya for the support he has obtained for his business, through which he continues generating more income for his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

ALID\u00e9 offers special loans at 0% interest to very vulnerable persons and it is in a group that will soon begin to offer a micro-insurance program (health insurance) for the beneficiaries of micro-loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":301000,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"purchase of jerrycans of palm oil and of a locally produced alcoholic beverage called SODABI","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-04-09T21:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Colette ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":22287.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396357},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":11143.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904253},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-19T07:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":11143.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126287},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":11143.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549718},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":11143.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983509},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":11143.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96895878},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":11143.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735459},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":11143.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110622976},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":11144,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019683}],"funded_date":"2009-04-10T05:08:26Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":104748,"name":"Marya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marya is married.

Vasyl owns two small market stalls at different marketplaces in his home town of Belaya Tserkov. He has two hired employees who help him run his small venture. People bring empty glass bottles that are to be recycled to Vasyl. He collects them in plastic boxes and takes them to a recycling company. Vasyl has been in this business for eight years so far. Presently, he gets about 19,000 Grivnyas in income each month. \r\n\r\nVasyl is seeking a 5,500 Grivnya loan to re-construct and equip his garage with necessary units for glass bottle storage. Moreover, he would like to re-construct it so that he could keep his car there as well. Vasyl believes he could use his spacious garage facility much more efficiently if he reorganizes everything inside. People who know Vasyl always characterize him as a determined, focused individual who never stops when faced with challenges. He is a fighter and always makes sure his family has all they need.

She is a single mother and has three children (Gerson, Oscar and Xiomara). Her husband abandoned them several years ago. Since then she has been selling tortillas to support her children. She started selling tortillas 5 years ago and she sells them twice a day, from 6 to 7 in the morning. Out of her three children only the two boys are in school. The girl, Xiomara, who is 17 years old, doesn't, and has been working with Gilma selling tortillas since she was very young. This is because their financial situation was desperate and Gilma had no other option than to show her daughter her skills to help them improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested in the purchase of corn, wood and other products for the preparation of tortillas. With the money she will also buy her son Gerson a pair of glasses because he has sight problems. The loan will enable her to store raw materials for her tortillas and her son to see well and perform better at school; sometimes he feels sad because he can't see what's on the blackboard. She hopes that her business will grow and give better profits and that her son Gerson will find the motivation to continue to study.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alba Sort ,

Parnati and Yadi have been blessed with two children: Siswoyo and Abdi. Both have graduated from school and are currently living in Jakarta. \r\n\r\nParniati is running a food-stall business in Lili Market, about a 40-minute drive from Kupang City. She has been running this business for five years to support her husband, as his income from selling furniture is unstable as a result of expensive raw materials. Initially, Parniati aimed to run a second-hand clothes business, but this business will require her to move from one market to another market according to the market schedule. She then decided to run a food-stall business as she realized that not so many people run a similar business at the Lili Market, which is situated not far from her residence. \r\n\r\nTo run the business, Paniati borrowed money from a cooperative with daily repayment. The interest rate charged was quite high, but Parniati didn\u2019t have another option. Due to the limited capital that she has, Parniati couldn\u2019t improve her business. She then heard about TLM's lending program and got interested in joining the program for its monthly repayment and achievable interest rate. \r\n\r\nParniati is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 10,000,000 from TLM.

They have eight children, two of them are below the age of fithteen. She is now separated from her husband and lives in a two-room house with two persons per room in the Elemighong quarter in the Belo subdivision. Her first loan was given to her in 2010 and she invested it in the purchase of irish potatoes and beans to sell.\r\n\r\nJuliana is requesting her second loan from GHAPE to do farming and also to buy irish potatoes, corn, fowls, tobacco and kerosene to resell. She plans to use the loan for 120,000 FCFA to buy irish potatoes for 30,000 FCFA, maize for 50,000 FCFA, fowls for 20,000 FCFA, tobacco for 10,000FCFA, kerosene for 10,000 FCFA.  She thinks she will succeed because she is always available at her business site to serve her clients and she makes sure her goods are always available for her customers at moderate prices. The loan will help the community since she sells what the people want. \r\n\r\nJuliana has faced challenges in her life.  One of her children had died, she felt sick for a long time, and her children ran and stayed in the bush for a night. The profit she will get from this loan will be used to pay tuition fees, hospital bills and food for the family. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because repayment can be made bit by bit, the interest rates are low, and GHAPE also gives out a training series on loan management.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":789773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He has a cart on which he keeps fruit and he visits different areas and streets in order to sell it.  He will invest the loan in order to buy seasonal fruits in large quantities for reselling and generating more revenue. \r\n\r\nHe has been operating his business for the past seven years and Maqboolan

<p>Miguel is not only a successful farmer, he is the leader of the Primero de Agosto Asssociation that is comprised of Rice Farmers from Santa Lucia. He is one of the main organizers of their communal bank, having the responsibility of organizing the members and being the liaison with Mifex. He is also a very efficient rice farmer who has gained the respect of the community for his dedication to helping others. He will use the loan, like the other members of the communal bank, to purchase the necessary materials to plant and cultivate rice.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>The Primero de Agosto Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Miguel is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank.  All bank members are part of the Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia, and they will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":19381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Plant and cultivate rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T19:28:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-30T10:54:14Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":172,"local_amount":172,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21381},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:21:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40787},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:17:30Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45306},{"amount":812,"local_amount":812,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:15:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":812,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99060},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T22:00:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106820}],"funded_date":"2007-03-16T10:54:14Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T22:00:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10532,"name":"Bi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bi is 38 years old.

He wants to use the loan money to buy fertilizer and pesticide to be used at his paddy field.<p>\r\nI Putu is a hard worker and he believes the importance to work really hard for his paddy field in order to enable him to get maximal result so he can improve his family's well fare, to put on saving and also to repay his loan on time.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Antonius Gunadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nI Putu Sugama tinggal di desa Manistutu, sebuah desa di Bali Barat yang mana hampir 90 % penduduknya bermata pencaharian sebagai petani. Khusus untuk lingkungan I Putu Sugama, sebagian besar petani bercocok tanam dengan menanam padi. Hal ini disebabkan karena pengairan diwilayah tersebut mencukupi untuk menanam padi. I Putu Sugama memiliki lahan seluas 1 hektar yang ia kerjakan seorang diri.\r\nPada masa tanam saat ini, tanaman padi sangat membutuhkan pupuk dan anti hama untuk menjaga kwalitas yang didapat saat panen nanti. I Putu Sugama membutuhkan dana untuk membeli pupuk dan anti hama yang diperlukan karena semua dana yang dimilikinya sudah diinvestasikan untuk pengolahan sawahnya. Dengan pinjaman yang didapatnya, akan dipergunakan dengan sebaik \u2013 baiknya untuk pengolahan sawahnya. I Putu Sugama adalah pekerja keras, sawahnya dikerjakan dengan baik karena ia ingin mendapatkan hasil yang maksimal, sehingga dengan hasil yang maksimal ia bisa mencukupi kebutuhan keluarganya, menabung dan mengembalikan pinjaman tepat

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

He is married and has been blessed with 3 children. His children are: Thobias R., 18 years old; Merry Rasi, 15 years old \u2013 in Junior High School Grade 3; and Marthen R., 13 years old. Both Thobias and Marthen are not at school because they want to help their father (Zakarias) to earn money by farming. In this village, Zakarias works as a farmer who finances his family and the education of his children by selling banana, coconut and cassava. Sometimes the daily income that he earns is not enough to meet his family's needs. This is the reason why Zakarias wants to run another business. He is requesting a loan amounting to Rp 3,200,000 to buy cattle to be fattened.  Zakarias is interested in joining the cattle fattening program because he can benefit by the profit of the cattle sale. He has a dream to send his children to the university. \r\n\r\nThe other members of this group also face the same situation as Zakarias faces. Their income from farming is not enough to meet their family's needs. And like Zakarias, they also want to improve their standard of living by running another business.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have one child who is 17 years old. \r\n\r\nDesa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Desa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future, fund her child's education, do house repairs and buy home appliances. \r\n\r\nDesa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").

He is married and has three children with two of them currently in school. For the past five years, Stanley has been working hard to manage his poultry business. He sells chickens in the local market. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Stanley has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

At the moment the breeding pig is only tied to a tree because she doesn't have a hut. The 2 piglets are farmed inside a small simple bamboo hut.\r\nIn 6 month, she can get a net proceed of IDR 2 millions (approx. USD 210). This farming business provide significant support for her family. \r\nWith the future loan, she would like to build a larger permanent pig hut so all of the pigs can be farmed inside the hut.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Antonius Gunadi, Kiva Volunteer. <b><p>\r\n\r\nWalaupun dengan  kandang bambu yang sederhana, Ketut Suartini tetap berkeinginan membantu suami dalam memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya. Karena hasil suami yang didapat dari bertani, tidak mencukupi  biaya sehari hari. Dengan modal  pinjaman yang ada, Suartini membeli 1 induk babi dan 2 ekor bibit babi penggemukan. Setiap hari Suartini memberi makan babi peliharaannya sebanyak 3 kali. Tak lupa juga kandang disiram agar bersih dan segar, sehingga babi peliharaannya bisa sehat dan gemuk. Makanan yang diberikan berupa pakan dedak gandum yang dibeli di toko, kadang juga dedaunan untuk makanan tambahan. Induk babi hanya diikat dipohon karena belum memiliki modal untuk membuat kandang. 2 ekor bibit babi dikurung dikandang bambu. Dalam enam bulan Suartini bisa maraup keuntungan Rp.2.000.000,- bersih dari hasil induk dan bibit babi. Usaha ini sangat menunjang biaya hidup Surtini, bahkan untuk kedepannya Suartini ingin membeli bibit lebih dari 2 ekor. Agar usahanya bisa maju dan berkembang. Dengan pinjaman yang didapatnya nanti, Suartini juga berencana untuk membuat kandang yang permanen dan lebih besar lagi sehingga semua babinya tinggal didalam kandang dan bisa berkembang biak dengan baik."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":125731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Hasanboy has dedicated himself to raising livestock. He is married and a father who needs to support his children, who no longer need his help to complete their studies. His wife also helps him with the business. \r\n\r\nHasanboy needs to purchase calves. To commercialize the derivative products, he sells the raised animals to farmers who then resupply the small farmers with calves. To acquire the animals to start the cycle, Hasanboy has come to IMON International to obtain the necessary credit. In this way, he will continue to maintain his dear home.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His mother encouraged him to have his own business and she supported him with the capital he needed to set up his own telephone call center a year ago.  Since then he has been able to take advantage of his earnings, buying more modules for the phone center.  He started with just one, and now has expanded to five modules.  He wants to keep growing his business and to add some internet stations as a complement to the services he offers and to earn more, because he would like to be able to study for a professional career.  To be able to reach his goals he needs to work hard and get up early to take care of his business, which he opens at 8 am and closes at 10 pm.

Ese barrio es muy tradicional y famoso por ser el escenario de uno de los mejores desfiles folcl\u00f3ricos que se realizan en la semana del 11 de noviembre, cada a\u00f1o. La microempresaria se dedica a fabricar fritos como empanadas, arepas, deditos de queso y bu\u00f1uelos. El negocio comenz\u00f3 hace 15 a\u00f1os por recomendaci\u00f3n de su mam\u00e1 e impulsada por el hecho de querer generar otros ingresos familiares. Al principio utilizaba s\u00f3lo un caldero peque\u00f1o, pero con el incremento de las ventas debi\u00f3 comprar otros implementos de cocina m\u00e1s grandes. Actualmente emplea a dos mujeres que le colaboran en preparar todos los ingredientes que llevan los fritos. Todos los d\u00edas la se\u00f1ora Martha se levanta a las 3:30 de la ma\u00f1ana para iniciar su jornada laboral, porque debe entregar su producci\u00f3n a 7 tiendas del barrio y una cafeter\u00eda antes de las 8 A.M.

This neighborhood is very traditional and famous for being the scene of one of the best folk parades which takes place on November 11th every year.\r\n\r\nThis small businesswoman makes fried goods such as empanadas, 'arepas' (corn fritters), 'deditos de queso' ('little cheese fingers') and doughnuts.  She started her business 15 years ago.  It was her mom who suggested the business and Martha was motivated by the fact that she wanted to make some additional family income.  At first she used only a small pot for preparing her food but as her sales increased she had to buy other, bigger cooking implements.  She currently employs two women who help her to prepare all the ingredients for her fried goods.\r\n\r\nEvery day Martha gets up at 3.30am to start her work day because she must deliver her goods to seven stores in the neighborhood and a cafeteria before 8.00am.\r\n\r\nThis is Martha's fifth loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to invest it in buying an industrial stove, a refrigerator and supplies for preparing her food.  She sells on average 250 fried products at 500 Colombian pesos each.  Her profit margin is 40%.  Martha informs us that, thanks to her business, she is able to help her husband with their household expenses, provide her daughter with a good education and also some small conveniences that she never had when she was a little girl.  She believes that the success of her business lies in the quality of the ingredients that she uses and knowing the right temperature at which to have the cooking oil when she fries so that everything turns out delicious and crispy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":678981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy an industrial stove, a fridge and supplies for preparing her products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-12-27T16:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":153285},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":160248},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":163319},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166450},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":169640},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":172891},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":176205},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":179582},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":183024},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":186532},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":190108},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":198716}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.29},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.19},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.86},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.56},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.3},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.06},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.71},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80.29,"local_amount":153285,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":153759.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427759},{"amount":83.94,"local_amount":160248,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":160744.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001186},{"amount":85.55,"local_amount":163319,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":163824.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289207},{"amount":87.19,"local_amount":166450,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":166965.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157349},{"amount":88.86,"local_amount":169640,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:24Z","rounded_local_amount":170165.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230359},{"amount":90.56,"local_amount":172891,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":173426.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673445},{"amount":116.93,"local_amount":223239,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":223929.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803148},{"amount":109.9,"local_amount":209812,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-17T08:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":210461.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568227},{"amount":165.91,"local_amount":316742,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":317722.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779572},{"amount":190.87,"local_amount":364374,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:18Z","rounded_local_amount":365501.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188848}],"funded_date":"2010-12-28T01:06:04Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":265425,"name":"Nadera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nadera is the mother of two daughters and two sons.

By working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She earns an average monthly income of 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). Teresita is borrowing 10,000 PHP so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her fifteenth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP (which she paid off well within its term) was just another step on her journey toward economic freedom. Teresita hopes to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the <i>Dungganon<\/i> way.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

He lives with his wife and their two children (ages 16 and 4 months) in Ciudad Bicentenario, a large-scale housing and intervention project undertaken by Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  The mission of this project is to build self-sustaining communities.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn this community, Deivis offers car wash services.  He started this business because he needed a way to earn household income.  Deivis decided to offer his services to vehicles that travel along the main avenues of the city.  Being a young man with many aspirations started to give him more purpose.  As soon he completed courses in polishing and maintaining vehicle exteriors, he became certified as a technician to work in this type of business.  His skill is demonstrated through the great care he takes in making his business grow.  Going forward his goal is to have his own location where can he can attract more business, offer more effective services to his customers, and generate more income to help him provide for the welfare of his family and pay for a quality education for his children.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis Kiva loan is his first with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

Thi Dai's family was met with difficulties and hardship. Her children were young and unable to help out the family. She did not farm and did some miscellaneous sales at the market, enough only to feed the family. In 1998 she joined TYM and her first loan was 30.00 USD to raise and sell chicken and raise pigs with average monthly income of 42.00 USD. After 10 years borrowing from TYM, she invested in retail business and raising animals which provided her family with a stable income and greatly improved their livelihood, Presently her family has a house located right on Highway 3 so she opened a shop selling refreshment and repairing cars and motorcycles. She also raises geese and chickens, and no longer has to sell at the market. Her children are now grown and are employed with outside companies. Their family's average monthly income is 605.00 USD and with the loan term of paying weekly, she finds it very agreeable. She herself has always been exemplary in carrying out the stipulations of the fund, and is always eager to assist other women in the group. Thus during her time with the fund, the other women liked and trusted her and elected her into the management group. This time she wishes to borrow 1150.00 USD to invest in a car-cleaning business.\r\n<b><p>Translated from Vietnamese by Thu Ostrander, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nNhung n\u0103m 1990 tr\u1edf v\u1ec1 tr\u01b0\u1edbc kinh t\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u1ecb \u0110\u00e3i c\u00f2n g\u1eb7p nhi\u1ec1u kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n, v\u1ea5t v\u1ea3.

This year he is not doing as well as he planned, but he needs to marry off his daughter and needs to prepare a dowry for her.  He decided to take out a loan to repair his car and to drive it like a taxi with a fixed route.  He is planning to convert the car so that it runs on gas and the car will run on gas instead of on gasoline.  Gas is cheaper than gasoline, this is why he thinks this would be profitable.  His wife also works, she sells pastries on the street.  His daughter studies at the university, she is also learning to be a seamstress, so that she can help her parents in the future and to become a good tailor. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":291163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Convert automobile","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Yova","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T17:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:08:29Z","rounded_local_amount":190.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36016057},{"amount":50,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":190.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599781},{"amount":50,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-30T07:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":190.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994220},{"amount":50,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":190.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215501},{"amount":50,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:29:10Z","rounded_local_amount":190.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73644989},{"amount":50,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":190.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084516},{"amount":50,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":190.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000774},{"amount":50,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:22:57Z","rounded_local_amount":190.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846182}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T02:09:32Z","paid_date":"2009-12-25T09:22:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sabina Holzman","image":36162}},{"id":100700,"name":"Jerjes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jerges is a 48-year-old single man living in A.

The competition they face is considerable but the members have a great deal of experience and know how to prosper their businesses, offering a variety of high quality products. The loan they are requesting is to be used as working capital to invest in their small businesses, and to increase their earnings. This translates into a better quality of life for their family, improving more and more every day.  They are very grateful for the trust that has been placed in them and they are even more motivated to work hard. The members are currently in their first loan cycle but they have previous group experience.  They promise to give all that they have to prospoer responsibly and together as a team.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":370315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3300,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arturo Reyes","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dulce Yamile","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosendo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ross Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karen Romina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1798.37},{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1819.07},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1840},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1861.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1882.59},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1904.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1926.16},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1948.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1970.74},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1993.42},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2016.36},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2039.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.03},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":260.99},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":264},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.04},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":273.22},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":276.36},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":282.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":286.02},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.3},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":292.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1593.39,"local_amount":11105.45,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T20:58:59Z","rounded_local_amount":11105.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96946667},{"amount":276.36,"local_amount":1926.16,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1926.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96946668},{"amount":279.55,"local_amount":1948.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1948.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788335},{"amount":282.75,"local_amount":1970.74,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1970.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788336},{"amount":286.02,"local_amount":1993.42,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:07:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1993.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678455},{"amount":289.3,"local_amount":2016.36,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2016.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678456},{"amount":292.63,"local_amount":2039.54,"processed_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:26:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2039.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118072960}],"funded_date":"2009-09-30T15:55:34Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:26:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null}]}
