husband\u2019s dream of becoming self-sufficient entrepreneurs. Starting their careers as waiters, Marcela and her husband, Juan, began chasing their dream by selling sporting clothing and accessories at weekend flea markets. Recently, they made the largest business decision since they began pursuing their business goal: they moved to a permanent, fixed location.\r\n\r\nTen years ago, with strong encouragement from Juan, Marcela began selling military and hunting items at two McAllen flea markets. As the years passed, she began to envision a permanent location for her business, and she and Juan began to look at buildings with dimensions appropriate for their inventory. Six months ago, they found an affordable, central location and took a courageous leap of faith by signing a lease and moving their inventory.\r\n\r\nAt first, Marcela says, business seemed to flow smoothly enough; however, she soon started to see that her store needed more inventory. Customers demanded varied items that Marcela had never sold before, such as paintball gear and police suits. As she realized that her flea market inventory was not sufficient to fill the needs of the business\u2019 permanent location, she began to search for ways to meet the demands of her new customers.\r\n\r\nThis loan was the solution to Marcela\u2019s inventory problem. It was invested in new inventory, such as paintball products and police attire, to fill the unique demands of her new customers. After being denied a loan from a commercial bank, she came to Kiva partner, Accion Texas-Louisiana. Of this experience, she says \u201cThe loan helped our business a lot. Without it, with our lack of new inventory, I project that our business would have closed down in a short time.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Commander now supplies its customers with the sporting items they need. Some additions to her inventory include flashlights, caps, hats, bandanas, camouflage face paint, helmets, paintballs, facemasks, paintball guns, and boots. Marcela says that her business is successful in part because it offers more variety to her customers than her competitors. Without her loan, she says, none of this success would have been possible.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Marcela aims to continue her business\u2019 success and growth by providing her customers with their sporting needs. She will continue running her business with the support and hard work of her husband and three daughters. Most of all, with the help of her new loan, she hopes to continue realizing her long-time dream of being a self-sufficient entrepreneur.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":9050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":9050,"image":{"id":803787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sporting Good

She currently has a business selling juice and pastries.\r\n\r\nDoris is taking out this loan to increase her capital (buying fruit and pastries).  She will buy her products in El Tejar and sell them in her store.  This work allows her to make the income she needs to support her family.  She is married and has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen we asked her what she likes about Pro Mujer she replied that she likes the health services and all the business training."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":824486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fruit and pastries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2011-07-27T21:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tatiana Adelaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":8787.87,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":878.92},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":878.92},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":878.92},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":878.92},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":878.92},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":878.92},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":878.92},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":878.92},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":878.92},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":877.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.52},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.52},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.52},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.52},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.52},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.52},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.52},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.51},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.52},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":255.04,"local_amount":1757.84,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:17:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1775.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227115882},{"amount":255.04,"local_amount":1757.84,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1775.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232877537},{"amount":255.04,"local_amount":1757.84,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:20:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1775.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238694244},{"amount":382.55,"local_amount":2636.76,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2662.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244650278},{"amount":127.33,"local_amount":877.59,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":886.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250867274}],"funded_date":"2011-08-04T13:22:49Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T11:15:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":326005,"name":"Juanita De Los Angeles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juanita tiene 54 a\u00f1os, su actividad es la comercializaci\u00f3n de medicamentos.

He catches shrimp in the Quilca and Camana rivers.  He has been in this line of work for more than five years and it makes him a weekly profit of approximately 300 Peruvian soles.  Roger's main challenge is the closed season for shrimp as, during this time, he cannot fish for these crustaceans as they are in their breeding phase.\r\n\r\nRoger will invest his loan in improving his house (installing a roof).  Roger's dream is to finish building his house and to set up home.  He is grateful for the trust that has been placed in him."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":886089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She is a single mother of a 2 year-old child.   She works very hard to be able to provide the best for her child.  She lives in her parent's house with her two brothers.  Ely has a business selling a variety of products including: clothing, toys and accessories for the home.  She makes her sales in the street from place to place, and her main customers are her friends, neighbors and relatives.  She has been doing this work for 2 years.  What she likes about this work is that she gets daily earnings, but she dislikes having to walk around so much.  But if she doesn't sell, she doesn't have the means to provide comforts for her child.  Her business is going very well; she thinks that as long as she dedicates herself she can always make good earnings.  Her desire is to someday have a toy store, but at the moment she lacks the capital to do this.  This will be her 3rd loan with MFP, and she feels comfortable with her communal bank because everyone is very responsible, and they solve problems together as a group.  With the sum requested she will buy more merchandise so that she can continue to offer a variety of products to her customers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":911635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more clothing, toys and items for the home  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-07T00:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ely ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":292.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":317.74},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":320.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":343.85},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":356.68},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":368.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.82},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.15},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.22},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.94},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.82,"local_amount":292.84,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":297.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621948},{"amount":119.15,"local_amount":317.74,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":322.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836022},{"amount":120.22,"local_amount":320.58,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":325.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245781},{"amount":128.94,"local_amount":343.85,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":349.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385815},{"amount":133.75,"local_amount":356.68,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":362.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098908},{"amount":138.12,"local_amount":368.31,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":373.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713042}],"funded_date":"2011-11-16T16:16:10Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":358821,"name":"Asiraf","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asiraf wants a loan to buy cattle to resell.

agricultural work and raising cattle. These activities have provided an education for her children. She continues to strive towards providing the well-being and education for her children and also towards being able to cover the expenses that her delicate health demands.. As a result of this, her work has been very limited, and her profits have decreased notably.  Mutabar would like to increase the quality of her produce with the purchase of fertilizers with the goal of obtaining a larger income to continue the children's education and improve their living condition. She is requesting a loan of 5000 Somoni, which she will use to make her plans a reality.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 38 years old. Her husband is raises livestock. They have three children. Their son and daughter are 19 and 17 respectively and the smallest child is just 3 years old. Apart from taking care of her baby, Cholpon keeps a cow and sells its milk to purchasers. Cholpon\u2019s brother, working in Russia, once sent her money, with which she was able to buy five cows. Gradually she and her husband saved enough money to pay Cholpon\u2019s brother back. This is due to their 20-year experience in cattle breeding. Raising livestock, Cholpon and her husband have been able to buy some furniture for their house as well as some household equipment. Now, they need to obtain a loan. With this loan they would get an opportunity to purchase calves to send to mountain pastures, keep them and then resell after bringing them back. They want to increase the total population so that after selling some of the livestock they would be able to pay for their son\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nHere is Cholpon\u2019s team: Asilbek, Kadicha and Halima. Asilbek, 44, rents a piece of land, where he grows watermelons, onions, tomatoes and cucumbers. Farming helps him provide for his wife and five children. Now he is in need of a loan to purchase fertilizers to grow more crops.\r\n\r\nKadicha, 49, is married and has raised seven children! Most of her children have gone to Russia for work. As for Kadicha, she sells vegetables: onions, potatoes and carrots. Kadicha needs a loan as she wants to begin selling fruit and thus expand her offerings. She also requests this loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nHalima, 26, is married and has one child. Her husband does odd jobs at a construction site, whereas she keeps two cows and sells milk and yogurt. They want to increase the amount of milk for sale by buying one more cow. To do that, the only way is to get a loan. They have already built a new shed for that. \r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept -- People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

The intent of its ten members is to make progress through their businesses in order to give the members of their households a better quality of life.  They have small businesses like selling footwear, clothes, sweets, purses, and soft drinks.  \r\n\r\nPrimitiva Huam\u00e1n tells us her story.  She had to work when she was 15 because of the lack of economic resources in her home (Huancavelica), which is the poorest department in Per\u00fa.  In my house I maD. the most well known breads like mountain bread.  To do so, I bought the wheat whole and ground it at home.  I baked it in the oven my father maD..  I got up early to travel the streets offering the breads.  I had to be at the stop (the wholesale market in Lima) at 3:00 a.m. to buy vegetables like onion, corn, lemon, and spinach.  All are in packages, which I then distributed to the stores.  The next day I collected payments.  I maD. baskets from reeds.  I sold fruit (apple and prickly pear).  With these jobs I helped my husband support and educate our eight children.  I worked selling many things.  The situation was critical because my husband got sick, and I had to support him even more until he could reestablish himself.  I was selling food.  I stopped that due to the rent increase on the stand.  I bought merchandise like blankets, quilts and pants.  I sold them all and was able to increase the number of orders.  I needed loans to be able to fill the orders.  I used the loans I received to buy merchandise (pots, buckets, cups, bed, jackets, blankets, quilts, and shoes).  Through God\u2019s will I finished educating my children in school.  I improved my reed house with a corrugated metal roof into a house maD. from strong material.  All of this was possible because of the earnings I got from my sales and with help from my children who now work abroad.  My children do not want me to keep working because I am 65.  I receive some form of help from them, but I have decided to keep working as a small businesswoman because I feel like an active and useful person in this society.  My earnings pay my basic household expenses, and I do not depend on the money from my children because I know that they have their own families, which means extra expenses.  I will use the loan I receive to buy women\u2019s underwear, hosiery, and outfits that are in great demand during this Christmas season.\r\n\r\nMy name is Yenifer Gir\u00f3n, and I am 27 years old.  I started as a small businesswoman because I wanted to study for a professional career.  I knew that my family could not afford that because the economic condition of our household would not allow it.  That is why on the week ends I worked as a waitress in the rural clubs.  During this time I saved in order to buy summer sandals (30 pairs).  I got the merchandise at a lower price from my cousin because he manufactures them.  Thanks to God, I sold all of the merchandise to my friends and acquaintances.  I have been working this way for over a year.  The income from these sales, plus the work that I now do cooking in the clubs, allows me to study for a professional career in gastronomy in the Continental (Huancayo) Institute.  I can also pay my household expenses, and I bought a bedroom set.  I need this loan to buy 50 pairs of shoes, sandals, and boots.  Finishing my career is my goal.  I know that it will be hard, but in the end I will be able to finish it and be a professional cook.  I will be doing what I most like to do.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Lopepe has many years of experience in this business.  Lopepe needs a loan of WST $2250 to rent land to raise additional crops.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lopepe joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lopepe's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lopepe T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Light Market, which is the largest market in Liberia. She sells her products at reasonable prices which keeps customers coming back. She is 38 years old, married, and has four children who range in age from 7 to 19 years old. In addition to her children, Deddeh supports three of her relatives. \r\n\r\nDeddeh plans to use her 30,000 Liberian dollar (LRD) portion of this 100,000 LRD group loan to buy more food for her business. Her goal is to send all of her children to school.\r\n\r\nDeddeh is the leader of this group of five borrowers called \"Oneness\".

She is 40 years old, married and has four adult-aged children. To make a living, Emma owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling of different variety of vegetables  in the local community. Emma has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Emma joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emma is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional vegetables to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Emma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is 44 years old, married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Demetrio owns and operates a furniture-making business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from making and selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members. Demetrio has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Demetrio joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. Demetrio is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand the products offered. This will be the 3rd loan Demetrio has taken out from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay his children's tuition fees. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

From early childhood he had to help his parents in the field where his family cultivated vegetables. After graduating from Pedagogical University with diploma with honors, Abdibait returned home and began to work as a teacher of Russian language and literature at the local school. He was 26 years old, when he married and moved to Kyrgystan.\r\n\r\nUsing the money he had earned, Abdibait bought a house and rented land for cultivating crops. With the revenues from this activity, he bought a crushing machine and started his business of producing combined feed. He sells his products at the local market and supplies his loyal customers in neighbouring villages. In order to broaden his business and purchase crops for planting, he obtained his first loan from Bai Tushum, which was repaid without any delays.\r\n\r\nAbdibait plans to use this loan of 80,000 Kyrgyz Soms to purchase 10 tonnes of barley and 4 tonnes of corn. It will allow him to resell combined feed from these products in winter at higher prices. In the future, Abdibait is planning to give a higher education to his children and build a house for his family. Being a very purposeful and positive person, Abdibait works hard to support his family.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased employment and meet the interests of its clients and

The increased profits will be used to cover the loan and allow her family to continue bettering itself.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":845990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more corn flour for the preparation of chicha de jora (traditional corn-based beverage) and feed for her poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-09-02T07:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":66.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":73.2},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":74.55},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":80.15},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":81.3},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87.8},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":89.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":92.7},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":96.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":98.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.03},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.45},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.05},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.49},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.76},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.02},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.48,"local_amount":139.95,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":144.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232780138},{"amount":27.96,"local_amount":74.55,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-02T09:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":76.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238584676},{"amount":28.22,"local_amount":75.25,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-04T09:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":77.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244542852},{"amount":30.05,"local_amount":80.15,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":82.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250753353},{"amount":30.49,"local_amount":81.3,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-01T09:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":83.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257395374},{"amount":31.5,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":86.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263290890},{"amount":32.93,"local_amount":87.8,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":90.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270011780},{"amount":141.37,"local_amount":377,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":388.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276620929}],"funded_date":"2011-09-18T13:02:49Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:18:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":330122,"name":"Am\u00e9yovi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Am\u00e9yovi est une femme \u00e2g\u00e9(e) de 54 ans.

She joined a Maya business development training meeting about a year and half ago. After the meeting she asked herself, \"What can I do for myself?\" She spent about 6 months researching and then applied to Maya for individual credit. With the credit she received, she rented a little shop where she sells bulk wholesale and retail cleaning supplies as well as some household brand name supplies, hygienic products and gift items. Most of her clients are housewives. She has been operating her shop for one year. She says the first 6 months were very hard and she didn\u2019t make much money. She was new to the neighborhood and the neighborhood was slow to start doing business with her. They wanted to see what kind of person she is, if her business was solid or would she be gone in 6 months, and what kind of prices she had before they would do business with her. \r\n\r\nT\u00fclay did not ask her husband for support to start her business and, in turn, he wasn\u2019t very supportive. He kept saying and thinking that she wasn\u2019t going to succeed. She wanted to show him she could succeed and after 6 months her business started making money and she paid off her first loan early. T\u00fclay says that to show him she could succeed from her own efforts was very satisfying. She wants to grow her business but did some additional research before taking out her second loan with Maya and her first on Kiva.\r\n\r\nFrom the market research she has done, she will make agreements with two companies in order to buy bulk wholesale cleaning products from them. This is why she needs capital and how she will use her loan. She believes that by working with these two companies she can increase her profits. In the future, she wants to transition her business focus from retail sales to wholesale and expand the types of cleaning products she offers to customers. For example, instead of only selling household cleaning products to housewives, she would like to offer cleaning products for industrial workplaces, such as factories, restaurants, and car dealerships. T\u00fclay is ambitious but plans her business in small steps after careful research.\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff\r\n\r\nT\u00fclay 36 ya\u015f\u0131nda evli ve \u00e7ocu\u011fu yok.\r\n\r\nMaya\u2019n\u0131n e\u011fitim toplant\u0131s\u0131na kat\u0131ld\u0131.

Mwajuma is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala North region of Uganda. She is married and has one child. For the past 2 years, Mwajuma has been working hard to manage her small market, which sells food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mwajuma has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more food for resale, which will help Mwajuma generate greater profits and pay for her mother\u2019s medication. Mwajuma hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nMwajuma is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

Right now  his  house is  made out  of bamboo and thus not very well suited for  rainy  season.   <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Rosa de Oro (Golden Rose) Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Rosa de Oro helps the farmers by providing access to machinery, training services and government assistance. The farmers from Rosa de Oro are very close to each other and cooperate to help one another on their farms.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Rosa de Oro will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Rosa de Oro Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":33477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Cosechar arroz","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-01T19:28:55Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-17T01:36:27Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-06-14T22:56:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T10:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23074},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T16:45:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T10:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33119},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T23:30:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T10:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71898},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:26:12Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T10:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107741},{"amount":459,"local_amount":459,"processed_date":"2008-02-13T19:55:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T10:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":459,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":134852}],"funded_date":"2007-05-03T01:36:27Z","paid_date":"2008-02-13T19:55:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":13784,"name":"Suy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Suy E.

Aydalina's family is made up by her husband, who works as a self-employed truck driver, and their son. Her husband handles the responsibility of providing for the family; he also pays all of the basic services including the family's grocery bills.  Two years ago, with her husband's economic support, Aydalina was able to launch her own small business selling clothes, shoes and cosmetics in the street. The income that her business generates has allowed her to help her husband with the household expenses. They are a very close family. Together they have been able to progress, always with the objective of offering their young son better quality of life during his developing years, including a decent home. Aydalina's dreams of one day running her store out of fixed premises where she can offer her products in a more secure manner while also caring for her son. This mother's most urgent need at the moment is the need to close the back wall that faces the patio of her home, since it is the only wall still missing.

He is married and the father of 2 daughters.  The first is 6 years old, and the second is 2.  Only the oldest is in school.  Jose moved to Namaacha, a town on the boarder of Swaziland, searching for a job at his aunt's company who already lived in that district.  Jose came to Namaacha in 1997 and stayed at his aunt's house.\r\n\r\nHe has worked in a restaurant for 2 years and receives a monthly salary of 250MT, but because the income does not satisfy his necessities he started his own business with the earnings from his 2 years of work.  He started selling rolls and cellphone refills on the boarder.  He works from 7:00am to 8:00pm when the boarder closes.  His business has good results.  Jose already has his own home where he lives with his family.  Jose's best product are the refills that he buys for 15MT, 45MT, 74MT and 90MT and sells fo 20MT, 50MT, 80MT, and 100MT consecutively.\r\n\r\nHe has a monthly income of 3000MT and is able to save 500MT.  He helps his grandfather who is in Homoine by sending him a box of soap, 50kg of rice, and 25kg of sugar every 6 months that corresponds to 1,500MT.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan for Jose with Hluvuku and Kiva for the amount of 12,000MT.  He intends to increase the volume of his merchandise to satisfy the necessities and demands of his clients.  His objective is to improve his stand and begin work enlarging his house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva

Mamadjon has been in the taxi service business for the past 5 years. In addition, he dedicates himself to raising and selling cattle, work he learned from his humble parents. With experience gained over time in purchasing and selling cattle and a great deal of hard work, he has been able to bring stability to his family. The desire that Mamadjon harbors in his heart is to increase his capital so that he can acquire more animals. As such, he is seeking a loan in the amount of $700 to purchase more animals and to satisfy his customers' demands. In turn, he expects to generate an increase in sales and to therefore improve his family's future prospects.\r\n\r\nInformation about Tajikistan:\r\nTajikistan is well known for the following: (1) its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; (2) the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and (3) its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi, to name a few.  The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.  On the other end of the spectrum, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and thus only 7% of the land is arable; accordingly, this confluence of factors has resulted in high levels of unemployment and has forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries (primarily Russia).  Even though the people of Tajikistan are working hard to improve the country's agriculture and manufacturing sectors, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON International's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Marly started when she turned 18 years old on the Islands of San Andr\u00e9s, where she learned everything related to beauty in a course she took in the \"Sena\" National Learning Service. Later, she worked with a friend, where she perfected her technique. At present, she is using her Kiva loan, which is her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy beauty products. She will buy shampoo, rinses, dyes, massages, and nail polish in greater volume. Every day she has more customers and she needs to have materials for her business to better respond to them and also to be able to sell to them once they have received her services.

He takes care of his father Juan, his mother Doris, and his 5 siblings in his house located in the town of Bellavista Huaracayo.  As the eldest son, he financially supports his parents.  For this reason, as soon as he reached adulthood, he began to work for himself.  His parents needed his help with farming, their main source of income.  Since then, they gave him land where he began to plant peas.  What he likes most about his work is harvest time, because he sees the reward for the arduous work that he does.  Moreover, he tells us that he plants on a small scale because during the coffee harvest, he travels to work as a laborer in various coffee plantations.  \"I have to work in various places in order to be able to save money; I'm a thousand positions (a jack of all trades)\" he mentions.  His greatest desire is to become a great farmer and sow extensive hectars of land.  For this, he works without rest, patiently awaiting the moment in which he can invest with his own capital.  He belongs to the communal bank \"Se\u00f1or de Muruhuay\u201d and this is his second loan with MFP, where he feels grateful for the opportunity he's been given.

They have been doing this for more than three years and, thanks to his wife, who risked going to the capital to sell, they have more orders. She travels fortnightly.  What he likes about this business is that it gives him the opportunity to spend time working in a metal shop where he helps. Nevertheless, raising animals demands an improvement in the breed, which is expensive. Roberto works so that he can help pay for his daughter's education, as well as that of his granddaughter, and he pushes every day to increase his orders.<p>\r\nThe money that he is requesting will be invested in the purchase of pure-breed animals in order to improve the quality of his guinea pigs, of which he has 120. He not only wishes to increase the quantity of animals, but he also hopes to have a small metal shop in the future where he may work.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nRoberto, tiene 52 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposa y su hija de 28 a\u00f1os quien cursa estudios superiores en la universidad de Tarma y su peque\u00f1a nieta de 4 a\u00f1os. \r\nJunto a su esposa, se dedican a la crianza de animales menores, sobre todo de cuy, los cuales son muy rentables, porque los vende en la capital donde sus precios se elevan.

She joined the Fund in 1999.  Currently her family's main source of income is raising livestock and farming trees.  Besides that the family also has an income from fishing and crabbing, so their finances are becoming more stable day by day.  Thanks to a monthly income of 6,000,000 VND\/month, Mrs. V. and her family are much more able to improve their quality of life and pay for their children's schooling.  In this round of funding she would like to borrow 15,000,000 VND to invest in materials to renovate the livestock pen and buying more pigs to raise.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Saobaddin is 40 years old. He is married and has three children. He has successful business selling flour at the local market in Isfara. Saobaddin sells an assortment of good quality flour. Because he buys the flour wholesale, his price is cheaper than the price of his competitors. Thus, he has many customers, some of whom even buy flour straight from his house. Today he has a great demand for his goods and that is why he wants to take an individual loan. Saobaddin has requested a loan of $1100 USD to add to his working capital and allow him to purchase more inventory. He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices, and push every once and a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The hard work that Marlene does on her farm has made her plantings very productive and abundant.  She takes her products to sell in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma where she gets good prices for her products as she has very loyal customers who buy everything from her at wholesale prices.  What she likes best about her work is protecting her plantings from the pests that can damage them.  She has worked in this for 27 years and considers the most difficult part to be transporting her products to the market as transportation is very scarce.  Looking forward she would like to have a sales stand in the wholesale market where she could sell the products she grows.  This is her eighth loan with MFP.  She knows that she has to make all of her payments punctually and is ready to do so.  In her communal bank she is a very joyful and supportive member.

She is a very simple and hardworking woman. She lives in her own house together with her husband, Willy, 38 years old, and their 2 beloved children: Edith, 15, and Arnold, 6. She wants to provide them with a better quality of life. She passes her days knitting sweaters, scarves, gloves, etc. Her knits are purchased by clothing stores where they are sold very quickly. She sees a great demand and she works long to satisfy it. She knows that it is a very good income for her business. What she most enjoys about her work is to knit and she does it with a great deal of skill. She has 3 years in the business and she considers the finishes on the articles of clothing she knits to be the most difficult part.

Desde hace 40 a\u00f1os se dedica a la agricultura de alverja, papa (tub\u00e9rculo peruano), habas, cebada y flores como el gladiolo, paralelamente a esta actividad, se dedica tambi\u00e9n a la crianza de ovinos y reses que le ayudan arar la tierra para el cultivo adem\u00e1s de la ayuda incondicional de su esposa e hijas. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de la agricultura es cultivar gladiolos y alverjas, ya que le generan buenas ganancias econ\u00f3micas  en comparaci\u00f3n a los otros productos que existe en la sierra. Adem\u00e1s su producci\u00f3n es en menor tiempo y se comercializa r\u00e1pidamente en los mercados aleda\u00f1os a su zona. Con los ingresos que obtiene de estas dos actividades puede  brindar a sus hijos una adecuada educaci\u00f3n, y cubrir la manutenci\u00f3n de su vivienda e incluso puede ahorrar para comprar m\u00e1s terrenos para cultivo.  Es as\u00ed que espera en el futuro comprar grandes extensiones de terrenos, sembrar productos que m\u00e1s se cultivan en la zona y luego repartirlos a sus 7 hijos. Esta es la s\u00e9ptima vez que tiene un cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y esta muy entusiasmado porque ya tiene planeado en la inversi\u00f3n que har\u00e1. Adem\u00e1s continuar\u00e1 siendo el presidente de su grupo comunal en donde dar\u00e1 el ejemplo de cumplir puntualmente con sus cuotas. Con el pr\u00e9stamo tiene pensado comprar bolsas de semillas de alverja, semillas de la flor de Sarita, as\u00ed como insecticidas, sacos de fertilizantes y abono org\u00e1nico, productos que est\u00e1n valorizados alrededor de mil soles.","en":"Guillermo is 58 years old and is happily married to his wife Dora who is 55 years old; together they have 7 children, but only two live with them, Maritza who is 9 and Ruth who is 16 years old, they live in their own home located in a distant town in the sierra del Per\u00fa.  Since 40 years ago he grows green peas, potatoes, broad beans, barley and flowers like gladiolus, he also raises bovines and heads of cattle that help him plough the land for the crops, he also relies on the unconditional help of his wife and daughters.  What he enjoys most about agriculture is growing gladiolus and green peas since they give him good profits in comparison to the other products that grow on the sierra.  Additionally, their production takes less time and it is commercialized faster and sold in the border markets in his area.  With the income that he gets from both activities he can give his children an acceptable education, cover the maintenance of his home and buy more land for his crops.  He hopes that in the future, he can buy more land and plant more crops that are grown in the area and later distribute them among his 7 children.  This is Guillermo's seventh loan with MFP (Kiva\u2019s field partner), and he is very excited since he has already planned on how to use the money.  Moreover, he will continue to be the president of his communal group where he will be an example by paying punctually his loan quotas.  With the loan he will buy bags of green pea seeds, Sarita flower seeds, as well as insecticides, sacks of fertilizer and organic fertilizer; the products are sold for about a thousand soles.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Duque, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":459866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy green pea and flower seeds, fertilizer, organic fertilizer and insecticides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-30T03:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guillermo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1008,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886635}],"funded_date":"2009-12-30T06:16:28Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":169789,"name":"Thelma Leonor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Thelma Leonor A. es una se\u00f1ora trabajadora, emprendedora, responsable y honrrada.

Dushanbe. Rano is married and the mother of three children. She is determined to provide a better living for her entire family. Rano is hard working and kind, giving her the ideal blend of entrepreneurial determination and service. Skilled in trade and abounding in character, Rano has both a strong business base and a perfect credit history with IMON International. Currently, she is seeking a loan of $1500 USD to purchase a new vending facility and to expand her business. With the increased income, Rano plans to continue growing her business and to improve the financial situation of her family.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Merlanie L. lives in the village of Hda. Bubog, Brgy. Bubog, Talisay City, Negros Occidental. She is married to Pedro who works as a fisherman and sometimes helps his wife with her business. The couple is blessed with 4 children ages 13 to 34 years old. Some of their children help them with their business.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, Pedro's income was just enough when the children were still small. But as time goes by she noticed that their household expenses were gradually increasing specially for the food and education of their children. She then helped her husband fish and peddle it in her community. But she wanted to put up her own business as an additional income for their family. \r\n\r\nIn 2004, Merlanie's friend encouraged her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon as a group member so she can get a loan for the General Store. Upon joining, the business brought additional income to the family and helped with the education of their children. As her business continued, she was able to expand it because of her successive loans. As her loans continued, she was able to help her husband in putting another source of income catching crabs, and bale to buy fish net for fishing. From this business she was able to earn Php 8,000 per month. She saves most of her income for her children and for her family.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of Php 9,500 for her general store business was fully paid and she was able to access a bigger loan with the next cycle. At present, her 9th cycle loan in the amount of Php 12,000 will be used for the repair of her fishing boat, buy other fishing equipments and for her general store.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project \"Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\" - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":443761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The rest of the days she works with her husband.  She helps him by sanding wood for his carpentry work.  She also cooks for the family.  She is happy with what she does.  It is not tedious for her, and she has gained much ability with her hands.  She has been doing this activity for five years.  \r\n\r\nWhat she yearns for the most is to put a roof on her house.  That way she will be able to expand the carpentry shop in order to make large doors.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP, and she promises to make all of her payments.  She wants to continue to get new loans later on.  She will use the loan to buy carpentry tools.  She will also buy bags of cement to finish the roof on her house.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She lives with her two young children in her parents home. She has been working since she was seven years old selling peas, beans, carrots and other vegetables in season and ever since she has been in constant activity, buying and selling in bulk. Her mother helps with the business and also cares for her children. Sometimes she drops off and picks up the children at school which has allowed her to get ahead. Her greatest desire is to have a permanent stall within the marketplace, but so far she has done her sales as a traveling vendor. Her business is profitable, since he knows many people who come to her market stall. However, the most difficult and dangerous part of her work is the need to get up early to go to wholesalers, who will provide products to sell, but also expose her to potential assault and theft of her cargo. This is her tenth loan with MFP and she pledges to continue her payments. In her community group, she is a very dynamic and responsible participant. The loan will increase her working capital and enable her to stock her store and therefore to reach more customers.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Kellogg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":536337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more inventory to stock her market stall and attract more customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-08T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2559.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449389}],"funded_date":"2010-05-09T02:13:45Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Kellogg","image":null}},{"id":203150,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"refunded","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To invest in their respective businesses, including grocery stores, plant sales, flower arrangements, hair salon, clothing sales and others.

SPBD's loans are Falefou's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.
