small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Baptist Primary School was founded by the Baptist Church in 1974. <P>\r\n\r\nSince its inception in 1974, this school lacked a formal building of its own. The school depended on renting one unfinished house after another. But thanks to the government, through a World Bank-sponsored programme they had their first building constructed in 1993 with only five classrooms. This was not enough, however, to host the growing number of pupils in the community; the school was, and still remains, the only primary school around the Back of Police Community. Thus in 2000, the United Nations Observers' Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSL) built them another five-classroom building. <P>\r\n\r\nToday, they are proud of two buildings with a well trained and qualified staff of eighteen. They have a very good record in terms of public examinations. They always achieve a record of 100% at the National Primary Schools Exams (NPSE).<P>\r\n\r\nThis is their second loan from Kiva through SMT (Kiva\u2019s Field Partner). The previous loan was a great success for these teachers. Some used their loans to attend to their children's schooling; others invested theirs in businesses or agriculture; and others used them for personal expenses, like purchasing furniture. Still others used their loans to start or finish the construction of a house.<P>\r\n\r\nTheir head teacher, Mr. Henry S. K. (at the back left, in green), was one among those who invested their loans in building a house. That loan (Le 1,000,000), though small he said, helped him to start the construction of a house. With this new loan (Le 1,500,000), he will now be able to push the building process to another level. This is a great help to them, said Mr. Henry, who has been a teacher for the past 35 years. With a loan, each of the teachers will be able to handle a large sum of money in bulk, invest it in something great, and then repay gradually out of their meager salaries. <P>\r\n\r\nMr. Henry is now 55 years of age. He was born in a village called Bumbuna, about 30 miles from Magburaka, the Tonkolili District head-quarter town, Northern Sierra Leone. He is married with three children, who are all still in school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4450,"image":{"id":204766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":["Conflict

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She lives with Bernab\u00e9, her husband of 20 years. Together they have 9 children, only 7 of whom live with them in their own home in the Acocra annex. Their quality of life increased when her husband started working in a copper mine. Now, she doesn't have to worry about maintaining a bountiful and stable harvest--but she knows that this good period won't last long, so she continues to care for her potato and corn crops. She plants them for her family's consumption, and if she has an excess she sells them to the merchants who are always visiting the area. On top of this work, Alexandra also cares for her cows and sheep, which she fattens up so that she can later sell them at a better price. She is making money from working in livestock, so she wants to keep buying more livestock and increase her working capital. She belongs to the \"Jooc Sonjolla\" solidarity group, and this is her first loan with MFP. She hopes for your collaboration so that she can see her plan to fruition. She promises to repay her quotas on time, as she did with previous loans. She is grateful to be part of this association because all of the members are responsible and very united. Upon receiving your support, Alejandra will invest this loan in the purchase of natural fertilizers for her potato crops. She will also buy several heads of sheep."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":917946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep and bags of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-15T01:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":264.96,"local_amount":706.56,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:35Z","rounded_local_amount":716.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400739},{"amount":110.04,"local_amount":293.44,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869203}],"funded_date":"2011-11-15T07:56:37Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T11:40:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":361861,"name":"Sambath","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sambath, 41, is married and resides with her husband in Kampong Chnang Province, Cambodia, an area known for quality palm products.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

In this way, she constantly adds new clients and has seen her business grow. Farzona is requesting a loan of 2000 Somoni for 9 months to purchase new fabrics for sewing national dresses.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Elizabeth E.'s group. Elizabeth is married and has three school-aged children. She has run a general store for the past two years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elizabeth joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elizabeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elizabeth is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the seventh loan taken out by Elizabeth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Tan-awan, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  sari-sari (general) store and livestock fattening businesses. Her husband Jorge M., who is 53 years old, works as a welder to support his family. \r\n\r\nNila joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nila has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of their children. Nila  M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She began the business in March 2006, thanks to her grandmother who showed her how to make a large variety of dishes and as she didn\u2019t have any utensils to start her business she had to borrow some from her neighbors who supported her by lending her equipment. Her business has gone well for her.\r\n\r\nLittle by little she has been buying kitchen utensils such as pots, steamers, spoons, etc. and in this way she didn\u2019t have to borrow any and she could save time in making her food. \r\n\r\nShe needs a loan for $5300 MXN which will be repaid in 10 bimonthly payments. With this loan she is going to be able to buy raw ingredients to make her dishes and replace some kitchen utensils that, due to use, are in poor condition. All this will enable her to provide better service to her customers.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":274947,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy kitchen utensils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tampico, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22.216667 -97.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2009-02-24T01:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Evelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":530},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":530},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":530},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":530},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":530},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":530},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":530},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":530},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":530},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":530}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":530,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T07:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":548.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20350017},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":530,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T08:58:56Z","rounded_local_amount":548.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037289},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":530,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":548.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037290},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":530,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":548.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927701},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":530,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-16T08:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":548.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927702},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":530,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":548.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927703},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":530,"processed_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:54Z","rounded_local_amount":548.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382772},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":530,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:11Z","rounded_local_amount":548.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382773},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":530,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":548.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889457},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":530,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:31Z","rounded_local_amount":548.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889458}],"funded_date":"2009-02-24T09:17:25Z","paid_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":94672,"name":"Rosita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosita S. is a fish vendor.

She has five children and lives in Brgy. Canroma, Pontevedra, Negros Occidental. She is a dedicated wife who is determined to help her husband improve their life situation.\r\n\r\nMrs. S. has been engaged in food production for the past fifteen years. She and her husband, with the help of their older children, sell snack food, corn, vinegar and other food products to the neighboring towns, especially where there is a fiesta going on (and there is always a fiesta going on somewhere in the island of Negros).\r\n\r\nThis is not easy work because they need to wake up early to travel and set up their station, stay up late selling their product, and when the crowds are gone, pack up and go home. However, it earns a good income of about PHP 9,800 per month, so they persevere because it sustains the education of some of their children, and the needs of the family. Hard work, patience and discipline are the key elements to Mrs. S.'s continuing success.\r\n\r\nMrs. S. joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 and the unsecured loans she has borrowed over the last ten years have enabled her to make her business a sustainable endeavor which is a great help to their family.\r\n\r\nAt present, Mrs. S. needs to purchase a transport vehicle to facilitate the delivery of her products and transport them from town to town as they transfer selling locations. This is why, for her 17th loan, Mrs. S. is borrowing PHP 19,500 so that, with her own transportation, she will be able to reach farther and stay longer in the towns and not be dependent on the availability of public transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

She is separated, 42 years old, and has two children who are in school.\r\nWith her enterprising energy and faced with the necessity to improve her children's standard of living, Graciela decided to start her business with $18 in capital.  She began by selling a little, by buying and selling, until she knew more people and had more customers.  Finally, she decided to put more effort into this business.  Now she also raises birds at home, where she has a large garden.  She alone manages her business.  With this loan of $350, she will buy more domestic birds such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, and those animals in demand above all in restaurants where food of the region is sold.\r\nShe buys different-size birds in order to offer a variety of prices and increase sales; in this way, she also satisfies her customers.  She is very satisfied with her work, although the work is hard and she has to rise early.  She believes that her sacrifice is worthwhile in order to achieve the dreams and goals that she has in her life.

She is 42 years old and married with two children, aged 14 and 17. One of her children is in the 3rd grade, but the other child has a problem with his hand and because of that, he is unable to write. Beatrice and her family live around the Red Light community. She works in the Red Light market, the largest market in Liberia, which is located in Paynesville on the outskirts of the capital, Monrovia. Beatrice could not continue her education past the 7th grade due to the Liberian civil war.\r\n\r\nBeatrice's business is the sale of plantains, bananas, yams, limes, etc. She buys her goods from wholesalers and sells retail on a table at the Red Light Market. She has been running this business for 13 years and hopes to get into the general-store business in the near future.\r\n\r\nBeatrice started selling her general goods with 1,000 Liberian Dollars as working capital from her own savings. She got into it as a beginner. She talks to her customers in a good manner in order to encourage them to continue buying from her.  \r\n\r\nBeatrice needs this loan to purchase more plantains, bananas and yams for resale. She dreams of being able to give her sick son good medical care so that he can be able to go to school.\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Beatrice is the one holding the sign.

At 28 years of age, she has had to face major challenges, such as caring for and supporting her children, and helping herself economically without neglecting her children.  She has a business selling bed sheets, curtains, comforters and awnings.  She has been in this line of work for 2 years.  She travels through the neighborhood selling door-to-door.  She allows her customers to buy her merchandise on credit with easy terms.  She often travels to the city of Portoviejo where she acquires from the wholesalers the merchandise ordered by her customers.  In addition, she has a woman who works for her and helps her to sell in another area of the region.  \r\n\r\nWith this new loan she will invest in merchandise, especially for the beach season.  She will buy swim shorts and bathing suits for women, men and children, and other articles for the beach.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own house, because now she lives in a very small rented space, which her mother has given her to share with her small children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":495533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy swim shorts, bathing suits, and other items for the beach season   ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-02-27T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Jakeline Katiuska","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946481},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946482},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946483},{"amount":113.48,"local_amount":112.75,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":113.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674748},{"amount":196.52,"local_amount":195.25,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":196.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708912},{"amount":155,"local_amount":154,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892207},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632615}],"funded_date":"2010-02-28T00:16:00Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":185658,"name":"Earn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Earn Y., 43 years old and married, has lived for years with other family members in a medium-sized wooden house in the Siem Reap Province.

store. The profit from this business has been the main source of family income. Now she has access to working capital, her income is better than before. Alma is requesting another ASHI loan through Kiva for a much larger amount of 20,000 PHP to purchase foodstuffs for her store. This will allow her to grow the business further so that she will be able to support the education of her three children through college. With the support of ASHI and Kiva, she is hopeful that her income will steadily improve her financial stability and give her family a better life. Alma\u2019s biggest dream is to manage a full-fledged mini-grocery store. She believes this opportunity will give her the confidence to succeed while helping her family rise out of poverty. The financial opportunity of her sari-sari (variety) store is one of the best ways to help provide for her family.

They have three children who are from 6 to 14 years old. \r\n\r\nJonaly joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jonaly has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 17,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to add to her own capital to buy a new motorized fishing boat so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Jonaly C. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

She lives in a common-law marriage with Santiago Ruiz and they have a 5 year old son, Juan Diego, who is in pre-kindergarten.  Ver\u00f3nica and her family live in the community of Aserradero, that is part of the Acatlan de Perez Figueroa municipality in the state of Oaxaca.  Vero, as she has been called for many years, grows sugar cane that she sells to a sugar refinery.  She raises cattle (cows) and she has a truck that she rents out during the sugar harvest season (the time when the refineries begin their production) to transport the cane.  She decided to work now because she wanted to help her husband with the household expenses, giving her son a better quality of life, and to finish her studies.  Vero tells us that the times that her business does well are in the harvest season when they cut the cane, and she rents out  the truck.  She needs the loan to buy fertilizer, manure, plant food, tires and oil.  Vero wants to see her business grow so that it will give her profits.  She will use the earnings for her small son so that he can  study a career and to help strengthen his patrimony.   She tells us that she is grateful for the confidence that the foundation has shown her by offering the loan that will help her business proper.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":699153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Growing sugar cane, cattle, and a pickup truck","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acatlan de Perez, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-24T00:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ver\u00f3nica  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1763.57},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1895.15},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1938.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2040.84},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2128.47},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2233.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.96},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.93},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.53},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.07},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.38},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":146.96,"local_amount":1763.57,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1771.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850104},{"amount":157.93,"local_amount":1895.15,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1903.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292378},{"amount":161.59,"local_amount":1939.07,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1947.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160636},{"amount":170.01,"local_amount":2040.14,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2049.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233514},{"amount":177.38,"local_amount":2129.07,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2138.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512378},{"amount":186.13,"local_amount":2233,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2243.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223081}],"funded_date":"2011-01-24T04:52:08Z","paid_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":271704,"name":"Felomina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felomina O. is from the village of Lower Tiparak, Tambulig, Zamboanga Del Sur.

The representative of the group, Eudoxie (who has her hand raised on the photo) is 25 years old and married to a tiler by the name of Jules.The couple has two children, both at school and in their care. Eudoxi lives with her husband and children. She went to school very little. In order to provide for her needs and those of her family she has a business selling kitchen utensils. At the same time she sells palm oil and groundnut oil. Eudoxie gets her supplies in Benin and its neighboring state, Nigeria.

She lives in a rented room.  Her economic resources do not allow her to acquire land in the city.  She hopes that with the effort of each member of her family, they will be able to fulfill the dream of having their own house.\r\n\r\nWhen she was single she worked to help her mother with the household expenses.  Now that she is married, she works to support her own household.  For eight years she has been selling clothes in the entrance to the market in her district.  She is there every morning from eight until midday.  Then she returns home to perform her domestic chores.  Also, every month she travels to other provinces delivering orders of clothing.  She sells them on credit, and that way her earnings are better.  The prices are higher due to the distance she has to cover to deliver the order.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Tania is anxious to have a stable place to sell comfortably and be able to sustain her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  As a member of her community bank, she works carefully and enthusiastically to meet the objectives that she shares with her colleagues.  She will use the 1,000 PEN to increase her merchandise.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Elle s\u2019approvisionne dans le village de Kichanga, territoire de Masisi, fief du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Nkunda,ex leader du mouvement rebelle CNDP,\u00e0 l\u2019Est de la RDCongo.\nAvec  le cr\u00e9dit de l\u2019IMF Hekima, Mapendo Nazirambula souhaite accroitre son chiffre d\u2019affaire en achetant 15 sacs de braises.  Le grand defi de Mapendo Nazirambula, elle  n\u2019est pas encore \u00e0 mesure de d\u00e9barquer elle seule un camion pour ses marchandises, sur ce, elle est  oblig\u00e9e de s\u2019associer avec une autre personne (commer\u00e7ante) pour se partager les couts transactionnels et charge de  location de v\u00e9hicule transporteur.  \nDans l\u2019avenir, elle ambitionne accroitre son business et atteindre un capital de 1500$ enfin de r\u00e9aliser ses r\u00eaves notamment ouvrir un grand d\u00e9p\u00f4t de braises, ouvrir une quincaillerie. En outre, le souci de Mapendo Nazirambula est de voir son mari trouver du travail.  \nMapendo Nazirambula remercie  l\u2019IMF Hekima, pour les cr\u00e9dits r\u00e9guliers qu\u2019elle re\u00e7oit sans aucune garantie mat\u00e9rielle, car gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ces cr\u00e9dits, elle parvient \u00e0 subvenir aux multiples besoins de sa famille, surtout durant cette p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 son mari n\u2019a pas du travail.\nLe groupe B\u00e9n\u00e9diction  est compos\u00e9 de 13 membres, toutes femmes.\n\n","en":"Mapendo Nazirambula is president of the B\u00e9n\u00e9diction loan group, and it is her raising her hand in front of the door on the photo. A customer on her fourth loan, she is 33 years old and married. She is mother to seven children, of whom five go to school, the other two being still small children. Her husband is unemployed. Mapendo sells charcoal. She began this business with her own capital, given to her by her husband when he was working in a private individual's hardware store. Her initial capital was $50. She sells the charcoal at a public market in the Alanine area of the urban municipality of Goma, eight kilometers from the centre of town. Mapendo has been carrying out this charcoal business for five years. She gets her supplies in the village of Kichanga, in the Masisi territory, which is the domain of General Nkunda, the ex-leader of the rebel movement CNDP, in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The problem for Mapendo is that she does not yet have the means to fill a full lorry by herself,  so she is obliged to get together with another businesswoman in order to share the transactional costs and the expense of renting a vehicle to transport the goods. For the future her ambition is to grow her business, reach a capital of $1,500, and finally realise her dreams, notably of opening a large warehouse for charcoal and a hardware store. Furthermore, the main concern for Mapendo is for her husband to find work. \r\n\r\nMapendo is grateful to IMF Hekima for the regular loans she receives without having to provide any material guarantee. Thanks to these loans she is able to provide for the multiple needs of her family, above all during this period when her husband is out of work.\r\n\r\nThe B\u00e9n\u00e9diction group is made up of 13 members, all of whom are women. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4100,"image":{"id":533809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"15 bags of charcoal","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Indeed, the high-pitched voices of the more than 30 tiny students swell up through the house during the day and seem to be music to the ears of this happy, smiling couple. \r\n\r\nJorge sells natural medicines and takes pride in his work managing the health of his neighbors. He was born in Arenal, in the neighboring state of Bolivar, but has lived in Barranquilla since he was 14. He came here looking for a future and he found it, first going to the university until financial problems forced him to drop out of his Economics program and take a job at a local bank. He worked there for 5 years, and after losing his job began selling natural products. \r\n\r\nHis tubercular father had done this before him, and Jorge took advantage of that to take on his father's former clients to kickstart his business. This also permitted him to branch out of his neighborhood along with several of his friends, and they all  began selling their goods throughout various municipalities in Barranquilla and then in the neighboring states of Cesar and Guajira, then on in to Venezuela. \r\n\r\nThanks to this business (and the hard work his wife has done), Jorge has been able to take care of his home and family. This loan will be his first credit from Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he plans to use it to buy natural medicines such as antihistamines, vitamins, minerals, anti-aging products and even honey (to sweeten the taste of some of the more bitter medications), all to sell in his business. Jorge dreams of buying a place where he can independently showcase and sell his products. His greatest challenge so far has been the dearth of low-cost funding options available to small businesses, but through FMSD and Kiva he hopes to grow and continue helping those around him through his work.\r\n\r\n[EN ESPANOL]       \r\n\r\nJorge Miguel Jim\u00e9nez M. es un buen hombre que vive en carrizal con su hija de 18 a\u00f1os y su esposa, una pedagoga que tiene un reconocido centro educativo infantil en este barrio.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They chose the group name themselves but they weren\u2019t too sure about naming it thus because they wanted to call it \u201cVoladoras\u201d but opted for naming it \u201cMariposas\u201d since they liked it because it\u2019s an animal always headed forward.\r\n\r\nCristina, 48, has been married to Bruno for 32 years.  He works as a bricklayer and together they have a son who is 11 years old and in sixth graD. in elementary school.  His name is L. and he and his parents are very happy because he\u2019s about to finish his elementary education.\r\n\r\nCristina raises animals and this time has requested the loan to buy two lambs and two piglets.  She buys them when they are small and raises them to sell later.  She sold a short while ago so she only has three sheep left at home.  She comments that if she has any money left over she\u2019ll buy pasturage and corn.  \r\nShe\u2019s a little concerned about the price of corn because it\u2019s very expensive because the weather affected the corn crops.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in this business for 30 years and has had no problem in all this time because she\u2019s always striven to care for them well and when she sees them sad she immediately takes them to the veterinarian to be checked over and so that they won\u2019t worsen.\r\n\r\nCristina\u2019s goal is that her son L. finishes his schooling, not only elementary school but that he succeed in becoming a great professional because they run out of money on many occasions and when she runs out is when she sells one or more of them to get out of their economic tough spot.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are very grateful because they\u2019ve been working with FRAC for a long time and they are grateful because its help has been very useful for them especially to

She lives in a rented house with one of her daughters.  A year and a half ago she decided to begin selling various products, depending on the season.  Currently she sells blankets, going out every morning from house to house, offering her merchandise.  For Juana, this is very relaxing activity although she walks innumerable blocks to make sales.  With her earnings and savings, she was able to start a business selling food on the weekends a few months ago.  Due to the constant growth in her businesses, Juana has decided to continue working in this manner.  This is the first time she has requested a loan through MFP.  She is happy because this loan is an opportunity to make progress, and she feels committed to the communal bank she has joined.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started planting coffee and bananas, and slowly increased her fields, particularly her coffee plantings.  The quantity was such that Mayamin and her husband could not harvest them alone, as there was an abundant yield of coffee.  So they looked for workers and they harvested quickly, finally selling their product at a good price.\r\n\r\nAt that time they bought a car with the earnings, which is driven by her husband. Now they provide goods transport services; they are paid depending on the distance that is traveled.  But they have not left their activity of cultivating coffee, which at times is very profitable for them.  Mayamin is very pleased with her coffee farm.  From their first credit cycle to this, their second, she served as secretary of their communal bank, where she is held in high esteem.  For this reason she is very committed to making her payments on time.  The money that she is now requesting will be used to make a coffee nursery.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":425466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to make a coffee nursery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-12T22:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayamin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2009,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886528}],"funded_date":"2009-11-13T03:23:22Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":156342,"name":"Lorlina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorlina is a 46 year-old widow with five children, four of whom are already working and helping out with the household expenses, while the youngest still attends school. Lorlina has a live-in partner named Marcial who also helps her in her business. They live in Brgy. Libacao, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nLorlina and Marcial have a simple dream \u2013 for her youngest child to finish college, have electricity connected to their house, buy their own incubator for their balut business (balut is fertilized duck egg with a nearly developed embryo that is boiled and eaten in the shell), and be able to buy a tricycle (a motorcycle with side car) to deliver their products. If she accomplishes these goals, she knows that their living conditions will surely improve.\r\n\r\nEven before she started her business, she thought of what to do to help improve and make life easy for her family. She decided that selling street food like boiled peanut and balut. They developed a daily routine of buying raw balut and peanuts in the morning and cooking fresh batches daily and going around the town streets to sell their products. It was hard work but it earned a living for their family, so Lorlina persevered.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Lorlina saw the opportunity to expand her business and joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access the capital necessary to increase her sales volume. This turned out to be a good decision and she was finally able to set up a permanent place to display her products.  Now instead of operating a roving business, she can let her customers come to her in the same place every day. \r\n\r\nLorlina earns a net profit of about 10,000 Philippine pesos (about $213 US) or sometimes more per month. At present, she is setting aside a portion for her \u201cmotorcycle fund\u201d and for the education of her youngest child.  Her previous loan of 15,000 pesos was used as revolving capital for her balut and peanut business. \r\n\r\nNow she is borrowing, for her 11th loan cycle, the amount of 18,000 pesos.  This loan will be used both as revolving working capital for her balut and peanut business and to buy piglets to raise and sell for a profit when they are fully grown. Some part of the income from this will be added to her motorcycle fund until she could buy her dream motorcycle for her deliveries, and the rest will be for the education and support of their family. \r\n\r\nWhen she has bought her motorcycle, Lorlina intends to start saving up for her incubator so that she can make the balut herself and increase her profit margin.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":433633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

C. is 32 and married with 4 children (ages 2 - 11).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Loisi has many years of experience in this business.  Loisi needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Loisi joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Loisi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n\"The following social metrics for Loisi C. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Elsita is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Elsita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She also takes care of additional family members.  Kasifa sells yellow bananas in Nakawa market, one of the markets in Kampala City. She uses public transport to and from home. Kasifa buys from her place of work from delivery vans, which bring the bananas from the villages.  She wants to use this loan to buy more bunches and clusters of yellow bananas. Kasifa has been in this business for over 20 years and with MCDT for nine years. She pays daily market dues of 1,000\/=. She works seven days a week.  Her major business challenge is that of the rainy season because she works from an open place.

She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<p>\r\nIsabel is requesting a 14,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy groceries, various products and ready-to-wear clothes to expand her product inventory.

Through these business activities he makes the income he needs to support his family as his parents instilled in him the need to work and how to earn a living from a young age.\r\n\r\nThe chickens are dropped off at Jos\u00e9's home once a month so that he always has some available to sell.  He buys the concentrate and vitamins, among other things, in the city (a trip which takes an hour).  He goes there once or twice a week to make these purchases.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy concentrate, vitamins and minerals for the chickens that he fattens because he recently increased the number of birds on his farm to 700 as sales increase around Christmas time and the business is profitable.\r\n\r\nIn this way, Jos\u00e9 will raise his birds in time for the Christmas season, position himself in the market, and experience good demand.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is a very visionary man.  His goal is to save the income that he makes through his chicken sales so that he can set up a small agricultural supplies store because the place in which he lives is quite a long way from the city."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":918030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy concentrate, vitamins and minerals for the chickens that he fattens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:01:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Adrian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":487.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":512.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":488.02,"local_amount":488.02,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":488.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317500},{"amount":511.98,"local_amount":511.98,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":511.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283491777}],"funded_date":"2011-12-21T04:42:25Z","paid_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":361925,"name":"Rom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rom, 35,  and her husband sell vegetables.

Her husband had problems with alcohol abuse. This motivated Lyubov to find other ways to support her family so she decided to start her own business selling household items and souvenirs. Lyubov has been in business now for 14 years and has a couple container-stores located at the central city market. \r\n\r\nLyubov is very sociable and cheerful. Her positive attitude and smiling face attract many customers. Quick responses to any change in customer demand have helped her be successful in business. Lyubov has demonstrated responsibility and integrity in her relations with her suppliers and customers as well as when she has used lending services from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. Prompt loan repayments and stability in her business have demonstrated her trustworthiness and capability of further loan repayment.\r\n\r\nLyubov is requesting a loan of $1,200 to purchase inventory wholesale. She is planning to buy dishware, towels, vases and a variety of souvenirs in bulk which will sell really well. Eventually Lyubov would like to expand her business and start selling at other locations. Increased inventory turnover will generate the necessary funds to sustain her business as well as meet her family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432 \u2013

By opening this school, I will be able to provide training for the eager girls of my locality and will be able to increase my income.  <P><B>\r\nYasmin S., Pakistan"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":57041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Set up a sewing school","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2007-09-02T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yasmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-16T04:57:13Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2007-10-16T09:23:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68253},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2007-11-16T10:24:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82414},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2007-12-16T10:26:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:36:51Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98052},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116602},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136441},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159164},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:47:06Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183919},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211482},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:58:59Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239624},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-07-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T22:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":268551},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-08-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T22:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":297731},{"amount":19,"local_amount":19,"processed_date":"2008-09-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-17T07:07:56Z","rounded_local_amount":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":328313}],"funded_date":"2007-09-02T04:57:13Z","paid_date":"2008-09-17T07:07:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":20968,"name":"Ni Nyoman Sunantri","description":{"languages":["id"],"texts":{"id":"Ni Nyoman Sunantri, a widow lives by herself in a simple home.

Within this group, few of the members know how to speak Spanish.  This, however, is not an impediment to them in getting ahead with their businesses given that they know the local idiom of Maya Kachikel very well.  At the onset of the interview many of the women were intimidated by my presence and became very shy, since in their village they had never had a visit from a \u201cgringo\u201d.  Over time, however, and thanks to the support of the credit agent Marta Julia, they were able to gain confidence and share with me some of their experiences. <p>\r\n\r\nThe majority of the clients are in sales.  They will invest their loan into their small stores that stock basic need or convenience products.  One of them, Maria Teresa S., will invest her loan in the sale of wood.  Thanks to the loan, she will be able to purchase twice as much that which she bought before and she hopes that this will help her business to grow. <p>\r\n\r\nThe other part of the group works in textiles, weaving traditional fabrics.  Two of the four craftswomen contract other weavers for labor.  Marcela S. currently has three employees under contract to meet the demand from her customers.  Meanwhile, Lucia L., one of the older members, has six weavers under contract. <p>\r\n\r\nCurrently, Friendship Bridge offers all the members savings products.  The women commented that they are very grateful to the institution because they will finally be able to put their earnings in safekeeping.  They want to reinvest their entire savings into their businesses.  Another reason why they are happy with the institution is that it is one of the few that has offered financial products to their communities.  When the women were asked why they chose to work with Friendship Bridge, they said simply that it was because they hadn\u2019t heard of any other such institution in their community.   <p>\r\n\r\nThe dream of these women is to grow their businesses and, in this way, have a stable a enterprise that will help support them and their families. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres del grupo Patzuntzun II vienen de una aldea remota llamada Concepci\u00f3n en el departamento de Solol\u00e1. Dentro de este grupo de mujeres pocas saben hablar el espa\u00f1ol, sin embargo eso no es ning\u00fan impedimento para que puedan salir adelante con sus negocios, ya que el idioma local Maya Kachikel lo dominan muy bien. Al principio de la entrevista muchas de las se\u00f1oras se intimidaron con mi presencia y se pusieron un poco t\u00edmidas, debido a que en su aldea ellas nunca hab\u00edan visto a un \u201cgringo\u201d, pero con el transcurso del tiempo y gracias al apoyo de la agente de cr\u00e9dito Marta Julia ellas pudieron entrar en confianza y compartir un poco de sus experiencias. \r\n\r\n<P>La mayor\u00eda de las clientas son comerciantes. Ellas van a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en sus peque\u00f1as tiendas de consumo diario o de conveniencia. Una de ellas, Maria Tereza S. va a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en el comercio de le\u00f1a. Gracias a su cr\u00e9dito ella va a poder comprar dos veces el monto que ella compraba anteriormente y espera que de esa manera su negocio crezca. \r\n\r\n<P>La otra parte del grupo trabaja en el sector textil. Ellas son tejedoras de telas tradicionales. De las cuatro artesanas dos de ellas contratan a tejedoras como mano de obra. Marcela S. actualmente est\u00e1 contratando a tres empleadas para satisfacer la demanda de sus clientes. Mientras que Lucia L., una de las clientas m\u00e1s ancianitas, est\u00e1 contratando a seis tejedoras. \r\n\r\n<P>Actualmente Friendship Bridge les ofrece a todas las clientes un producto de ahorros. Las se\u00f1oras me comentaron que ellas estaban agradecidas con la instituci\u00f3n porque ellas finalmente van a tener un lugar donde guardar su dinero. Ellas, van a utilizar su dinero en su mismo negocio. Ellas quieren reinvertir enteramente su dinero en el negocio. Otra raz\u00f3n por que las clientas est\u00e1n contentas con la instituci\u00f3n es porque es la \u00fanica o una de las muy pocas que ha llegado a ofrecer productos financieros a sus comunidades. Cuando se les pregunt\u00f3 a las se\u00f1oras porque escogieron trabajar con Friendship Bridge simplemente dijeron porque no hab\u00edan escuchado de otra instituci\u00f3n en su comunidad.\r\n\r\n<P>El sue\u00f1o de estas se\u00f1oras es que sus negocios puedan crecer y de esta manera tener un negocio estable para poder mantener a ellas y a sus respectivas
