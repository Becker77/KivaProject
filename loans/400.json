She is planing to operate her own local business. \r\n\r\nJuana's story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in Los Arcarizos, a dusty industrial area north of the capital where free trade zones are common. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":578400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking

P. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Bungtod, Manlayag, Danao City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: pig fattening, food vending, and basket weaving businesses. Her husband Liberio P., who is 52 years old, helps in his wife's business activities. They have 7 children who are 10 to 28 years old. Two of their children have their own family, the other 3 are already working, and 2 of them are currently going to school.\r\n\r\nAdelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Adelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,600, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 3rd cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more feed and vitamins so that she can continue to save up for their future, improve their business and for her children to finish their education.  Adelita P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

His publication, the Gold Pages - Paginas Doradas, was first published in 2002.  Seniors now seek out his publication to find out about services that are available for them.  The Gold Pages Directory is available in three Texas communities: El Paso, Midland\/Odessa, and San Antonio.  \r\n\r\nFrancisco saw a huge void in the availability and accessibility of resources for seniors.  He approached the Area Agency on Aging of the Rio Grande Council of Governments to speak with them about his idea for a publication specifically for senior citizens.  He wanted to work with this agency to build his publication.  After securing this sponsorship, Ventura sought additional sponsors and advertisers from public, private, governmental, and nonprofit agencies interested in appealing to senior citizens.  \r\n\r\nWith the demographic shift to an older America, Francisco\u2019s hope is to continue to be the leader in providing the information and resources needed for older citizens to lead an active, productive, and engaged life.  Ventura is using the loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana to expand and enhance its presence on the web.

Meet Wilfred, 55 years old, who is a native of the village of Kanyakine in the Nkubu area of Kenya where he lives with his family. His upbringing was challenging and he never went to college so that he could secure a formal job, but he did not surrender to that. <br \/><br \/>He has been practicing farming for the past 30 years. Through farming, he has been able to take care of his family. His main source of income has been milk, eggs and crop farming, and through these ventures, he has supported his family because he is the only breadwinner. Wilfred passionately loves farming. Reuben stated that the most enjoyable bit about farming is \u201cit gives me personal fulfillment and feeds my family.\" <br \/><br \/>Although he has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious man. He has been facing challenges transporting his produce from the farm to the market. That is why he is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. <br \/><br \/>The Nkubu area is a rural town and roads are very poor. Wilfred has always thought that transporting goods has been a \u201cnightmare.\u201d He has been suffering losses because goods reach the market when they are not fresh, hence fetching a low price. Vegetables and milk are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market. Through the loan, he will be able to achieve his dream.

After starting several unsuccessful businesses, he's been specializing in the sale of audiovisual equipments and electronic devices (TV sets, DVDs, radios, tapes, solar panels, parabolic antennas, etc...) for four years.\r\n\r\nHe usually does his shopping in Ghana (Western Africa) and sells his goods for cash, wholesale or retail, in his shop in  the grand market of Sikasso. His clientele is mostly composed of travelers, truck drivers, and young music lovers from the city of Sikasso. In addition to audiovisual equipments, Mr. K. also sells school and office supplies.

This is 27-year-old Maria M. from Mbeya. She is married with one child, aged 4. Maria has run a business selling phone accessories since 2004. Despite being a \u2018developing\u2019 country, it is amazing how many people have mobile phones in Tanzania and in Africa in general--not just professionals, but grandmas in villages, school kids and vendors. It can be attributed to a number of factors, led by the fact that it is the only form of phone communication available to most people, because there are few landlines, followed closely by how relatively cheap mobile phones are here.\r\n\r\nMaria works at the business for 9-12 hours a day, 7 days a week and gets help from her husband. Maria currently earns about $300 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $375 to buy more phone accessories such as phone cases, batteries and chargers to resell. In the future, she plans to open another business. Maria thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more phone accessories such as ases, batteries and chargers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T18:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria P.

She lives with her family at Dome, a suburb of Mampong, in the Ashanti region. She has owned and operated a local restaurant and sold local foods like banku and abetie for the past ten years. Banku is prepared from milled maize grains and it is taken with hot pepper or soup. She needs the loan to enable her to inject more capital into her business so she can purchase more raw materials like bags of maize, baskets of cassava dough, meat, fish, vegetables and firewood. She says the cost of raw materials is very high now. She also wants to save part of her proceeds to provide a better education for her children.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She gets up very early to do her household chores like feeding the animals, cleaning the cages, and preparing her \u201cchica de jora\u201d (a drink typical of the region made from a corn base).  After doing these household activities, she has to tend to her small business of selling beer.  She says that she feeds the animals and later sells them to restaurants or her customers.  She has been in this business for 10 or 11 years.  It has gone very well for her thanks to the effort she puts into her business.\r\n\r\nShe needs a loan to buy more food for her small animals.  She wants to buy more beer because the end of the year is when she sells more beer.\r\n\r\nShe is thankful for the opportunity of the loan, and she promises to pay it on time.\r\n\r\nThe city of Urubamba is 78 kilometers from the city of Cusco, which is approximately an hour and a half trip.

On the other hand, she still feels happy that her son has taken the responsibility of helping them run their fishing business instead of rebelling against their poor life status. With that, her business eventually grew a bit, and she was able to support her second child\u2019s education in college.

 Q. is a 55-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  sari-sari (general) store and farming businesses. She lives in Cros. Bulanon, Brgy Rafaela Barrera, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her sari-sari (general) store and farming businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP10,000. Nenita  is now borrowing PHP 29,500 so that she can purchase more stock to sell.  This will be her 21st loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. \r\n\r\nNenita  aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Manzura is 48 years old. She is a widow with 4 children. Manzura sells dried fruits in the central local market. She has been in this business for 4 years. Dried fruits are very popular in Tajikistan - all hostesses have dried fruits in storage to serve in case her family has guests. Moreover, dried fruits are served as a rule during all family occasions, such as weddings and birthday parties. Considering the constant demand for these goods Manzur's business is quite successful and provides a stable income for her family. Today Manzura requests 7,500 Somoni to purchase dried fruits to increase the range of goods she is selling. Manzura has already demonstrated herself as a good client with positive credit history, but she would also like to thank everyone for their support and promises to pay the loan on time. \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with access to the varied financial services they need.

Laila is photographed at her center.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya. Most of its members are already working productively, but two of its members are women who have yet to begin activities. The activities they carry out include the sale of fruits and vegetables, sale of home-made foods such as meat, chicken and ham empanadas (savory pastries); the sale of various goods like noodles, sugar, flour, oil, and ham; and articles such as clothing, home remedies and others. They dream of a better future for their children, and for this reason work twice as hard to provide them with the things they need for their development and education. \r\n<p>\r\nOne example is that of Do\u00f1a Francisca, a seller of medicinal herbs who goes to the market early in the morning to buy her merchandise and hurries back to sell it among the shops and households in different neighborhoods in the city of Asunci\u00f3n. She is much loved by her clients, and the same ones always buy her products, says Do\u00f1a Francisca, who in turn thanks the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya for supporting her in her work which maintains her family of ten. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by David Kaisel, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":448513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of goods for sale such as: Christmas items, Herbal Remedies, and Food Ingredients.

Zuhro fights daily to help increase the family income so her children may have all that is necessary to have a good life. Her perseverance has given her family the assurance that she does everything possible to make their lives pleasant. Thanks to the hard work she invested in agriculture, she was able to purchase a small plot of land that she is farming together with her husband. However, the produce has decreased and the family expenses are using up the little capital they have. Zuhro, her husband and her daughter (pictured) have decided to purchase potato and onion seeds, as this crop is needed by the community year round. The situation that Zuhro finds herself in has made her ask for a loan of 3,500 Somoni. She hopes that she will find sensitive collaborators to help her get through these hard times. Your support will really help her.  \n \nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Despite his young age, he has been able, during those three years, to build a good business reputation.

Originally a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

Tajikistan for the past eight years. He has a beautiful wife and four adorable children.  Having already benefited a great deal from IMON International financial services, Abdurasul is now requesting a loan of $1400 USD to cover some maintenance costs and to repair the running gear of his vehicle. He is always trying to find ways to reduce costs and increase his profits.<p> \r\n\r\nOne of Abdurasul\u2019s main goals is to provide for his family of six. We believe Abdurasul\u2019s perfect credit history with IMON International and focused approach as a businessman will secure prompt loan repayment of the loan to all Kiva lenders. <p>\r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes its role as a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

There she has a miscellaneous business called Variedades Loma de Oro. She is married and has a 2-year-old child. She started her business two years ago with a small metal cabinet in which she displayed items very professionally-- she is an expert in merchandise and sales because she studied this subject and has also had experience in a warehouse. This was where she met her husband. They both left the company and started working independently, which they are still doing today.\r\n\r\nMaria started her miscellaneous business, and got a laptop computer and a printer because she also offers transcription, fax, and photocopying services. Her husband works full-time in the grocery store. Both businesses have been integral to the improvement of their income.\r\n\r\nMaria's dream is to see her shop grow into a large store, with stock to supply the demand and needs of her customers in every season of the year. With this goal in mind, she is applying for her first loan from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, through Kiva. She will use the loan to purchase a photocopier and stationery to supply the demand of the students from the local schools. This is a season of high demand, when fathers are buying school supplies for their children's educational needs. \r\n\r\nMaria and her husband are working hard to build a promising future for their young child, so that when he is grown and looks upon the vastness of the sea he will find happiness in a beautiful setting where his parents forged his

She relied on house rent income which she used to raise her children. Now her children are grown up and have started working. So Nusrat spends most of her time at home doing her household responsibilities. \r\n\r\nShe is the mother of two sons and two daughters. Her elder son has a motorbike rental business and her younger son operates a grocery store in the market. Her daughters stay at home and help their mother in her housework. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for the improvement of her younger son\u2019s grocery store business. With the loan, he will buy daily use items such as cooking oil, sugar, salt, etc. which will enable him to make more sales and earn larger profits. He has been doing this business for the past 10 years and Nusrat is hopeful that an investment will bring even  more profits to him and she will be able to save some profits for her daughter\u2019s marriage.   \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 2nd loan application. She has proved herself a responsible client by paying her installments on time in the previous loan year. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady with a book (called Asasah Passbook) is Nusrat.

for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Julia and her family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nJulia works as a subsistence farmer, but has also volunteered her time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables her community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Julia and four other promoters in her community, including Evalyne, William, Janes and John, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Julia will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Julia wants to be a promoter because she believes that the dispenser system will kill bacteria in water, preventing waterborne diseases and improving health within the community.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Julia\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1804151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To provide communities with free access to chlorine to treat their drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evalyne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"William ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janes ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":868290,"name":"Manik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manik is a 27-year-old woman.

is a self-sacrificing, loving father, 64 years old with eight children, six of whom are independent.  In spite of his age, he continues to fight to get his beloved family ahead and improve their economic situation.  Ever since he was very little, Santos has been around people raising animals, and thanks to this knowledge, he dedicates himself to selling herd animals, work that he learned from his humble parents.  With experience gained over time in the purchase and sales of all herd animals \u2013 cattle, sheep, and alpaca \u2013 he has been able to bring stability to his family.  The desire that Santos harbors in his heart is that of increasing his capital to invest in acquiring more animals.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Her stand is located in the Cerro Colorado market (an important market in the city of Juliaca).  It is very busy because of its good location.  She is a charismatic sales person.  She always convinces her customers to take something home.  What she likes best about her business is talking with her neighboring sales people.  That makes the long working hours more amenable.  She has been doing this for 28 years.  The most difficult part is having to stay in her stand all day.

He buys general provisions wholesale and sells to the residents of Sheriff Quarter. He has been running this business for one year and is hoping to improve to a bigger store with branches around town in the future. Abu had been facing some financial problems over the last months with his business but fought hard to maintain it because it is his only means of income. He talks to his customers in a good manner in order encourage them to continue buying from him.\r\n\r\nAbu needs this loan in order to purchase more provisional goods like vegetable oil, bath soap, cigarettes, margarine, etc., to improve business.

She has regular customers and she goes out at dawn and returns home in the afternoon.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":554311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" To buy potatoes, carrots, corn, broad beans, fruit, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-15T19:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892580},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632931},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:17Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846965},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113425},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407017}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T21:22:01Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":211830,"name":"Savorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Savorn S. is 36 years old and lives in Damnak village in Takeo province.

She is married to H. F. A., who makes shoe boxes on order. He has contracts with different shoe-making companies. They give him orders and he makes the boxes according to different shoes sizes to make an income. His business is going very well and he is making good profits from it. \r\n\r\nSakina makes and sells bread. She operates a tandoor (a wood-burning over made of mud that is used to make breads on commercial level in Pakistan) and works very hard in the burning heat all the day to earn a living for her family. Her business is also going well. She sells her bread for 5 PKRs and earns almost 100-150 PKRs on daily basis. \r\n\r\nSakina has applied for a loan from Asasah to financially assist her husband, who has large orders to fulfill these days. With the help of the loan, he will buy raw materials that are used to make of shoe boxes, such as hard paper and gum, in large quantities. \r\n<p>\r\nSakina is very confident that her husband will not let her down and that he will make good use of the loan to gain maximum benefits from his business.

With the money he plans to buy more supplies, snacks, and drinks before prices go up in December, which is usually what happens. With his previous loan, he bought more stock at better prices so his profits went up slightly. \r\n\r\nEdgardo\u2019s dream is to expand his store and gradually bring in stationery to sell. This will help him diversify into other areas and bring in new customers. His biggest challenge is having enough working capital. His customers pay their bills every six days, and he pays for his merchandise every 27 days. His profit margin is 23%, and he has a credit capacity of 65%.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":651941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more supplies, snacks, and drinks before prices go up","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Galapa-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-11-26T22:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgardo Jos\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":72635},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":77179},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":78465},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":79773},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81103},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82454},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83828},{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85226},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":86646},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88090},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":89558},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":95043}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.45},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.45},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.26},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.95,"local_amount":72635,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T23:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":75524.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427715},{"amount":42.45,"local_amount":77179,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":80248.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001137},{"amount":43.15,"local_amount":78465,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":81585.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289147},{"amount":43.88,"local_amount":79773,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:30Z","rounded_local_amount":82945.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157289},{"amount":44.61,"local_amount":81103,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":84328.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230301},{"amount":45.34,"local_amount":82454,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":85733.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509169},{"amount":46.11,"local_amount":83828,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":87162.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673393},{"amount":244.51,"local_amount":444563,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":462245.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325134}],"funded_date":"2010-12-21T05:29:07Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":256908,"name":"Roger Jaime","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Roger tiene como actividad la venta de comida atendiendo con el servicio de comida y bebida a una instituci\u00f3n de la ciudad, esta actividad la desarrolla juntamente con su mam\u00e1, esta actividad se constituye en su principal fuente de ingreso para el y su familia.

He was born into a large family with seven children and from childhood was compelled to be healed because of poor health. Unfortunately, his sense of hearing seriously suffered and now he needs to use a hearing device. From early childhood, Konichbek had a propensity to fine arts and gave his first performance in 4th grade. After graduating from college, he became an artist and worked as a layout man. \r\n\r\n<p>In 1980, Konichbek got married and soon became a father of one son and one daughter. His marriage was very happy, but in 1997 tragedy shattered his life - his beloved wife died and he became a single parent, taking care of his children by himself.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Abraham will educate his children and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Khalunyanu A group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, Abraham is pictured with his group members.

She dropped out of school after two years of high school to marry her husband Christian Chirinos.  They have a son, 11, and a daughter, 7.  She started out selling \"marcianos\" (a traditional sweet) but because she's always looking for ways to generate more revenue from the business, she jumped in to selling material for building small fishing boats and nets.  With her first 300-soles loan, that she repaid in 4 installments, she bought material for iced marcianos because that's what her customers wanted when she got the loan in the summer.  With this 1000-soles loan, to be repaid in 6 installments, she will invest in nails and wood for building small fishing boats.

This is 35-year-old Husna O. from Mbeya. She is married with four children, between the ages of 5 and 13. Husna has been running a salon since 2005. This is a place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or plaited, and made to look like your own. <P>\r\n\r\nHusna works at the business for 5-8 hours per day, 7 days per week, and is assisted by her husband. Husna currently earns about 150 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 700 USD in order to purchase salon facilities. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Husna  thanks you for your support!<P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":256111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase salon facilities ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T20:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Husna S.

The idea for the business came from Kifah, who has good experience in this area and wanted to help her husband to improve the family income. Many people prefer natural herbs over ordinary medicine since they have no side effects. Also, they are cheaper, especially since the GAZA strip is under siege and modern medicine is very expensive. So, Kifah thought of creating this micro business.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe business is primarily managed by Kifah since her husband is employed elsewhere, but he helps her after finishing his work. They asked FATEN for this loan in order to meet the high demand and buy new herbs and oil.

The family has access to electricity, but no piped water, and gets two meals a day. \r\n<p>\r\nTeopista doesn\u2019t incur additional transportation costs to and from shopping, because she buys from people who get what she needs from surrounding villages. She has a small bar where she sells all types of beer and local gin. She sells to all categories of people, at both retail and wholesale prices. Teopista works seven days a week, receiving an average of thirty customers a day. Her major business challenges include thieves and the rainy season which hinders her customers from coming to her because she works from a muddy place. Teopista\u2018s monthly expenses include school fees, rent for her business premises and residence, and feeding the family. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has been in this business for fifteen years and with MCDT for five years, now servicing her twelfth loan and working with the same group mates. Teopista joined MCDT because it was near her home and also to increase her capital. She wants to use this loan to buy more jerrycans of local gin and crates of beer.

Its inhabitants are of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds.  There are elements of the coast, the mountains, and the plains.  This makes for special and harmonious social interactions and productivity among its inhabitants.\n\nJos\u00e9 is 28 years old, and he emigrated to the Turbaco municipality, which is ten kilometers to the east of Cartagena.  He was looking for opportunities for a college education.  In order to follow his dreams he started studying law at the university.  But, the death of his father obliged him to suspend this career because he had to work to support his family.\n\nThat is how he started working at carpentry and bricklaying.  But, these activities did not generate enough income to survive.  Looking back to his heritage, he started making products from the pre-Colombian culture.  He makes things like backpacks, hats, and fabric bags.  \n\nWith his dedication, creativity, and by studying his culture a great deal he created his own work tools for handicrafts.  He made various types of frames and a slide projector.  He uses them to make his products, which are very well received among locals and tourists.  This is because he combines the current tendencies with the pre-Colombian legacy.\n\nJos\u00e9 needs to make headway with the quality of his products because this attracts the most attention.  Therefore, he will use his current loan for the amount of  2,100,000 COP to get a serger (overlock machine) that will improve the quality.  He will also buy materials and supplies like fabric and paint.\n\nJos\u00e9 is a very supportive person, and he often does work to help his family.  He makes small handicrafts and distributes them to stores and hotels in tourist city of Cartagena through a consignment system.  He gets constant weekly orders from businesses in the city of Amurallada.\n\nHis goal is to finish his professional career and to create an interactive handicrafts store where the tourists know and feel the productive process of the articles they are buying.\n\nHe dreams of later exporting his handicrafts and having his own place where he produces what he loves the most, handicrafts from the pre-Colombian culture.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Her husband Romeo, who is 51 years old, works as a tricycle driver. They have nine children between eight and 30. \r\n\r\nNemie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nemie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 to buy hollow blocks, cement, and piglets so that she can start something new and continue to save up for the education of her children. Nemie Ca\u00f1ete is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -- a title of esteem bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her training with CCT as a community partner has enabled her to be successful in business. \r\n<p>\r\nBeing in the direct-sales business, Maribel has developed the skill to choose quality products and deal with people in the neighborhood so as to turn them into regular customers. She sells shirts, pants, bags, shoes, cosmetics, fashion accessories and jewelry that suit the tastes of her friends and business connections. She earns an income by availing herself of discounts from product catalogs and then selling these items at their regular price to her customers. At the end of the month, she is able to earn a minimum net income of around 10,000 PHP.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 27,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to purchase items ordered in advance by her customers. She will also purchase items that are usually ordered by her patrons so that she will be ready to offer them to her clients. By doing this, Maribel believes that she will be able to increase her earning capacity as a micro-entrepreneur.\r\n<p>\r\nSure enough, Maribel does have her share of customers who do not pay on time. Nevertheless, she still prays that she will be able to collect their payments. She dreams of having her house renovated soon and that her business will continue to flourish so she can be of help to her family and relatives. \r\n<p> \r\nAll CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.

receives.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":702440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

He continuously plants 5 hectares of land, where he sows seeds for spinach, carrots and other vegetables. He has 10 years of experience in this field, and what he enjoys most is seeing how his crops grow day by day. He also mentions that in the heaviest harvest times, he contracts laborers so that they can help him finish the harvest, and then he travels to the city of Lima where he sells his produce. Farming is going very well for him, since he has lands near the river, so that he can plant in any season of the year.

She is married and has raised seven children, the youngest of whom is 17 years old. Uulkan's work in animal husbandry is a tradition, since her family has been farming for several generations. Now on her small farm, Uulkan has two cows, fifteen sheep and three horses.

O. is a 33-year-old mother of three children, ages 14, 10, and 7. All are in school and she is married to a police officer. Christine sells charcoal and sometimes makes dresses. She lives next to Nyamasaria slum near a Coptic church. She purchases the charcoal from trucks (lorries) that come around \u2013 bringing it from forests near Masi Mara. <P>\r\n\r\nChristine also owns six houses that she rents out. She hopes to use the loan to expand her business by purchasing more charcoal to sell. Her hopes for the future are for her business to enlarge and to sell out of a kiosk and maybe even a truck. <P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Christine saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Christine responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you\" and Erokamano, which in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/ <P>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.
