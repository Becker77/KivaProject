S. is a hardworking businesswoman who earns a good living. She buys her goods from the market at Korvon and has regular customers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, has epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients present a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is seeking a loan of 4,704,000 VND (275 USD) to buy a machine which she will use to produce tofu.  She will sell the tofu in the local market.  She will also buy five breeder pigs to raise.  Her husband works in the office for veterans and social affairs for the district Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc N.. They have one child who is currently in high school.  The family has a daily income of about 150,000 VND (9 USD).  In two previous lending cycles, she was able to repay her loan very well.  It helps her very much that she repays the loan in installments, rather than a single lump sum which would impose a heavy burden.  Thus she and her group hope to continue their participation in the next lending cycle.  The members of the group are: \r\nMrs. Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb T. is 43 years old.

They live in the house they built with the idea that they would eventually operate a business there.  Six years ago, Maria began operating a restaurant where she is the cook.  During afternoons, she works selecting and preparing fruit that she boxes up and gets ready to send to the capital where it will fetch a good price.  She spends between 300 and 400 soles for each delivery and she always earns a profit of at least 50% or around 200 or 300 soles per trip.  This time of year, Maria and her partner work carting fruit from farms to the city, collecting between 60 and 80 soles for each trip and getting the most they can for their labor.  They've been working this way for 4 years, enough time to learn where they can get the best prices, even earning a profit equal to 100% of their investment.  They leave the restaurant in the hands of their daughter so that they don't lose customers and return to their kitchen and their food as soon as the harvest is over.  Maria is a resposible client even though she doesn't have a lot of time to attend scheduled meetings.  She is current with her loan payments.  This loan will be used to buy citrus plants, oranges, tangelos and other fruits that will fetch a good price and a good return in the market.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":257061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy wholesale supplies of fruits for fruit business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T02:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2057.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989665}],"funded_date":"2009-01-17T04:13:41Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":88508,"name":"Chamreun's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chamreun N. is a leader of a group of five who all live in the Batheay village in Kampong Cham province.

Bajumpandan, Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a general store and by buying and selling charcoal and fruit.\r\n\r\nErlinda\u2019s husband, Jaime, is 56 years old and drives a motorcycle that earns him Php 4,500 per month.They have three children who are between 22 and 34 years old, two of whom already have families while the other child is currently going to school.\r\n\r\nErlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by operating a general store and by buying and selling charcoal and fruit. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 10,400 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nErlinda is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 19,000 was used to fund operations of her general store and her charcoal and fruit business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and on the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing Php 19,000 for her 12th loan which she again intends to use for her businesses.\r\n\r\nErlinda is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":485458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

To make a living, Ivy owns and operates a hog-raising business. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale.

Ivy has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Ivy is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be the fifth loan taken out by Ivy from PMPC.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With a lot of effort, Teodisa has been able to work her lands and make them very productive.

She lives in EB Magalona, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1996 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 20,000. Judith is borrowing PHP 25,000 to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 21st loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Judith aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

","en":"The borrower is a married man who is father to two children. He has a fish trading business which he started seven years ago with loans from rich businessmen who actively back small fishing businesses. He has never been able to make consistent profits as a result of the exorbitant interest rates applied by his creditors. Furthermore he was under huge pressure because he had to pay all the money he took in the morning by the end of the day. This business did not give him sufficient income to provide for his family's food, health, clothing, lodging and schooling. In order to break free from these loan sharks' claws, he decided to open an account with IMCEC (a Senegalese association of mutual loan and savings institutions). He had a first loan of 250,000FCFA over 12 months which he managed to repay in just three months, and the institution left him the interest for the remaining nine months. His market share has thus grown so much that he supplies two fish-processing factories in the capital not far from his town. His ambition is moreover to get involved in the export of fresh fish to Europe and the USA. Today he is requesting a second loan of 250,000FCFA in order to satisfy strong demand by buying three crates of black \"bad\u00e8ches\" (a sea fish) and three crates of \"thiof\" (another fish, common in Senegal). The profits he makes from this investment will be used not only to provide for his family's needs but will also contribute to him achieving his short-term objective which is to buy and construct his own house.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":6879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Sesame cultivation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Kolufifa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-12-10T19:08:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-25T05:55:24Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":775,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-03-23T04:49:28Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":11584},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-04-21T21:09:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13452},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:00:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16988},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:06:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17003},{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T20:35:28Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34417},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T03:56:45Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41438},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T16:58:12Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50172},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:21:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63309},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:25:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80005},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:30:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93751},{"amount":143,"local_amount":143,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T05:03:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106897}],"funded_date":"2006-12-11T05:55:24Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T05:03:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6580,"name":"Ernestina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ernestina is 27 years old and mother of one child.

But she was only 33 when she joined Tinh Thuong Fund in 2002. Young as she was back then, she was very willing to venture into business. She discussed joining the Fund with her husband so that she could ask for a loan to invest into making \"banh da\"- Vietnamese's traditional pancake. Mrs. Dao used an initial loan of 2 millions VND to purchase necessary equipment for her business. And since she was the only \"banh da\" maker in her area at that time, her products were sold like hot cakes. Mrs. Dao plans to invest the next loans into making \"banh da\", which has been a stable source of income for her family. Mrs. Dao has two children, both of whom are still in school but one of them is now old enough to help her with her business. Her husband is a motorbike- driver, with an income of 2 millions VND per month. Combined together, her family income is about 5 millions VND per month. In the next loan period, she would like to borrow 15 millions VND. \r\n\r\nTranslated from Vietnamese h by Khoa Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb \u0110\u00e0o Th\u1ecb N\u1ee5 39 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh Th\u01b0\u01a1ng n\u0103m 2002 l\u00fac \u0111\u00f3 ch\u1ecb c\u00f2n r\u1ea5t tr\u1ebb 33 tu\u1ed5i nh\u01b0ng ch\u1ecb r\u1ea5t m\u1ea1nh gi\u1ea1n l\u00e0m kinh t\u1ebf, ch\u1ecb \u0111\u00e3 b\u00e0n v\u1edbi ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 tham gia vay v\u1ed1n \u0111\u1ec3 \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 l\u00e0m b\u00e1nh \u0111a, v\u1edbi v\u00f2ng v\u1ed1n ban \u0111\u1ea7u gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb vay 2.000.000\u0111 \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 v\u00e0o mua \u0111\u1ed3 ngh\u1ec1, v\u1edbi ngh\u1ec1 n\u00e0y t\u1ea1i \u0111\u1ecba ph\u01b0\u01a1ng ch\u1ecb hi\u1ec7n ch\u01b0a c\u00f3 ai l\u00e0m v\u00ec v\u1eady s\u1ea3m ph\u1ea9m c\u1ee7a gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb b\u00e1n r\u1ea5t ch\u1ea1y, v\u1eabn d\u1ef1 \u00e1n nh\u01b0 v\u1eady c\u00e1c v\u00f2ng v\u1ed1n ti\u1ebfp theo gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb ti\u1ebfp t\u1ee5c \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 v\u00e0o l\u00e0m b\u00e1nh, kinh t\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh ng\u00e0y m\u1ed9t ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n, ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb l\u00e0m ngh\u1ec1 xe \u00f4m thu nh\u1eadp b\u00ecnh qu\u00e2n  2.000.000\u0111\/ th\u00e1ng, ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 2 con hi\u1ec7n \u0111ang \u0111i h\u1ecdc, 1 con \u0111\u00e3 l\u1edbn c\u00f3 th\u1ec3 gi\u00fap ch\u1ecb trong c\u00f4ng vi\u1ec7c l\u00e0m b\u00e1nh.

Each 50-kilogram sack costs 150 Peruvian soles.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":257100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase in shop merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T15:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1028.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080087}],"funded_date":"2009-01-17T17:10:30Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":88524,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Virginia D.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Every morning, Abduhoshim drives the herd to the mountains, grazes them, and drives them back in the evening.  Currently, Abduhoshim does not have enough cattle, but Abduhoshim wants to use this loan to buy two average bulls.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her goal has always been to build a larger and more appropriate place for her business.  She currently uses the living room of her house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":438854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T21:20:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayda Lina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150.06,"local_amount":3001.15,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3114.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110681493},{"amount":149.94,"local_amount":2998.85,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3111.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118076024},{"amount":150,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3113.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123912030},{"amount":150,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3113.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947884}],"funded_date":"2009-12-09T14:48:27Z","paid_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":162520,"name":"Adjovi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette femme a \u00e0 sa charge 02 enfants.

This will bring about a transformation in her business and enable her to achieve a self-sustaining life and cater for her family\u2019s requirements especially to fulfill her dream of educating her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":578748,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2047,"youtubeId":"EkSL7kKcuSc","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur Kihihi, Vianah from  Uganda","thumbnailImageId":578748},"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To restock her business with items like sugar, drinks, salt, and so on","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kihihi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-08-06T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vianah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilber","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yusufu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1066666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1066666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1066666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1066666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":487.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":1066664,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1074934.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903710},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":1066671,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1074941.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297177},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":1066665.01,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1074935.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467452},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":1066662.99,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1074933.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605542},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":1066672,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1074942.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744671},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":1066665,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1074935.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191482860}],"funded_date":"2010-08-16T12:11:48Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:07:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":224572,"name":"Filmen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Filmen L. is from the village of Nacional, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental.

V., 32, is married and supports her family by operating two business ventures: ready-to-wear clothes and motorcycle transport. She lives in Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her ready-to-wear clothes and transport businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,500. \r\n\r\nEmeliana is borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she can purchase a motorcycle. This will be her seventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nEmeliana aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

Living with her husband and daughter in a very cozy house was the dream that she had hoped to accomplish for a long time.  She studied when she was younger and was very dedicated.  She finished her studies as a pharmacy technician and worked in various pharmacies in her city.  She met a pharmaceutical chemist who taught her various essential concepts throughout her studies and with time, fate united them, and together they searched for a way to have something of their own.  They started a pharamacy in their home.  For thirteen years, they have run their business, and thanks to their abilities, it has become one of the most frequented pharmacies among those who are guaranteed efficient service from this sweet couple.

She is a micro-entrepreneur and the mother of two and she is married to Reymundo, a policeman. Their children are: Ace Angelo, 7 years old and now in grade two; and Joker, 4 years old. Nida has a lot of dreams for her two children. She hopes that, with her patience and perseverance in running her business, she will be able to help her husband provide for the education of her children as they achieve their own goals in life someday. \r\n\r\nNida is seeking the support of Kiva lenders in improving her general store business so as to be able to increase her daily income for her family, especially her children. She is requesting to borrow PHP 8,000 as additional working capital to buy more goods and other merchandise to sell in her store.\r\n\r\nNida also shared that she was already happy to see her children eat at least three times a day. But, as time goes by, she realizes that she could be even happier if they will also not only be given their basic needs, but also satisfy their wants to become diligent and consistent in their studies. She hopes that, through her business and with the help of our almighty God, her dreams for her children will be achieved.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":340774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The members of the group decided to give it this name because it is the name of one of the children of the lady who formed the group.  This lady is also the group's president. \r\n\r\nThis story is about Celina C. X. since she is the group's president.  She is 36 years old and a single mother.  She has four children: 10 year-old Luis \u00c1ngel, 8 year-old Eleazar, 5 year-old Sharito and 2 year-old Alberto.  Three of her children are in school.  Two are in elementary school and her daughter is in the second year of pre-school.  Her youngest is still too young for school.\r\n\r\nCelina owns a grocery store which she has had for more than 7 years.  She says that she decided to set up her business because she wanted a way of getting her children ahead in life and providing them with a better quality of life and a good education.  Her business also allows her to look out for her children and not neglect them.  She will use her loan money to invest in buying more groceries for her store such as: milk, oil, soft drinks, eggs, pasta, rice, sugar, salt, water, toilet paper and soap since these are the products that sell the most.  She uses the profits from her business to get her children ahead in life and improve their quality of life.  She can also now support them 100% with their studies so that they can have a better future.\r\n\r\nShe comments that her business is also benefiting the people in her community since she is the only person to have a grocery store and everybody shops there as it means that they don't have to go to another town to do their shopping which saves them time and money.  Celina's goal is to provide her children with an education so that they can study at university and get into good professions so that they can have a better future.  She also wants to grow her business a lot more.  She is thinking of expanding her premises a bit more so that she can have more stock and a greater variety of products to improve and increase her profits.\r\n\r\nCelina says that all her fellow group members are responsible people who fulfil their obligations and they all really like to work to improve themselves and overcome any difficulties.  Celina thanks FRAC and Kiva on behalf of herself and her family because thanks to them she has been able to change her life and her children's lives since they will now have a better education and quality of life.  The members of 'Sharito' and the business activities that they carry out are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbertina B. G. - chicken sales\r\nVelia B. A. - clothes sales\r\nCelina C.

is a 70-year old married woman who supports her family by operating a general store and a rice field business. She lives in Payao, Binalbagan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1993 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and rice field businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 5,400 PHP. \r\n\r\nRosalinda is borrowing 16,000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rosalinda aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Besides groceries they also sell candy and soft drinks.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to buy rice, beans, oil, napkins, bleach, soap, toilet paper, flour, salt, sugar, cookies, coffee, candy and soft drinks to restock the store and sell them.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that with this investment her business will prosper because she\u2019d like to enlarge it in the future and continue investing in it because she\u2019s always liked to have it well stocked so that her customers can find what they are looking for and confidently keep coming back to buy from her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":777528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tierra Blanca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-05-27T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.55,"local_amount":1250.6,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1318.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233889},{"amount":112.45,"local_amount":1249.4,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1317.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512731},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1317.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223377},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1317.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201654}],"funded_date":"2011-05-28T15:16:04Z","paid_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":306550,"name":"Renato","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Renato, 49 years old, is married and blessed with seven children.

The business she works in is selling clothes and she has a stall in the \"Gamarrita\" market in the city of San Francisco in the department of Ayacucho-Peru. Every day she serves many customers who know that the clothes she brings from Lima are good quality and in fashion so they don't hesitate to buy in large quantities. What she most likes about her work is distracting herself with each of her customers and taking the opportunity to advise them about the clothes that will best suit them. In this way, she gains the confidence of each customer. She has been doing this work for 45 years and thinks that the most difficult thing is that she has to work long hours waiting on customers. Leoncia is grateful for the support of the financiers as, thanks to their support, she is progressing and is able to afford some comforts. In the future, she hopes to have the same strength she has had in previous years as her business is her only financial support.

She tells us that she has been selling handicrafts for 10 years and selling gas for just 3 months as she started the busness with her previous loan.\r\n\r\nThis loan is for the purchase of more handicrafts and gas cylinders. She has been with the communal bank for 6 years and she enjoys the support they give her to get ahead.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a big business.\r\n\r\n.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":858052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy handicrafts and gas cylinders.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-09-16T08:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1045,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":130.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.51,"local_amount":261.26,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":262.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232798007},{"amount":262.51,"local_amount":261.26,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":262.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238609099},{"amount":262.51,"local_amount":261.26,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":262.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244563367},{"amount":262.47,"local_amount":261.22,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":262.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250774344}],"funded_date":"2011-09-16T13:42:55Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:04:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":339350,"name":"Rolando","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rolando is 58 years old and lives in the Philippines.

This is 28-year-old Joyce M. from Mwanza. She is married with 3 children between the ages of 4 and 15 years old. Joyce owns a small duka or neighborhood shop in the city where she sells common household and grocery items. She has had her shop since 2006. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Joyce currently earns about $160 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD to purchase kanga, cosmetics and soda. In the future, she plans to add more business. Joyce thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Her insurance claim was reduced and as vulnerable as she was, she could not get a good lawyer to defend her to collect what is due her. Looking at her situation, Jennifer wanted to commit suicide but she did not upon the advice of her religious leaders and other people. Before that, she used to sew dresses and undertake other businesses that demanded the use of both hands. Right now Jennifer cannot sew dresses apart from patching her daughter's dress. Currently she is into the sale of cooking utensils and selling of lace and clothing materials. She sells through hawking, house-to-house selling; she had 10 years experience in sewing until the pathetic incident occurred. Jennifer also travels to the nearby communities to sell during their market days. She is adapting to her new predicament. Jennifer needs money to provide for her child, herself and the family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The father of 5 children between the ages of 15 and 25 (the two youngest still in school), Fenias currently lives in Namaacha. In addition to supporting his family he also contributes 1.000,00 mt per month toward the care of his mentally disabled sister, who lives in Maputo.\r\n\r\nFenias left Gaza as a young men to go to Tete (in northern Mozambique) on a special mission as a military Commander, and soon after was sent to jail for 3 months for disagreeing with his superior's ideas and decisions. After being released from jail, he joined Renamo (a political party who fought against the Frelimo party in the 16-year civil war in Mozambique) and was sent to Swaziland, as a representative of the party, where he worked for 25 years. His years of work in Swaziland allowed him to build 18 rental places there, for which he charges 100 randes (the equivalent of 350.00 mt per unit). He counts with the help of his daughter to manage the places and collect rent.\r\n\r\nAs a reformed military he moved back to Mozambique and settled in Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, where he has since been running a grocery store (located 45 km from Namacha and near an elementary school) serving people who prior to that had to travel much further to find a commercial establishment. Fenias bestselling products are fish, sugar, rice and crackers. He has one employee and earns 4.000.00 mt per month, which allows him to support his family, pay his helper's salary and still save about 2.000,00 mt.\r\n\r\nThis is Fenias' first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva (he has never applied for a loan before). He will use it to increase his stock, and expects to repay it without a problem. He plans to apply for more loans in the future, to keep investing in meeting the demand for his products as well as increasing the level of satisfaction of his clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

Albert would have a difficult time getting his company off the ground without this loan.\r\n\r\nA constant challenge for Albert is that property management companies only want to contract construction companies with whom they have had past experience. Although Albert has completed a variety of construction projects, these have not been under the name of his construction company.

He plans on utilizing the loan proceeds to buy chicken in larger quantities so that he can both satisfy customer demand and generate an increase in his income.

What she does is buy the chicks or chickens two days from hatching and raises them with the necessary care this type of animal requires.  When they reach the age of 6 weeks and they weigh about five pounds or more they are ready for sale.  \r\n\r\nLocal customer demand for her beautiful chickens has increased lately and sometimes she can\u2019t meet all the demand.  Because of this she\u2019s decided to ask INTEGERAL for a loan to invest in her business and buy a larger number of chicks and chickens as well as supplies needed to maintain them such as: concentrated feed and vaccines to prevent illness.  She has faith in God that these measures will improve her situation and she\u2019ll be able to provide her children with a better life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":750175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" to buy chicks and chickens to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Talnique, La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-04-14T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31.1},{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":34.04},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":34.39},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":36.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":36.95},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":38.3},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40.36},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":41.15},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":43.23},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":44.24},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":45.86},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":48.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":49.27},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":51.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":52.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":60.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.1},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.04},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.39},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.44},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.95},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.3},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.36},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.15},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.23},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.24},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.86},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.1,"local_amount":31.1,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-20T07:44:53Z","rounded_local_amount":31.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206733318},{"amount":34.19,"local_amount":34.19,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":34.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211388628},{"amount":34.24,"local_amount":34.24,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":34.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216448802},{"amount":36.57,"local_amount":36.57,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:13:50Z","rounded_local_amount":36.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221612860},{"amount":663.9,"local_amount":663.9,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":663.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226982139}],"funded_date":"2011-04-22T19:05:01Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:22:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":294271,"name":"Letecia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Letecia F. is from the village of Kiraging, South Cogon, Misamis Oriental.

Her family includes her husband Emerson and their five children, all of whom are minors.  In the harmony of a close family, they live in their own house, located in the community of Uni\u00f3n Palomar (central Peruvian rain forest).  She knows that the road to progress is long, and more so with children to nurture and educate.  However, this doesn't discourage her, because she is a diligent, hard-working woman.  Agriculture is her main source of income.  Her crops consist of coffee, plantains, and avocado.  She has worked at this for the past 13 years and what she enjoys the most is beginning the \"rebusca\" (searching for the first ripe coffee beans) at the start of the harvest.  Her dedication and the love that she bestows upon her crops is what make her products the good quality that they are.  Besides working constantly in her coffee fields, she also bags the seeds that germinate in a nursery, where she spends the greater part of the weekend taking care of them.  Because the experts know of her good work, coffee merchants from the city of Villa Rica seek her business constantly.  In the future, she wishes to continue improving her crops.  She belongs to the communal bank \u201cPrestatarios de uni\u00f3n palomar\u201d and this is her second loan with MFP, where she is sure she will be able to move forward with the help of all of you.  Moreover, she is grateful for all of your monetary support, promising to be punctual with her payments.

Meet Aska, a youthful 42-year-old mum, a wise farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Mumbu. Kenyenya, in the Nyanza region of Kenya. Aska is happily married and together with her husband, blessed with eight lovely children. \n\nFor the past 10 years, Aska has been involved in mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been growing maize, tomatoes and also, she keeps dairy cows. Aska has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Aska joined Juhudi Kilimo which is a micro finance institution that assists smallholder women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Aska is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge and she has suffered many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetable and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price and through this loan Aska is going to achieve her dream and goals. \n\nAccessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is a big problem but Aska feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women. The benefits of this loan cannot be underestimated because Aska will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market and also, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market and hence increase her income level. With your loan, Aska will improve her living conditions and assure her 8 children of a secure future.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2031681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike to transport produce to market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kenyenya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aska","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2016-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2016-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.74},{"due_date":"2016-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.35},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.73},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.62},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.68},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.92},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.62},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":987597,"name":"Nelly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nelly is a beautiful woman of 41 years, a person who enjoys independent work, who has big dreams and aspirations for her life.Speaking with her, it becomes obvious that she is a very hardworking and helpful woman, and that everything she does is for her family's benefit and well-being. \n\nShe lives in a humble home in the town of Kapsowar, along with a handsome husband and their five angelic looking children.

Despite this situation, he became more motivated to work for a better life by raising cow. Fortunately, the cow's food materials in his neighborhood are quite abundant. Due to limited capital, he can only raise 1 cow. The cow was bought with price Rp. 3,500,000 (about $387) and in 4 months he could sell it for Rp. 5,000,000 (about $553) so his net profit was Rp. 800,000 (about $88) after subtracting the cow's food expenses. Although the profit was not much, he is very thankful because he can cover his family's daily expenses. His dream to repair his house has encouraged him to save some money from this business. After getting the loan from DINARI, he will work harder in this business because the loans will make his hope to expand the business become reality. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nTinggal di rumah yang sangat sederhana yang hanya berdinding gedeg  tidak membuat Made Parma dan keluarganya patah semangat dalam menjalani kehidupan. Segala kesederhanaan itu justru membuatnya bersemangat dalam bekerja untuk bisa hidup lebih baik lagi yaitu dengan  memelihara sapi. Hal ini dilakukannya mengingat situasi lingkungan yang mendukung yaitu dengan tersedianya pakan yang cukup bagi keperluan ternaknya ini.  Terbatasnya modal yang dimiliki mengharuskan Made Parma hanya memelihara 1 ekor sapi . Sapi itu dibeli dengan harga Rp. 3.500.000,- dan  dalam waktu 4 bulan berhasil dijualnya dengan harga Rp. 5.000.000,- sehingga keuntungan bersih yang diperolehnya Rp. 800.000,- setelah dikurangi biaya pemeliharaan. Walaupun keuntungan yang diperolehnya tidak banyak tapi Made Parma tetap bersyukur karena keluarganya bisa hidup dari hasil usahanya tersebut. Keinginannya untuk memperbaiki rumahnya membuatnya terpacu untuk mulai menyisihkan sedikit hasil usahanya ini sehingga setelah terkumpul banyak nantinya Made Parma bisa memperbaiki rumahnya. Setelah menerima pinjaman modal usaha dari DINARI Made Parma menjadi lebih bersemangat lagi dalam usahanya karena harapannya untuk mengembangkan usahanya bisa terpenuhi lewat pinjaman ini."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":80470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

But with 9 kids to clothe, feed and send to school, life was very tight for the L. family. This is why Evelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon: to get the badly needed capital to increase their family's income capacity. This venture earns them an average of PHP 3,000.00 per month. \r\n\r\nBy the grace of God, in the 10 years that she has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon, Evelyn has kept a good credit record, and her older children have already finished their schooling.\r\n\r\nFor this 18th loan cycle, Evelyn is borrowing PHP 22,000.00 to buy more livestock to raise and sell. Evelyn and her husband continue to strive and work hard in the hope that their children will have a better life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

For the past three months, Sra. Lucia has been selling food to the farm workers.  At an early hour, she leaves to buy food in order to prepare her dishes.

Mukaram is 53 years old. She is divorced and has one child. For many years she tried various types of the activities. Finally, three years ago together with her son she started a business selling cell phones. Mukaram believes that this business is profitable and the generated income allows her to support her family. \r\n\r\nHowever, Mukaram thinks that it is expensive to purchase the cell phones locally and it will save funds considerably to purchase the goods in China. For this purpose Mukaram requests 5,100 Somoni. Being a first time borrower, Mukaram is grateful to all supporting her and promises to repay the loan promptly.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Here we meet Francisca, who is 60. Her life companion passed away and she has been left alone, but she has four children from that relationship, all grown, one of whom lives with her. She learned dressmaking several years ago. She has a small dressmaking workshop where she has made clothing for many years. However, what she makes most are sheets, which she later sells to customers who request her work. She also sells Forlive brand natural products, sales that she makes at the same time as she sells her work. She works every day from 6 am to 10 pm, and sometimes later when she has orders to fill.

Her previous loan of PHP 25,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Flora has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,600, lifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000. She intends to use this to buy more products to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and house repairs. Flora is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

of Thanh Ho\u00e1. C\u1ea7u is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 50 Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng (18.6.50 Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng). \r\n\r\nC\u1ea7u is widowed and has five adult children. To making a living, C\u1ea7u raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising chickens for sale. C\u1ea7u has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 1,000,000 Vietnamese dong (VND) a month from these activities. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, C\u1ea7u joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. C\u1ea7u has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND which will also be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell. This loan will be the fourth loan she has taken out from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. C\u1ea7u plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group: \r\n\r\n1. H. Th\u1ecb H\u01b0\u01a1ng (2) is a 31-year-old woman who is requesting a 6,000,000 VND loan to support her furniture-making business. \r\n\r\n2. N. Th\u1ecb Thanh (6) is a 53-year-old woman who is requesting a 6,000,000 VND loan to support her livestock raising business. \r\n\r\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women: \r\n\r\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders. \r\n\r\nC\u1ea7u L\u00ea Th\u1ecb (three) l\u00e0 61 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

","en":"Estevana, 50, works selling fried products and natural juices made with regional tropical fruits such as guava, avocado, pineapple, mango, tamarind, soursop, etc.  The idea for her business came up when she was working with a woman who was selling frozen and fried snacks in a hotel in the historic district.  She decided to do the same on her own, so she began with a small amount of working capital and little by little it has grown.\r\n\r\nHer competition grows every day and her expenses are more than those of the competition, which has better prices.  This is because she buys almost daily in smaller quantities, and her transportation expenses are higher.  Also, she does not earn discounts for her purchases because of the small quantities in which she gets her products, since her working capital is insufficient to get volume sales.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason she is coming for a Kiva loan, the first loan request she has made to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With it she will buy food supplies wholesale, which will allow her to compete with good prices and a better profit margin.  Likewise, as she has new customers in the area stores, she will be able to respond to their requests opportunely, just as she has planned it with her Kiva loan, with which she also will buy a display case to make a better display of her fried snacks.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":965449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy food supplies wholesale and a display case.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-28T16:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estevana Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":75157},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":82355},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84277},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":86243},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88256},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90315},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92422},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100975}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.12},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.26,"local_amount":75157,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:31Z","rounded_local_amount":77284.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325069},{"amount":44.12,"local_amount":82355,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":84685.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039127},{"amount":45.15,"local_amount":84277,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":86662.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651269},{"amount":46.2,"local_amount":86243,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":88683.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140874},{"amount":47.28,"local_amount":88256,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":90753.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100768},{"amount":48.38,"local_amount":90315,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":92871.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338389},{"amount":49.52,"local_amount":92422,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":95037.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301394970},{"amount":54.09,"local_amount":100975,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":103832.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774796}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T17:10:28Z","paid_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":384471,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vilma is a 45-year-old married woman with two children aged 16 and 7.
