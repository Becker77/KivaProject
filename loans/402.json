After four solidarity loans, she has moved on to an individual loan. All previous loans were repaid successfully. She buys her stock mainly in Bobo Dioulasso (a town in the West African republic of Burkina Faso) and sometimes in Bamako (Mali\u2019s capital). She plans to use this loan to buy 20 cases of fish and ice on a daily basis. She sells every day along Highway 2000 in M\u00e9dine, S\u00e9gou. Sales are midway between wholesale and retail, or retail, and are generally paid for in cash.  Because of the quick turnover of fish, she expects to make a monthly profit of CFA 90,000. This profit will be used to pay the interest on the loan, to pay for ice, for savings, and to contribute to the family\u2019s expenses.

Shuhrat is 25 years old and has been married for about two years. His wife is a housekeeper.\r\n<p>\r\nShuhrat has been running his business for about two years. He rents a retail store where he sells different kinds of housewares. His business is the family\u2019s main source of income. Shuhrat is trying to have a wide range of goods of good quality to meet the requirements of his customers and to satisfy the needs of clients with different levels of income.\r\n<p>\r\nToday, Shuhrat requests $3000 for the term of 12 months. This is the first time that Shuhrat has asked for a loan through IMON International and Kiva. It will be used to buy more housewares in order to increase the range of his goods. Due to the profitability of his business, the determination of this micro-entrepreneur and his experience in the business, this customer is qualified to receive this loan. \r\n<p><br>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":319918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

For over 16 years he has worked extracting lumber from the deepest and most hidden areas of the Peruvian jungle.  Since he got married, he also began to plant coffee on his in-laws' farmlands.  What he likes to do most on his spare time (while they are waiting for harvesting), though, is to fell trees.  He does this from 4am until 2pm and then, with great speed, agility in his hands and dexterity in handling his machines, he cuts them into lumber according to the measurements and sizes requested.  He is able to deliver his orders quickly and this provides him with good earnings.  He is the only one in town that does this which makes it very profitable since all his neighbors require the service in order to build their wood houses.

She is 31 years old. Bemma is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Shasta Daisy 1.\r\n\r\nBemma is married and has 1 infant-aged child. To make a living, Bemma owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as eggs, noodles, salt, sugar, shampoo, soap, & toothpaste in the local community. Bemma has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Bemma joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Bemma is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Bemma from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Leonora earns by buying supplies at the wholesale price and selling retail in single quantities. Her store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 350 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Leonora is requesting a Php 35,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n \r\nLeonora dreams of being able to give her grandchild a good and high-quality education through all her hard work in her business.

Remedios finished only high school, but for her, dreaming does not end even at the age of 55. She is married to Jaime, a retired Philippine Air Force personnel, and together they live in Pasay City, Philippines along with their three children.\r\n\r\nRemedios currently manages a computer shop, which caters to the youth and working professionals in her community. Being fourteen years in business, Remedios knows how to handle her business well, and makes around Php500 per day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue with the operation of her business, Remedios has applies for a Php12,000 loan. She intends to use this money to buy materials such as keyboards and printers needed in order for her computer shop to function more efficiently. She also has in mind other equipment which she would buy to add to her business. She hopes to earn enough profit to pay her loans and buy modern computers for her computer shop.\r\n\r\nRemedios is challenged by customers who do not pay their dues on time. Remedios always keeps in mind personal debts which she has yet to pay. However. She knows that happiness would surely come her way as long as she perseveres to go above her challanges. She anticipates seeing her children surpass her achievements by finishing college with flying colors. Soon, it will be, for her, a happy ending.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance

What Nora doesn't like about her work is that some of her customers have delayed making payments to her.\r\n\r\nNora says that she would like to start out in a new business selling food.  This will be her fifth loan from MFP and she hopes to receive a small loan so that she can achieve her goals.  She says that she feels comfortable being a member of her community bank as she knows the other members and considers them to be good people.  Nora will use the sum that she has requested (1,000 soles) to invest in buying all kinds of clothes wholesale to sell during the Christmas season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":938828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more clothes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-07T00:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":148.74},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":159.72},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":159.09},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":171.6},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":178.01},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":182.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.78},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.89},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.78,"local_amount":148.74,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":150.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836276},{"amount":59.89,"local_amount":159.72,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:19Z","rounded_local_amount":161.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246036},{"amount":59.66,"local_amount":159.09,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":160.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386056},{"amount":199.67,"local_amount":532.45,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:42Z","rounded_local_amount":538.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202183}],"funded_date":"2011-12-20T16:11:11Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":371807,"name":"Solange","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme SOLANGE est  mari\u00e9e  et m\u00e8re de 03 enfants.

She is a street vendor who sells medicinal drinks for a living - nothing more than an assortment of infusions with health benefits.  She works from 6:00 until 8:00 in the morning, and then later from 6:00 to 9:00 or 10:00 in the evening, which leaves time for her to watch her children.  The good part about her business is that it provides good income since Liduvina shows lots of effort and dedication.  She leaves the house early to find more customers, and comes home late to make more money.  This is her first loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  With the money she will purchase a larger supply of infusions for making her remedies and will refurbish her tricycle with new wheels.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelly Wester, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":240561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a larger supply of infusions for her preparations","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-20T14:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liduvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":77.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228215},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":77.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423447},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:13Z","rounded_local_amount":77.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116709},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":77.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011640},{"amount":25.13,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":77.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595263},{"amount":24.39,"local_amount":65,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":75.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989465}],"funded_date":"2008-12-20T14:29:08Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelly Wester","image":null}},{"id":84120,"name":"Kararaka- Asiyo Colostine Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Colostine A.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

This is what has led her to request her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 2500 nuevos soles, which she plans to invest in the repair and general maintenance of her source of income. \r\n\r\nCarla dreams of owning a fleet of vehicles dedicated to public transportation as well as pursuing a technical degree in administration in order to continue supporting her family.\r\n\r\nShe is a very responsible young woman whose neighbors greatly respect her because she is always happy to help when needed.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amanda McDermott, Kiva

She has a clothing sales stand in the Barrio Lindo New Fair on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  She needs working capital because sales tend to increase during the final months of the year because she sells every day during December leading up to the end-of-year holidays.  She has two young children who are still too young to go to school.  Her partner works as a cashier in a pharmacy every day which means that she, besides tending to her business, must care for her children.  She and her partner hope to be able to buy a house next year and pay for it little by little with profits from their business to give their family a comfortable environment and to be able to become independent.

She lives in the country in Punto Cuatro, a rural area that belongs to the Mochum\u00ed agricultural district.  This is part of the Lambayeque province and is forty minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe has been working for two years selling beauty products from a catalogue.  She offers these products to the neighbors in her area.  She currently has a group of loyal customers that always go to her to order the products they need.  Jackeline is never satisfied and she is always looking for new customers.  The company that supplies the products to her usually gives her more points the more customers she attracts so she earns more.\r\n\r\nShe also works preparing typical cakes and sweets which she sells from her home.  With her earnings she helps her husband with family expenses.  He works in a garage.\r\n\r\nJackeline wants to acquire beauty products on her own to set up a small sales stand in her home that is permanently stocked.  This would allow her to give her customers better service by having the products on hand and not having to wait until the end of the month to get them when the order arrives.\r\n\r\nIn order to reach her goal she saw that she needed to apply for a loan of 1000 PEN for the first time with Edpyme Alternativa.   Her neighbors where she lives consider her quite a calm and responsible person.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Haynes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":562710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase cosmetics to expand catalogue sales business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Punto Cuatro - Mochum\u00ed - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-06-30T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackeline Baltazara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":87.69},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.51},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.49},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":97.19},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.29},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":103.58},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.72},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.36},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":114.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.19},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.36},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.84},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.77},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.19,"local_amount":85.83,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:55Z","rounded_local_amount":90.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618447},{"amount":32.88,"local_amount":87.69,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:57Z","rounded_local_amount":92.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832843},{"amount":34.69,"local_amount":92.51,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":98.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099445},{"amount":35.81,"local_amount":95.49,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":101.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554838},{"amount":36.45,"local_amount":97.19,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:57Z","rounded_local_amount":102.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530238},{"amount":38.36,"local_amount":102.29,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":108.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666366},{"amount":38.84,"local_amount":103.58,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":109.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409695},{"amount":40.77,"local_amount":108.72,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":115.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108137},{"amount":85.01,"local_amount":226.7,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":240.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270271}],"funded_date":"2010-07-01T00:13:58Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:49:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sue Haynes","image":null}},{"id":216072,"name":"Elma Guimalon Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elma G. is from the village of Bunawan Calamba, Misamis Occidental.

He will use the money to buy seeds and fertilizer for his fields. Khusen thanks all who support him.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: sari-sari (general) store and a gasoline retailing business.  Her husband Ricky A., who is 41 years old, works as a pay-load operator to earn his living.  They have 3 children who are between the ages 3 to19 years old.  \r\n\r\nGina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP helped her increase her monthly profit to 30,000 PHP,  increasing the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she could continue to save up for the future purchase of a second hand tricycle to use as another income source. Gina A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

She was an employee of her province' general store.  When it disintegrated, her life became much more difficult because her husband was away in the army and she was the sole bread-winner of her family (with two kids at school).  In 2002 Mrs. P. borrowed 50USD to buy vegetable and sell it in the local market.  When another store was about to disintegrate, she found it a good opportunity to buy those household products at cheap price for her grocery store.  With her great experience and the high demand of local people and students from nearby schools, her store always attracts a lot of customers with a variety of products.  The smile on her face proves how her life has improved.  Her husband is now retired and helping her with her store.  Her oldest son graduated from college and starts to work.  Mrs. P. would like to borrow 450USD to invest more on her business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Anh Hoai Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nC\u00f4 Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ph\u1ea5n, 52 tu\u1ed5i, s\u1ed1ng t\u1ea1i ph\u01b0\u1eddng Xu\u00e2n H\u00f2a, th\u1ecb x\u00e3 Ph\u00fac Y\u00ean l\u00e0 nh\u00e2n vi\u00ean HTX d\u1ecbch v\u1ee5 t\u1ed5ng h\u1ee3p c\u0169, sau khi chuy\u1ec3n \u0111\u1ed5i c\u01a1 ch\u1ebf HTX gi\u1ea3i th\u1ec3, khi \u0111\u00f3 cu\u1ed9c s\u1ed1ng gia \u0111\u00ecnh c\u00f4 g\u1eb7p nhi\u1ec1u kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n, ch\u1ed3ng c\u00f4 \u0111ang c\u00f2n trong qu\u00e2n ng\u0169, m\u1ed9t m\u00ecnh c\u00f4 xoay s\u1edf nu\u00f4i 2 con \u0103n h\u1ecdc.

Ni Kadek Artini wishes that her hog farming can grow without further buying piglets from other farmers or insemination. Good boar typically is 8 or 10 month old. An old enough boar can be loaned to breed other farmers' sow. Each week 3 to 5 people loan Ni Kadek Artini's boar for 50,000 IDR. Each week the boar can produce 150,000 IRD to 250,000 IDR. Ni Kadek Artini maintains the quality of feed given to her boar. Beside polard and concentrate, Ni Kadek Artini also feed the boar with free range chicken eggs to maintain the boar's condition to breed a high quality piglets. The meat producing side costs 500,000 IDR for animal feed, giving her a gross of 900,000 IDR. Hence the total income from breeding and meat producing is 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 IDR per month\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDari dulu Ni Kadek Artini berkeinginan untuk pelihara pejantan dan penggemukan.

Ni Kadek Artini berkeinginan supaya usaha ternak babinya bisa berkembang biak tanpa harus membeli bibit di peternak lain atau memakai kawin suntik. Pejantan yang bagus berumur 8 atau 10 bulan. Pejantan yang sudah cukup umur, bisa disewakan untuk mengawini induk peternak lainnya. Setiap satu minggu, 3 s\/d 5 orang yang menyewa pejantan milik Ni Kadek Artini dengan ongkos Rp. 50.000.- sekali kawin. Dalam satu minggu, penghasilan yang didapat dari pejantan bisa mencapai Rp.150,000,- s\/d Rp.250,000,-. Ni Kadek Artini menjaga sekali mutu makanan yang diberi untuk pejantannya. Selain dedak padi dan konsentrat, Ni Kadek Artini juga memberi  telur ayam kampung supaya kondisinya tetap kuat dan sehat sehingga mampu menghasilkan keturunan yang berkwalitas. Sedangkan untuk penggemukan sampai panen menghabiskan pakan Rp.500.000.- dengan hasil kotor Rp. 900.000.- . Jadi keuntungan bersih pejantan dan penggemukan per bulan rata-rata Rp.1.000,000,- s\/d

She started her business with Rp 150,000 as the initial capital. The business gives her Rp 125,000 income a week. Even though earns small amount, she is not pessimistic. Ni Komang Sutarsini manages her business diligently to help her husband who is a truck driver paying their two children tuition fees with a hope seeing their bright future.

Untuk menyiasati hal ini kebanyakan dari mereka memilih untuk mengadakan segala sarana ritual tersebut dengan membeli yang sudah jadi sehingga tidak perlu membuat lagi. Hal inilah yang membuat Ni Komang Sutarsini melihat peluang yang besar dalam usaha produksi jajanan seperti: jajan uli, satuh, pelpelan (rengginang) yang juga termasuk salah satu bagian dari sarana ritual tersebut.\r\nMemulai usaha dengan modal Rp  150.000,- setiap minggunya usaha produksi jajan ini memberikan keuntungan Rp 125.000,-. Walaupun keuntungan yang diperolehnya tidak banyak namun hal ini tidak membuatnya berkecil hati. Dengan tekun usaha ini dikelolanya untuk membantu suaminya yang bekerja sebagai sopir truk pasir, menyekolahkan kedua anak  mereka supaya bisa sukses dan memiliki masa depan yang cerah. Keinginannya untuk bisa hidup lebih baik membuatnya tambah semangat apalagi setelah mendapat pinjaman modal usaha dari DINARI yang kemudian dipergunakan untuk meningkatkan omzetnya dengan membeli bahan baku dan produksi jajan lebih banyak

Thanks to her son they constructed the house where they now live peacefully.  She has always sold a variety of products, an activity that came to her in the streets of her city as she worked in travelling sales.  With the passing of the years she had serious health problems that impeded her abilities to carry on her work as a travelling saleswoman.  However, her son supported her in constructing a store in her home; which she has been running for two years.  Since then she has given all of her attention to her store, everyday from 6:00 in the morning until 11:00 at night.  But her working hours are less because the store is in her home and her home activities are not disrupted.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. Additionally, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They never had any children.  This hardworking gentleman is dedicated to his farm work.  At a young age, he learned by watching all the necessary techniques that are needed to plant and harvest crops.  When he got married, Cipriano continued with his farm work and now has the help of his wife.  He says that the land in this part of the country is very fertile.  For this reason he is growing beans, potatoes, and peas.  The work in the fields is never easy, but Cipriano cares for his crops with great dedication.  His farm work begins every day when he wakes up at dawn.  He applies the necessary substances, such as compost and fertilizers, to prepare the land for a productive harvest.  When the time comes, he will hire workers to help gather the crops to sell to the wholesalers who offer good prices.  The income he earns allows him to save and live comfortably with his wife.  Being an enterprising individual, he plans to grow more peas since the price is very good at the market.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his fourth loan with MFP.  Cipriano is satisfied with the work of his Communal Bank because all the members complete their payments on time.  He will invest the loan he requested in the purchase of seeds for planting peas and beans.  Cipriano will begin planting in the month of May, so he wants to have everything he needs to begin a successful crop.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Julie has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Julie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julie is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Julie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Her dream is to reach her goals as a family, to see her children grow into professional adults and she plans to do so caring for her business, getting more loans and saving through Esperanza.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate started with us because she needed to invest capital in her business and because she believes in the program.  Her history is being used to exemplify her other group members as well as clients of Esperanza, both the Haitians (who for the most part have emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti, some of them quite recently) as well as the Dominicans who generally live in very poor communities like this zone and many others like it in the Dominican Republic which have few resources; they lack drinking water and reliable electricity.\r\n\r\nThis group is located in an area of few resources called Puerto Plata, a city whose economy depends primarily on real estate and Tourism although the latter has recently been overshadowed by new, emerging tourist areas.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":612570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They engage in a variety of business activities such as general retail, providing services, and other trades.  A short time ago they learned about the benefits offered by Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, so they decided to join together in order to access the loans provided by the organization.  This is their first loan as a Communal Bank and they hope to do very well so that they can continue receiving loans.\r\n<p>\r\nIt is in this place where Sra. Virginia lives.  She is 24 years old, married, and has a five-year-old son who is in kindergarten.  Her husband is an auto mechanic.  Virginia is a young homemaker who sells clothes through catalogs of various brands so that she can earn her own income.  She works four days a week by going door-to-door and taking orders.  Virginia offers her products on credit and collects payment each week.  She takes advantage of the morning hours while her son is at school and has been able to improve her sales.  Virginia receives her products at a distribution center.  She has been in business for more than a year and has done very well.\r\n<p>\r\nHer loan will be used to buy trousers, shirts, blouses, and children\u2019s clothing since she has several orders.  This is her first loan cycle with the Communal Bank.  Virginia serves as the president and enjoys the speed by which she was able to secure the loan.  Her dream is to continue forward in her business.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4075,"image":{"id":964702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy trousers, shirts, blouses, and children\u2019s clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-12-29T11:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4075,"lender_count":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia Lisseth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinthia Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zobeida Armandina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nereida Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Kenedy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephanie Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yenny Aracely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Holger Amador","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Asunci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanessa Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4070,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":508.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":508.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":508.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":508.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":508.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":508.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":508.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":508.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":509.38},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":509.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1018.75,"local_amount":1017.5,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1018.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257183287},{"amount":1018.75,"local_amount":1017.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1018.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263318916},{"amount":1018.75,"local_amount":1017.5,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1018.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033782},{"amount":1018.75,"local_amount":1017.5,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1018.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645860}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T21:17:03Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:37:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":380034,"name":"Gloria Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Gloria, continua vendiendo en su pulperia, en donde su objetivo es invertir mas en productos, ya que tiene poco en mercaderia, ya que ha sido un a\u00f1o dificil para ella,  primeramente se enfermo de sus pies, y luego su hermano murio, en donde tuvo que hacer gastos.\nSiempre cuenta con el apoyo economico de su esposo, quien vende productos lacteos, sus hijos trabajando, y hoy con esta nuevo financiamiento desea, comprar en mas cantidad, productos de granos basicos en quintales de arroz, frijoles, azucar, maiz, caja de jabon, bidon de aceite, golosinas, productos de la coca cola, cereales y otros que son mas demandados por los clientes.\nLo cual espera poder seguir equilibrando sus ventas y tener mejores ganancias.\n","en":"Gloria continues to sell goods in her grocery store, and her goal is to invest in more products as she doesn't have much in stock because it has been a difficult year for her.

She left school after the third graD. because her mother did not have the means for her to continue her education.  She has four children, none of whom rely on her economically.  Telvina is engaged in selling groceries in her neighborhood's market.  The first business she started was selling clothing but she had to put this asiD. to care for her children.  She was selling condiments and plasticware for almost five years until she acquired her stand in the market where she now sells groceries.  With her earnings she has been able to build her stand in the El Cortijo market where she is currently developing her business.

He has been a farmer since a very young age but this occupation does not provide him with steady income to contribute to his family's support so 5 years ago he acquired a mototaxi (a motorized, 3-wheel vehicle used to transport passengers and cargo) with which he works when he isn't doing his farming chores.

ella est\u00e1 acostumbrada a caminar  diariamente, desde las 6: 00 A.m. hasta las 11:00 A.m. recorriendo mas de 10 barrios aleda\u00f1os a su vivienda en Villalozano, ubicada en el municipio de Soledad - Atl\u00e1ntico.\n\nSobeida sinti\u00f3 la necesidad de trabajar cuando su esposo muri\u00f3 dej\u00e1ndola con 5 hijos, al principio fue empleada dom\u00e9stica,  pero una amiga viendo la necesidad y la tristeza  que expresaba al dejar a sus hijos menores solos,  le recomend\u00f3 buscar un negocio independiente que le permitiera atender de cerca a sus hijos y a la vez generar ingresos; fue as\u00ed como con su ayuda se inici\u00f3 en la venta de pescado y mariscos, negocio del cual se siente orgullosa porque con el sostiene su hogar, apoya el estudio de sus hijas y hasta compr\u00f3 una nueva mejora y se traslad\u00f3 a ella arrendando la vivienda que le dej\u00f3 su marido al morir, la cual representa un nuevo ingreso.\n\nAunque Sobeida no estudi\u00f3 sabe lo importante que es educarse para la vida por esos su m\u00e1ximo prop\u00f3sito es que sus dos peque\u00f1as hijas de  13 y 15 a\u00f1os lleguen  a ser profesionales, para eso les ense\u00f1a a ser persistentes y  les proporciona lo necesario para que Angie Paola cumpla su sue\u00f1o de ser fisioterapeuta y Marcela tenga la oportunidad de estudiar y ser profesional de la hoteler\u00eda y el turismo. \n\nEl negocio de Sobeida tiene m\u00e1s de 5 a\u00f1os, pero solo ingres\u00f3 a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo desde hace dos, a ella le recomend\u00f3 su amiga Diosa, que tambi\u00e9n es financiada por esta entidad, porque observaba que sus deudas con pagadiario \u201cno le rend\u00edan el dinero por los onerosos intereses que pagaba\u201d;

It is then she takes her cooler full of ice, fish and seafood, puts it in her wheelbarrow and goes off happily fulfilling the orders she took from customers the previous day. Sobeida is used to walking daily between 6 and 11 a.m., traveling through more than 10 neighborhoods surrounding her home in Villalozano, Soledad - Atl\u00e1ntico. She felt the need to work when her husband died, leaving her with five children. At first she was a housemaid, but a friend saw the sadness she showed in leaving her small children alone and recommended that she look for an independent business that would allow her to be close to her children and at the same time generate income. This is how she started selling fish and seafood, a business that she feels proud of because it is her family's sustenance. The business supports her children's education and even helped her buy a new and improved home that the family moved to, and she rents the home her husband left her when he died, which adds to her income. Although Sobeida didn't go to school, she knows the importance of education in life, and for this reason her biggest goal is for her two small daughters, ages 13 and 15, to become successful. That is why she teaches them to be persistent and provides what is necessary for Angie Paola to fulfill her dream of being a physical therapist and for Marcela to have the opportunity to study hotel management and tourism and become a professional. Sobeida's business is more than five years old, but she has only worked with Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for the past two years after her friend Diosa, also a client of the institution, recommended it to her after seeing her debt payments. \"Don't give up your money to the onerous interest you pay,\" she told her. This is how Sobeida came to request financing, and since then she has taken out two loans, the latest of which she plans to use to purchase higher volumes of fish and specialty seafoods. She tells us that her clientele has grown to more than 100 customers and her goal is to make some basic adjustments to her new home with her added income. In the future she wants to set up a sales post selling seafood cocktails prepared with delicious sauces, cilantro and onions picked from the outskirts of her neighborhood, and the people will walk from far away to enjoy her delicacies. Her customers prefer her products because she shows them how to prepare the fish by using unique recipes, which adds to the value of her business. It is very normal to see Sobeida explaining to housewives and small restaurant owners how to add carrots, beans, garlic, onion, lemon pepper to their fish, season it to taste, tie it with string and put it to roast. This is her famous Cabrito, which is served with fried plantain or cassava, green salad and sweet water. This is how she won the hearts of her customers and positioned herself to sell her exquisite products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

Occidental. She earns her living as a Pepsi products wholesaler and operating a general store business. Her husband Escolastico, who is 56 years old, is a businessman, and also helps in Florentina's business activities. They have four children who are 20 to 27 years old.\r\n\r\nFlorentina  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her previous 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florentina has been incrementally lifting her family's quality of life by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 20th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 26,000, which she intends to use as capital so she can sell soft drinks in the local school canteen, and expand her business.  She will continue to save up for future business improvements so that she can help in the education of her niece, nephew and her extended family. Florentina C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He learned about Hluvuku through coworkers who are also clients of the organization.

Micro-financing permits people who have limited resources and have a small business to have an opportunity as a business-person in the labor market.\r\n\r\nJose began his business renting sound systems and animation service to parties and festivities that take place in the city of Caman\u00e1.  He is able to earn an average of 450 soles from his weekly contracts,  which allows him to save a small quantity of money for the quiet season.\r\n\r\nThanks to the loan of 1,000 soles that he will receive thanks to Kiva, Jose will be able to purchase two large speakers to improve the sound quality at the events where he is hired, and so be able to gain recommendations for other clients from his current ones.  The trust that's being put in him allows him to think of a better future, and with great effort and dedication he will be able to purchase a plot of land, where he wants to build his own home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":938906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase two large speakers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caman\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-07T16:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":84.26},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":93.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105.19},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":108.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":112.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":116.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.6},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.7},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.18},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.6,"local_amount":84.26,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":85.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142493},{"amount":32.75,"local_amount":87.34,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":88.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271084},{"amount":69.92,"local_amount":186.45,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:12Z","rounded_local_amount":188.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993736},{"amount":36.8,"local_amount":98.13,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":99.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601641},{"amount":37.86,"local_amount":100.96,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":102.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090774},{"amount":39.44,"local_amount":105.19,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":106.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294297952},{"amount":40.69,"local_amount":108.5,"processed_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":109.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301350746},{"amount":42.18,"local_amount":112.48,"processed_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":113.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308108387},{"amount":43.76,"local_amount":116.69,"processed_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:11:27Z","rounded_local_amount":118.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315344553}],"funded_date":"2012-01-04T14:28:15Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:11:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":371855,"name":"Samiah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samiah is a 40-year-old married woman from Al Hashmi, Amman, Jordan.

She had 13 children, of which 4 are still living and 3 of those live at home. When her husband was alive they planted large areas of citrus fruits, bananas and coffee in her in-law\u00b4s fields. But now her harvests have diminished because her children do not like agricultural work and she cannot work with the same intensity as when she was younger. Since then, six months ago, she began selling candies with the help of her son who works in Lima and sends her the merchandise. But she still would like to improve her business with display cases, shelves and greater inventory so she can compete with her neighbors, get more income and improve her standard of living and not just rely on the harvest of her crops, which often do not live up to her expectations.

S. was born in the Inhambane province of the Vilanculos district (790 km north of Maputo). She is married and is the mother of 2 children between the ages of 21 and 24. Her first son works in a business in Boane while the other studies. She stopped her studies in the 5th grade because her parents did not believe in the value of education. <p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\n\r\nShe has lived in Boane more than 10 years, having come from Maputo, where she moved with her whole family, in her own home with her mother, whom she supports. Her husband works in the Cimentos de Mo\u00e7ambique (Cements of Mozambique) factory while she has run the business for the last 12 months without employees. <p\/> \r\n<p\/>\r\nShe learned how to run the business during her 24 years in the Fajardo market in the city of Maputo. She sells grains (corn which she buys at 120,00 MT per sack and sells for 255,00 MT per sack). They bring in a daily revenue of 2.500,00MT and she saves the money in a traditional rotating method (called an xitique). <p\/>\r\n\r\n<p\/>\r\nShe has never taken out a loan with any other bank. She learned of Hluvuku-Adsema (a Kiva partner) through her neighbors and has been given 3 loans (10.000,00MT; 20.000,00MT and 30.000,00MT), all for her business.<p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nWith this loan of 15.000,00MT she hopes to buy more products (corn and other grains) to fortify her business. She decided to ask for a smaller loan than before because of the saturation of the market. <p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nShe plans to pay without problems so that she can take out more loans with the objective of expanding into new areas and to hire workers to help with marketing.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michelle Harrison, Kiva

She lives in her own home with her two children: Jhon, 3, and Lizbeth, 1, for whom she wants to make a better life. Ana spends her time knitting sweaters, scarves, gloves, etc., which she sells to clothing shops. Her knitted products sell very well and are in high demand. She works hard to satisfy her customers, and this has allowed her to provide her family with a good income. Weaving is Ana's favourite part of her work, and she does so with great skill. She has been weaving for nine years, and still considers it the most difficult way to make a garment. Ana hopes to one day have her own clothing store, where she will be able to sell her own work and further improve her family's income. This is Ana's fifth loan with MFP; she's already putting money away so that she'll be able to make her payments on time. She is happy to be a member of her community bank, and doesn't wish to cause it any problems. With her loan, Ana will be able to buy more wool, which will allow her to make more garments and offer more variety to the shops that sell her work. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":379485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buying wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-30T01:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":173.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081266},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":173.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997417},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":173.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842762},{"amount":174.65,"local_amount":499,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-16T10:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":516.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734339}],"funded_date":"2009-08-30T01:39:03Z","paid_date":"2010-01-16T10:47:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":137467,"name":"Ber\u00e9e Plus Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Guislain B. est pr\u00e9sident de la Banque Communautaire d\u00e9nomm\u00e9e \u00ab Ber\u00e9e Plus \u00bb,  compos\u00e9e de 27 micro-entrepreneurs qui ont solidairement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de contracter des cr\u00e9dits aupr\u00e8s des pr\u00e9teurs du monde \u00e0 travers Kiva.\nGuislain g\u00e8re sa propre maison de Pompe fun\u00e8bre et poss\u00e8de aussi une petite usine de production d\u2019eau pure dans la partie nordique de Kinshasa.

She is 38 years old and the mother of an adolescent son.  She makes a living by selling garments, which she does in her house, after bringing her merchandise back from the city of Lima to sell.

A desire for a happy home and a successful business venture is something Helen is working hard to obtain. Evelyn is ever determined to break people's low expectations of her. She is a CCT* community partner and is married to Romeo, an auto mechanic. They live in Caloocan City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nHelen's home serves both as an abode of rest and a venue for business, because at her home she has set up a sari-sari (variety) store to earn a living. She sells a wide range of products to the neighborhood, which includes items from rice and noodles to detergent powder and soap bars. With this, Evelyn earns a net average of PHP400 per day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Helen is requesting for a PHP20,000 loan. Adding more products to her store is a priority for her to improve her business, and the money from the loan would certainly be used to purchase these additional products. She looks forward to making the store grow and eventually to expand.\r\n\r\nAt present, Helen finds it hard to follow up customers who do not pay their debts on time. But just like any other hardworking entrepreneur, Helen sees to it that no challenge will ever wear her out.

She lives in Valladolid, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard on her vegetable farm, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 13,000. Ronita is borrowing PHP 19,500 so that she could purchase seeds, fertilizers and other farm inputs. This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Ronita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.
