Vegetable cultivation is the most profitable, producing a large quantity of products that get a good price in the local market in the zone. In the future Clorinda wants to acquire more land where she can continue to produce more. This is her tenth loan with MFP and she is very content to know that she has financial support. She has always been responsible with her repayments, and is thankful to be part of a communal bank as all the members are responsible and supportive people. Clorinda is thankful that the members will be guarantors for the loan she is seeking, as it will be very useful for her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His business is a colmado, a place where you can find all the ingredients to make your daily food.

He will use the profits to proviD. for his home, and to pay for his children's education.  One of his dreams is to see them become professional. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate's story is representative of his group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti). His group is located in the city of Hato Mayor, one of the country\u2019s most rural cities whose economy depends on agriculture.

She sells her livestock during the season when the fairs come to town. She is also involved in agriculture, cultivating potatoes, corn, and fava beans. She sells the products after every harvest, lasting about 6 months. So while she waits to sell her livestock she is still able to earn an income.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Others are engaged in the production of livestock; they purchase cattle and fatten them and reproduce them so that they can improve their breeds and sell their calves.  In addition they produce dairy products from the cows, such as fresh milk and natural yogurts and cheeses.  Other members sell dry products such as seeds, lima beans, corn, cereals and beans, among others.

They are small-scale entrepreneurs in Makeni City, who want a loan of Le 2,000,000 (or SLL 500,000 each) to enable them to improve their businesses. This is the first loan these entrepreneurs will be accessing from SMT\/Kiva. With the help of this loan, they will be able to expand their businesses; sales will thus improve and so also will their sales-to-profit-margin. With a larger profit at their disposal, they will be able to better look after themselves and their children.  <P>\r\n\r\nThe leader of this group is Fatmata K. on the left.

Since she was very young, she worked to help out her parents and thus learned everything she needed to cultivate the land and yield a good production. Every day she wakes up very early to tend to her potato and pea crops, which she previously planted with a lot of care and patience. Then, after numerous months of hard work, she hopes her efforts bear fruit and she can pick all her crops and transport them to the market, where she can sell them at a good price. This is what has transpired over the 12 years she has dedicated herself entirely to this activity. Furthermore, she says that she enjoys her work because she can continue the legacy passed down from her parents, as the land will help make headway for her family. In the future, she plans to plant larger quantities to increase her profits, which will help cover the costs of her children's education. This is her third loan cycle with Kiva partner MFP, and she is very certain this will help her increase her production. Her work with her community bank has been good, and all of the members are very responsible with their payments.

Sebab himpitan ekonomi terasa semakin berat saja, ditambah lagi harus menyekolahkan anaknya yang masih SMA serta menanggung seorang anaknya lagi yang belum bekerja. Melihat peluang dari beternak babi yang bisa menghasilkan keuntungan yang bagus maka Kadek ikut dalam program DINARI yang memberikan permodalan kepada para peternak babi di pedesaan. Pinjaman pertama dengan DINARI ini sebesar Rp.5000.000,- dengan jangka waktu 6 bulan dan pelunasan akan dilakukan pada akhir periode pinjaman. Pinjaman ini digunakan Kadek untuk membeli 4 ekor bibit babi penggemukan sebagai langkah awal dalam meningkatkan populasi serta pengembangan usahanya selain memang sudah ada induk babi di kandang miliknya. Pinjaman ini juga akan digunakan untuk membeli persediaan pakan selama 5 bulan kedepan. Dengan harga bibit per ekornya Rp.350.000,- diharapkan nantinya bisa dijual minimal Rp.1.500.000,- per ekor setelah 5 bulan pemeliharaan. Keuntungan yang dicapai per bulan diharapkan berkisar Rp.200.000,- sehingga bisa menambah penghasilan keluarganya.","en":"Ni Kadek Wiastini started farming pigs even before she got married.

She is 41 years old, and married with three school-aged children. To make a living, Josephine owns and operates a business venture in the food sector, making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Josephine has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 1000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Josephine joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to prepare food for sale. This loan will be her first from GDMPC. Josephine plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She\u2019s also started a business of her own in partnership with her sister: selling clothes for men, women and children where she\u2019s sure she\u2019ll do very well.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s a member of the \u201cLa Uni\u00f3n Hace la Fuerza del Palomar\u201d communal bank and this is the second MFP loan where she hopes to succeed with her communal bank which is composed of people committed to progress and which is the motivation for her to be punctual with her payments.\r\n\r\nIf Criss were to get your support, she\u2019ll use the requested money to buy several sacks of natural fertilizer to strengthen her coffee nursery and whatever\u2019s left over for her coffee plants which are in full growth phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":827284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy sacks of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-08T15:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chriss ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-17T08:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2053.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201864}],"funded_date":"2011-08-08T19:02:34Z","paid_date":"2012-06-17T08:12:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":327203,"name":"Alnie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alnie is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a motorcycle transport business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 10,000 through NWTF to purchase spare parts for motorcycle maintenance.\r\n\r\nAlnie has been in this business for eight years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She loves them very much and they are her reason for living. She is a very friendly, hard-working, and enthusiastic person who, together with her husband, puts all her effort into moving her family forward. Unfortunately, Elizabeth was unable to finish secondary school, because from the time she was young she had to work to help her parents with household expenses. But she would have liked to stud secretarial work. In her free time, she likes to walk through the warm and welcoming streets of her city and sometimes she makes a delicious chicken and rice dish to share with her family.\r\n\r\nThrough her own initiative, with a lot of effort and dedication, she works in her small business selling beauty products. She also has a small business selling candies and soft drinks. She works every day, from very early in the morning and she can work for about 10 hours. She likes her work and she believes that it is going well for her because of her good prices and the friendly way she treats her customers. She is very grateful to Kiva lenders, because thanks to them, she will be able to cover the expenses of the processing and formalization of the title to a small plot of land, which she bought a little while ago, and on which she will soon start building her own home. She will keep working and making an effort to achieve her great dream of seeing her son become a professional.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1241673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to cover expenses for the processing and formalization of the title to her land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":71.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":86.62},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":90.24},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":97.11},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":102.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":111.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":115.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":120.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.65},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.23},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Jones","image":1058194}},{"id":983660,"name":"Mishi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mishi is borrowing for the fourth time to renovate her fish stall and educate her children.

She does not have any employees except for contracting temporarily for shipments.  The principal foods that she sells are corn, beans, and peanuts.  She acquires a can of peanuts for 200MT and sells it for 450MT. She has had a monthly income of between 18,000MT to 20,000MT.

Mar\u00eda has a pupuser\u00eda, an eatery where she makes pupusas, mornings and nights.\r\n[A pupusa is a thick, hand-made corn biscuit-like flat bread (made using masa de ma\u00edz, a maize flour dough used in Latin American cuisine) that is stuffed with one or more of the following: cheese (queso) (usually a soft cheese called Quesillo found in all Central America), fried pork meat ground to a paste consistency (called chicharr\u00f3n, not to be confused with fried pork rind which is also known as chicharr\u00f3n in some other countries), squash (ayote), or (pataste), refried beans (frijoles refritos), or queso con loroco (loroco is a vine flower bud from Central America). There is also the pupusa revuelta with mixed ingredients, such as queso (cheese), frijoles (beans), and chicharr\u00f3n or bacon. Pupusas are similar to tortillas and especially to arepas. In fact, in El Salvador, normal tortillas are about the same diameter and thickness as pupusas, without the filling.)]  She needs financing because she would also like to start to sell basic food items as well as to be able to buy ingredients, like corn, beans and rice, that she needs for her pupusas.

The group is located in the Eben Ezer neighborhood of the city of Danli.  Here\u00b4s a description of the members\u00b4 businesses:\r\n\r\nSr. Manuel de Jesus R. C. operates a business making and selling sweets.  The business is called Dulces R.--nice play on Manuel\u00b4s name--and specializes in sweets made with bananas.  Manuel has operated the business for four years.  His customers come day after day to buy from him and he can\u00b4t always meet demand because he doesn\u00b4t have enough capital to buy the ingredients he needs for his sweets.  His products are popular because they\u00b4re delicious--\u00a8R.\u00a8--and priced right.  Manuel is married and his wife helps him with the business because demand is so great.  The couple has 2 children who also help with the business.\r\n\r\nSra. Arsenia A. has operated a business making and selling corn tortillas for more than six years.  She operates the business at home. She has won over her customers with big portions and the cleanliness of her kitchen.  Her customers are drawn from the Col. Eben Ezer and Col Bella Vista neighborhoods.  She makes the tortillas and sells some of them from her house and others from a corner shop.  Still others are delivered to regular customers.  Arsenia is married.  Her husband is also an entrepreneur, traveling around the \u00a8departamento\u00a8 of El Paraiso, selling a wide range of goods.  The couple has three children and they are 100% responsible for providing them with food, schooling, etc.\r\n\r\nSra. Gloria Marina F. Ordonez has operated a business making and selling donuts for about a year.  Gloria makes the donuts at home and sells them at two tobacco factories that are near her house, the factories\u00b4 employees being her target customers.  Gloria makes 100 donuts a day.  She sells them all but she can\u00b4t make more because she doesn\u00b4t have the capital to do so.  She would like to expand so everyone who wants her delicious donuts can buy them.  She tells us that her customers often ask for Osmil or juices but she can\u00b4t supply them because she doesn\u00b4t have enough money to invest in thermos bottles and ice to provide beverages to her customers.  Gloria is the single mother of three children.  Her former partner provides her with some support for food but it\u00b4s not enough to cover all the household\u00b4s expenses.  She started the business to cover the difference and it\u00b4s gone well so far.  She now needs a loan to help her meet the demand from her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":504163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Supplies for different food businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2010-03-13T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arsenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1576.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136735223},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1576.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144768680},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1576.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152086122},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T09:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1576.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159799963},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1576.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166905104},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1576.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172172954}],"funded_date":"2010-03-15T16:15:54Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":187910,"name":"Colette","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e en 1960 \u00e0 Ouidah, ville historique du B\u00e9nin, A.

Bertha has been working in a  farm since she was a little girl; her parents taught her everything about how to get a good crop. Now she takes care of her own land with lots of love and patience. She plants cocoa, coffee and coca leaves, and she sells her products in the city of San Francisco. What she likes about her job is the harvest and she feels that after 25 years of dedication, her hard work is paying off. The most difficult aspect of her job is to protect the crops from insect pests that can harm her plantations. Her greatest wish is to buy new land to increase the production. This is the fourth loan with MFP, aware that she has to pay according to schedule, and she is willing to do so.

He sells each bread loaf for PKRs 5, which is almost the same price in every city.   \r\nBushra has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, he will buy wood and flour in bulk and increase his sales. He has been doing this business for the past 10 years, and Bushra is very confident about the growth of his business in the future. \r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 3rd loan application. In previous loan years, she has proved herself  a responsible client who always paid her installments on time and never missed a single meeting. \r\nNote: \u201cIn the photo, the lady with a book

He lives independently at the home of his parents with his wife Damiana (age 29) and their beloved daughter Milagros (age 7).  They hope to provide her a better life.\r\n<p>\r\nFrom a young age, Wilmer learned from his parents how to work on a farm.  Every day he helped them with their work since he was conscious that his family\u2019s welfare depended on it.  He currently has his own land that he has cultivated with great success since now the welfare of his wife and daughter depend on his work.  What he enjoys most about his job is looking after his crops and feeling extremely happy when his harvests are large and abundant.  Wilmer has been farming for 18 years and considers the most difficult part to be hauling his produce to the market in the city of Tarma, the place where he sells them.

Her husband is retired. She has a son and two daughters. Her son works as a welder and the daughters own a private sewing workshop.

Toktogul applied for the loan because he needs money to purchase cattle for breeding.\r\n\r\nMairmakan K. is the treasurer of the group. She is 61 and married.

In this way she earns 1500 soms ($32.65) per month. That profit made her able to purchase cattle for 18000 soms ($391.90). Mairamkan needs a loan to purchase one cow and two other farm animals. In the future she wants to expand the business and export her products to Kazakhstan.\r\n\r\nKanymbubu I. is 60. Her husband is retired.

In Ecuador she received her degree in Business Administration and practiced in the field for 25 years. When she moved to the United States, she didn\u2019t speak English very well, so she wasn\u2019t able to get a job in her field. In 1999, just months after moving to Boston, she started her own day care. \r\n\r\nStarting her own business has allowed Teresa to provide an additional income for her family. She enjoys working with the children and owning her own business. The income generated from her day care also allowed her family to purchase the house in which they are living. \r\n\r\nTeresa\u2019s greatest challenge is the summer months. Between June and August many families take their children out of the day care for vacation and summer camps. During these months, Teresa has a hard time maintaining her cash flow and paying her three employees. Another challenge has been that many parents took their children out of day care during the economic crisis. Many decided to take care of their children at home instead of paying for her services.\r\n\r\nThis is Teresa\u2019s 2nd loan with ACCION USA, with which she\u2019ll be better able to maintain her business and pay employees during the summer months. She hopes to be better prepared for low attendance next summer, so that she doesn\u2019t run into this problem again. She knows that come September she will be back up to capacity in her day care. Teresa\u2019s day care is well known in the greater Boston area and she receives many new clients through referrals.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":8775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8775,"image":{"id":579934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child
