She is a cheerful young woman who lives at home with her parents.  Edith wants to help with the household expenses because she does not want to be a burden to her family.  She makes ice cream out of her house and distributes her product to all the stores in the neighborhood, where it sells quickly because of its delicious flavor.  Most of her customers know that she make ice cream and many times will buy directly from her.  What she likes most about her job is that she can eat ice cream anytime while she is preparing it.  She has been in business for 4 years and the most difficult part is having to endure the cold when making the ice cream.  In the future, she hopes to open a large ice cream shop where she can sell her products.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Edith\u2019s sixth loan with MFP.

She is 33 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over fourteen years and earns approximately $75 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Delia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Delia is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which again will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 2nd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to continue to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is single and has one child, age eight years old. Her business is located in Juja, a busy area in Thika. Thika is the region in Kenya known for the production of pineapples. Susan sells fruits and vegetables to the local people. She says that this business is profitable and her only major challenge is slow business in some seasons.

They have 3 children, but live only with one of them: Lisbet, 4, who they are educating and raising in their own home in the town of Puente Paucartambo (in the central Peruvian jungle.)  Two years ago Norma lost her house to a flood (resulting from an overflow of water and mud from an adjacent river.)  Thanks to the humanitarian work of members of her communal bank, she was able to get through this.  She has a business selling soft drinks and beer in a small store that she set up in her house.  According to Norma, the days when her earnings are highest are Saturdays and Sundays.  But this is not Norma's only business.  Since she is a good cook, the teachers at the only school in her town hired her to prepare food for them on a daily basis, because most of them live in rented homes in another town.  Also, when Norma has free time she works with her husband on the farm, planting and harvesting coffee at one point in the year, to later sell to the wholesalers in the city of La Merced.  \r\n\r\nNorma's businesses and other activities are going very well, so in the future she is planning to convert her business selling drinks into a restaurant where she could sell the food that she knows how to prepare.  Norma belongs to the communal bank \"Luz del Futuro\" and this is her 9th loan with MFP; she expects that this small loan from you will help her to achieve these goals.

Her spouse works as a carpenter but his work is impermanent in nature.\r\n\r\nAt the end of every month, Wilma earns an approximate total of 5,680 PHP considering all these sources. She has requested a loan of 45,000 PHP from GDMPC to purchase fertilizers to enhance the growth of crops and for a high potential of return on investment.\r\n\r\nWilma is a GDMPC member, joining this year. This is her first loan transaction made in the cooperative. In the future, Wilma hopes to expand the cultivated area and raise more of these plants to gain more. She also plans to repair some portions of her house to live

P. makes and sells tortillas from her home. She has been making tortillas for four years; before that she used to weave handicraft items. She will use the proceeds of her loan to buy 300 pounds of corn which she requires every week, the firewood to fire the stove, and plastic bags in which to sell the tortillas. She\u2019s a member of the group of women called \u201cCaterina\".\r\n<p>\r\nAs a single 52-year-old woman, she has learned to be resourceful in her life. In 2005, the rains from Hurricane Stan caused her house and everything else she owned to be washed away. Her house slid down the mountainside along with everything she owned except for two of the traditional indigenous huipiles, or local blouses. She decided to sell the shirt off her back in order to start over, and sold one of her two huipiles.  Since then she has built a new house, which shares a patio with her son\u2019s house. As she tells the story of her experience with the hurricane, tears come to her eyes. She says that her health is good, but that since the hurricane she is more nervous and afraid, and that life has not been the same. Although she\u2019s recuperated somewhat from the hurricane, she still doesn\u2019t have much in the way of clothes, and often wears a t-shirt around the home, although she puts on her huipil to go to the market or into the village.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has 7 children. Two of her children and her sister help her with her growing business. \r\n<\/br><\/br>\r\nLike so many indigenous people, Sebastiana is enormously resourceful. She is a local midwife, delivering babies in her village. Some of the parents can pay and some cannot. Those who can, will pay up to 150 quetzals or about US$20 for her services.  In her medical bag are lubricant, prenatal vitamins, metal pans, and a few bandages. Currently, she is in need of gloves to wear during the delivery. When asked where she learned the art of midwifery, she replied in Cakchiquel, that although she has never gone to school and never learned to read or write, she has just always known how to do this."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":50210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

learned the craft of weaving as a small girl.  With the help of her family she mounted a small workshop in her home where she makes sweaters, ponchos, and caps.  She and her husband sell the work on Sundays and Mondays at a small stand at the Laguna Temporal market in Juliaca and with the income provide for their two small children ages 8 and 12.  The children even lend a hand with the family business on top of attending school every day.  The family is proud to report that five other people are employed in the shop, this in a country facing problems of unemployment.  The hours are long and the work sometimes tedious but the workers are upbeat and grateful for the opportunity to provide for their families.  Matilde's dream is to raise the quality of her work such that she can export her garments and make the shop a prominent employer in her city.  She is asking for a loan of $650 and promises to repay the sum within 6 months.  Matilde and her family are counting on your generosity to help this dream become a reality.  <p> <b> Translated by a Kiva volunteer.  <\/b> <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMatilde, gracias  al oficio que aprendi\u00f3 desde muy ni\u00f1a y con ayuda de su familia; construy\u00f3 en el interior de su vivienda una peque\u00f1a f\u00e1brica de artesan\u00eda d\u00f3nde confecciona chompas, ponchos, chalinas y gorras; con el  ingreso que obtiene por la venta de estos productos, que los ofrece en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo los d\u00edas domingos y lunes en un peque\u00f1o puesto del mercado \u201cLaguna Temporal\u201dde Juliaca; mantiene su hogar y cubre las necesidades de sus dos peque\u00f1os ni\u00f1os de 8 y 12 a\u00f1os quienes tambi\u00e9n ayudan con el trabajo diario de sus padres adem\u00e1s de asistir diariamente a la escuela. \r\n\r\nA trav\u00e9s de esta actividad tambi\u00e9n les otorga trabajo a 5 personas  y de esta manera contribuye a disminuir la tasa de desempleo en nuestro pa\u00eds.

She says: \u201c I am very proud of my  achievements during these six years\u201d.<p>\r\nWhen the port\u2019s construction began, Angela used to cook and then bring the dishes from her house to the construction site to her relatives who were working there.  There, the demand for her food increased and everyone working there became Angela\u2019s  customers. When the construction finished, one of the owners of the port offered Angela a restaurant where she could cook and sell her food for employers and drivers of the zone.

She has three grown children, two of whom are married.  She has participated in the TYM Fund since 2007, using her loans to invest in raising pigs.

This is 30-year-old Rehema K. from Mbeya. She is married with 2 children, 3 and 12. Rehema has been running a business selling potatoes since 2004. She buys potatoes from the farmers and sells them in town.<P>\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Rehema currently earns about 96 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 250 USD in order to purchase 50 bags of potatoes in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase her capital by increasing the number from 50 bags to 100. Rehema thanks you for your support!<P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":269767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 50 bags of potatoes in bulk for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-11T16:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Rehema H.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":55000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130727},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":55000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027515},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:17Z","rounded_local_amount":55000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613516},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":55000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010595},{"amount":41.68,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":55000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232881},{"amount":41.65,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:22Z","rounded_local_amount":54999.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664681}],"funded_date":"2009-02-11T17:17:18Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":92472,"name":"Buena Vista Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Grupo Buena Vista esta integrado por tres miembros, todos vecinos de esta cominidad, ellos se conocen muy bien. las actividades que realizan ellos son las siguientes:\nLa Sra.

As his business is the only source of income for his family, he is focused on improving his skills as a shoemaker and growing his business. The most important thing to him is being able to provide for his children's education. Now that his working capital has reached 700,000 tugrugs (~490 USD) with his years of saving he has been able to buy a car for his family needs.

She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Romeo B., who is 42 years old, works as a trisikad (pedicab) driver to earn his living. They have four children who are between the ages of 5 and 20. Esterllita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Esterllita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 22,400 PHP, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her fourth cycle loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more inventory to sell. Her goal is to continue to save up for the future expansion of  their house and to have an additional business. Esterllita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n \r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Ali who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans but have businesses that have grown too large for micro-loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":868396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy more poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kibuli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2011-09-13T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ali ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":127647.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232760768},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-19T08:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":127647.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239201796},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":127647.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244524225},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":127647.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250732899},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-18T08:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":127647.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257687333},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:34:15Z","rounded_local_amount":127647.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264132378},{"amount":118.88,"local_amount":324222,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-21T07:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":331089.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270210869},{"amount":18.62,"local_amount":50778,"processed_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":51853.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283088006},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":127647.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287459223},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":127647.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294295055},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":127647.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301347865}],"funded_date":"2011-09-16T19:17:11Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:20:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":339186,"name":"Gardelias Del Sur Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

Berbagai macam pupuk tersedia dirumahnya. Usaha ini ditekuni melihat masyarakat disekitar tempat tinggalnya sebagian besar berprofesi sebagai petani ,yang pasti membutuhkan pupuk untuk pertumbuhan padinya. Para petani cenderung membeli pupuk pada I Ketut Sudika karena keistimewaan pelayanan yang  diberikan yaitu layanan antar dan juga membayar setelah panen. Oleh sebab itu I Ketut Sudika memerlukan tambahan modal untuk usahanya ini,juga mengingat harga pupuk akhir-akhir ini meningkat drastis. Dengan adanya  tambahan modal dari Dinari ,maka I Ketut Sudika dapat tetap menjalankan usahanya dan melayani petani lebih banyak lagi. Sehingga perekonomian keluarganya dapat terbantu dan anak-anaknya dapat melanjutkan sekolah ke jenjang yang lebih tinggi. Ia sangat berterimakasih kepada Dinari atas pinjaman yang telah diberikan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":125688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

He has been a rice farmer as far back as he can remember, as his parents had him contributing on the farm as soon as he was old enough to work. He and his wife Eufemia have 5 children, two of whom (ages 17 and 6) still live with them. On his farm, Ucepio farms mainly rice, although there are some plantain trees and there is also livestock. He plans on using the money from the loan to invest in a new crop of rice, which will require seeds and fertilizer for the land. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Paypayales Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Ucepio is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Paypayales Communal Bank. All bank members are part of a rice farmers' cooperative in Santa Lucia named Dios Con Nosotros (God is with us). They will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all the guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Dios con Nosotros Cooperative are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":19428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy pesticides, fertilizer and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T19:28:57Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ucepio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-28T22:49:06Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":925,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-05-17T21:38:07Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16569},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:35:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21973},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:18:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29286},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-08-06T23:47:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":39729},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T21:06:49Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53278},{"amount":555,"local_amount":555,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:11:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":555,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65649}],"funded_date":"2007-03-14T22:49:06Z","paid_date":"2007-10-10T20:11:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10560,"name":"Rufat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rufat H. is a 23-year-old resident of Aghsu city in Azerbaijan.

She sells opposite the hospital of Koutiala to a clientele made up of women and men, for cash and credit. <P>\r\n\r\nShe expects to generate a profit of 65,000 F CFA a month that she plans to use for reimbursing the interest on her loan and for participating in daily expenses for the family, investing the remainder in other activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":269829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of potatoes for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Coumba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":27777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135831},{"amount":55.55,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033630},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620998},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019963},{"amount":55.57,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242708},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678217},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:23Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112431},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028083},{"amount":55.52,"local_amount":27777.76,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":28118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873467}],"funded_date":"2009-03-02T22:27:19Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":92504,"name":"Martha Petrona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nMartha Petrona G.

She is 45 years old. Nena is married and has two school-aged children. Nena runs a \"sari-sari\" or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste, etc., in the local community. Nena has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nena joined GDMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

Although she was able to earn additional income by working at her father\u2019s bakery, Elizabeth wanted to have her own independent business, so she decided to start her little home-based restaurant. Her business has been going quite well. \r\n\r\nElizabeth used her last loan of 1500 soles (about $500) from Manuela Ramos to purchase a special fryer for chicken. Elizabeth plans to use this loan of 2000 soles to purchase six more tables, better chairs, and food in bulk. Elizabeth\u2019s business has grown a lot. On weekends, she now has more customers than she can accommodate at the four tables she has in her restaurant. \r\n\r\nElizabeth lives with her partner and their two children, ages 13 and 7. Her partner works as a supervisor at a company that repairs broken phone lines and downed phone systems. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is glad to be working with Manuela Ramos. She was unable to get loans from other banks because they had too many requirements. Elizabeth also appreciates the educational talks given by Manuela Ramos\u2019s loan officers at every monthly meeting of her communal bank. These talks deal with business-related themes (e.g. how to promote and develop a business) as well as larger themes, such as making life goals, etc. \r\n\r\nElizabeth \"thinks big\" about her business and has many goals for the future. Eventually, she wants to buy an extra-large deep fryer for making french fries. She also wants to turn the front room of her home into a restaurant so she will have a larger and more comfortable space for her customers.\r\n\r\nIn this short video clip, Elizabeth talks about how she wants to expand and improve her business, and how she plans to take full advantage of her loans in order to do so."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":369019,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":957,"youtubeId":"lMkloCHHPfY","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur Elizabeth from  Peru","thumbnailImageId":369019},"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Higher-quality chairs, six tables, food in bulk for a restaurant business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074783},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T01:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990138},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:38:47Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835039},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726886},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:26Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118117459}],"funded_date":"2009-09-04T16:19:24Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"June Blender","image":123338}},{"id":133499,"name":"Pranita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miss Pranita T. is a single woman who lives in Thikedewol.

Noziramo is 47 years old. She and her husband have four children. Noziramo is a kindergarten teacher; however, for several years she has been selling clothing for kids. She spends the income from the business on educating her children, as she and her husband are dreaming that their children will move on into higher education. \r\n\r\nNoziramo has been provided with loans by IMON in the past and has proven to be an accurate and reliable client. Today she is requesting 10,000 TJS for purchasing new goods to sell. Noziramo and her children sincerely thank you for your generous heart.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Chu Th\u1ecb, age 47, lives in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh. To make a living, L. raises livestock, specifically cattle, to offer for sale. L. has been engaged in this business for over 18 years and earns approximately 2.800.000 VND a month from these activities. She and her husband have one school-aged child.  \r\n  \r\nIn 2008, L. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. L. has successfully repaid her most recent previous loan of 8.288.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. L. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA. L. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the borrower's business.\r\n \r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in the rural areas of Hanoi and the northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nL.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To add more income for the family, her husband also works for others in the local area, for a fee.

She sells a variety of women\u2019s skirts, blouses, and dresses.\r\n<p>\r\nIncome from Ludmila\u2019s business helped her and her husband, Victor, build their own home. Her income also helps provide for her two children \u2013 a son aged 23 and daughter, 17. Ludmila is typical of many women entrepreneurs who desire to earn extra income to provide a better living for their families.\r\n<p>\r\nLudmila has requested a loan for $800 to use to help her purchase additional inventory to sell. She typically will buy about $400 worth of clothes from her suppliers three times a month. This allows her to maintain an adequate amount of inventory on hand and she can easily update her product selection if an item is selling well or not moving quickly enough. Ludmila\u2019s business has benefited much from loans she has received in the past. We believe that this loan will continue to help her business be successful and provide much needed income for Ludmila and her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":37416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Nikopol","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.566667 34.4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2007-05-25T20:39:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ludmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-16T03:52:07Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-07-08T09:18:19Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":30246},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T09:18:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40300},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-09-08T09:19:27Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52124},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-10-08T09:20:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":64712},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-11-08T10:21:37Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":78291},{"amount":130,"local_amount":130,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T10:22:35Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":130,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93540}],"funded_date":"2007-06-02T03:52:07Z","paid_date":"2007-12-08T10:22:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14672,"name":"Yin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs Yin S.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 47 years old, married, and has four adult children. To make a living, Virgie owns and manages a fishpond. Her monthly income amounting to 1,200 Philippine pesos (PHP) comes primarily from fishpond-caught fish. \r\n\r\nIn 1999, Virgie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. Virgie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business. Virgie is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used for fishpond maintenance. This loan will be the 12th loan taken out by Virgie from PMPC. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti). She is located in San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and sugar cane industries; where the main economic activity is a free trading zone, a cement factory, and others; and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her 4 children.\r\n\r\nOlga is excited to be taking her second loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business to buy rice, flour, and other foods. Her business is a Colmado, a place where you can find all the ingredients to make your daily food.

This community is in a rural area.  \r\n<p>\r\nCipriana is extremely excited about receiving her fourth loan from Esperanza International.  She manages a fast food business from a stand in front of her house.  Her specialty is fried food.  She plans to invest her new loan in the purchase of supplies such as chicken, plantains, oil, charcoal, and a pot for cooking.  Her earnings are being saved for the future so that she can open a small restaurant in her community, otherwise known as a \u201ccomedor\u201d in the Dominican Republic.  This is one of her dreams along with having a nice house where she can rest and live securely.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group started with Esperanza because of the flexible payments and low interest rate.

S. is 45 years old, he has a high school diploma with specialization in machinery, he is a photograph by profession, he has a wife and 8 children. Jalgash has been in agriculture for the past 5 years. He plans to use this credit to purchase fertilizer and wheat seeds for sowing. Jalgash plans to leave part of his crop for personal use and the other half to sell on a market to local people. This way, the locals will have an opportunity to purchase cheaper product because it comes directly from the producer. Here, wheat is used to produce flour and then to bake bread. Flour that is sold in stores is much more expensive than flour produced by Jalgash' method. <b><p>\r\nThe client plans to bay back the loan in 10 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. \r\n<p>\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":291206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy beer, soda and water for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613676},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010755},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:05Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233041},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664832},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105544}],"funded_date":"2009-04-02T00:52:40Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":100728,"name":"Houssein","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Houssein is a 32-year-old man who lives in Tyre, southern Lebanon with his wife.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":320379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase clothes in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T19:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":503062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773303}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T18:07:38Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":113016,"name":"Maria Selene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Selene B.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarilyn is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Marilyn owns & operates a general store selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Marilyn has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\nIn 2005, Marilyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Marilyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has three children, Juan, Bertha, and Wilder, ages 16, 13, and 11, respectively.  They live together in the beautiful jungle of Cusco province, located in the town of Quimbiri, where they have their own house.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she was very young, she began working for a farmer who was then growing and harvesting cacao.  She felt that she didn\u2019t have any chance of progressing, and, only with the salary that she was receiving, she took pains to save money with the goal of having her own business.  \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, she grows and sells fruit, specifically pineapples.  Thanks to the education in farming given to her by her parents she now obtains high quality products with which potential purchasers are satisfied.  Because of this the business is giving her good economic results.\r\n<p>\r\nIn general, she works by herself, but occasionally she receives help from her children, and during the harvest season she hires people to assist her in picking and transferring her products to collection centers in her community with the goal of being able to sell them for a fair price.  Her plan for the future is to open her own shop in order to be able to have greater income\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP, and she has promised to continue making all her payments.  She is thankful to her communal group for the solidarity shown to each one of her colleagues.
