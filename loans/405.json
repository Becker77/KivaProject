She is a widow and the mother of three children who are all now adults and have moved away from Boane. She supports three grandchildren between the ages of 8 and 12, who live with her in her house. She didn't finish first grade because she had problems with her vision from a young age. It was said to be a spiritual malady. As a young girl she trained for five years as a traditional healer.\r\n\r\nShe left Gaza during the civil war all by herself because her children were already living in Maputo. She lived in their house with them, and later acquired some land and built her own house in Boane.\r\n\r\nLeonor has been a businesswoman for three years and owns a business where she works 7 to 12 hours a day. She doesn't have any employees, and works on her own to sell staple goods, mainly peanuts, which she buys in 50-kg bags for 1750 meticals and sells for 50 meticals a kilo.

Tiene 6014 habitantes. Hueyapan (San Andr\u00e9s Hueyapan) est\u00e1 a 2340 metros de altitud, el significado de Hueyapan en n\u00e1huatl significa: (Hueyi : mucha  Atlat: Agua, \"LUGAR DE MUCHA AGUA\"\n \n     Bueno en esta ocasi\u00f3n les hablare del grupo Hueyapan que llevan el nombre de su misma localidad, este grupo esta integrado por 5 personas las cuales son:  CELIA M. F., JUSTINA A. S., YOLANDA R. M., YOLANDA A. CORTES Y HERLINDA P. A. con la ultima de las acreditadas que se hace menci\u00f3n es de quien vamos hablar.\n  No tiene conocimiento de que o cual es el significado de su nombre,  la edad es de 48 a\u00f1os, curso hasta 6 a\u00f1os de primaria en la escuela que lleva por nombre actualmente \"CARLOS A. CARRILLO\" de su misma localidad hueyapan.\n\n     La Sra. Herlinda solicito un cr\u00e9dito a Fundacion Realidad, AC. Para poder comprar hilos por mayoreo de distintos colores, comprar tambi\u00e9n harina de trigo, lo anterior para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus rebozos y gabanes, que es la actividad que la sra. realiza.\nSe preguntaran ustedes que tiene que ver la harina con la elaboraci\u00f3n de los rebozos.\n\n     Bueno la manera como la sra. prepara el hilo es de la siguiente manera: primero pone a hervir agua y le vierte la harina de trigo, cuando la mezcla adquiere la consistencia de atole, lo retira de lo caliente y lo pone a enfriar, al ya estar fri\u00f3,  vierte el hilo tipo lana,  lo deja aproximadamente 30 minutos dentro, para que el hilo se ablande y no tenga una consistencia r\u00edgida para posteriormente ella poder manipularlo con mas facilidad al momento de estar  hil\u00e1ndolo,  o tejiendo en otras palabras.\n \n\n\nuna vez que lo saca de su mezcla lo exprime y  lo coloca en su tejedor y comienza a tejer el gab\u00e1n o rebozo, en este proceso de tejido se tarda un d\u00eda completo para terminarlo una vez terminado lo lava con jab\u00f3n de pasta neutro y lo pone a secar al sol con esto termina el proceso de la elaboraci\u00f3n de un gab\u00e1n hecho por manos artesanas as\u00ed sucesivamente los va elaborando cada uno. \n\n\nTambi\u00e9n se dedica al cultivo de flor de temporada por ejemplo,  ahora en este mes de Noviembre sembr\u00f3 flor de  CEMPAZUCHITL por las festividades del d\u00eda de  MUERTOS y otras F. mas de temporada.\n\n     Ella se integro al grupo de HUEYAPAN en el segundo ciclo,  actualmente es su segundo cr\u00e9dito con el grupo, ella fue invitada  por la Sra. Yolanda R. M.,  la cual es la representante del grupo,  la sra. Yolanda se dedica a la  cosecha de fruta de temporada, tiene huertos de:(MANZANA, PERA, HIGOS, AGUACATE, CAJINICUILES ESTAS SON UNA COMO BAHINAS QUE LLEVAN POR DENTRO UNA ESPECIE DE ALGODINCITOS DULCES, LES PUEDO DECIR QUE SON MUY SABROSOS, TEJOCOTE DE TEMPORADA, la SRA. CELIA M. es mam\u00e1 soltera: Es la mas relajienta del grupo, ella se dedica a la crianza de borregos y tambi\u00e9n tiene una peque\u00f1a huerta de frutas de temporada, Do\u00f1a YOLANDA A. es la integrante mas penosa, no quer\u00eda tomarse la foto con el grupo por que dice que no quieren la vean por Internet sus hijos all\u00e1 en el norte, la Sra. JUSTINA A., ella cuenta con una peque\u00f1a papeler\u00eda y venta de \u00fatiles escolares.\n\n     Bueno regresando con la Sra. Herlinda que es de  quien hablamos, ella tiene su negocio en su propia casa de hecho sus clientes llegan hasta su domicilio para comprarle los rebozos y gabanes, y por su cuenta ella va a las plazas mas cercanas a su comunidad a venderlos,  ya que aun no cuenta con un local establecido donde pudiera exhibir su producto.\n\n Esta actividad la aprendi\u00f3 a la edad de 10 a\u00f1os, su abuelita materna fue la que le ense\u00f1o a elaborarlos.\n\n Sus ingresos son buenos   les gana el 10% o 15% por cada prenda que vende pero no es su \u00fanico ingreso, aparte de ello tambi\u00e9n cuenta con una huerta de \u00e1rboles frutales, crianza y venta de borregos. Ella es una persona muy trabajadora y entusiasta.\n \n    Ella realiza su actividad en su propia casa en SAN ANDRES (HUEYAPAN), le es de mucha importancia seguir dedic\u00e1ndose a esta actividad por que sabe que son  muy pocos artesanos la que la realizan aqu\u00ed en el estado de Morelos aunado a que es herencia de su abuelita.\n\n  La parte que mas le gusta de este trabajo es porque sabe que son indispensables estas prendas en su comunidad debido a que casi todo el a\u00f1o hace mucho fri\u00f3 y que de ello ha sacado adelante a sus hijos m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os.\n\n     Ella en su actividad y en su comunidad no tiene competencia, aunque s\u00ed ha enfrentado algunos desaf\u00edos; como los costosos precios de la materia prima y el tener que viajar constantemente a la ciudad de Cuautla para adquirirlos.\n\n  Do\u00f1a Herlinda,  conforme va recibiendo sus cr\u00e9ditos lo va invirtiendo de inmediato, ella en este ciclo solicito la cantidad de $ 5,000.00 pesos, para la compra del material y como ella trabaja sola no se da abasto para  elaborar mas producto,  pues se ve apurada y necesita contratar a mas gente para producir m\u00e1s de lo que ella hace y quiere a darse a conocer con alg\u00fan buen comprador de mayoreo y hacer crecer su negocio.\n\n\nLa Sra. Herlinda es viuda desde hace un a\u00f1o, tiene 6 hijos, el hijo mayor se llama Lorenzo, el se fue a estados unidos desde hace 4 a\u00f1os, el segundo se llama Genaro el es empleado de un restaurante, el tercero se llama Alejandro el vive con do\u00f1a herlinda y le ayuda en casa y se dedica al campo, su \u00fanica hija se llama Judith es una se\u00f1orita de 18 a\u00f1os y ella trabaja como empleada en la ciudad de Cuernavaca y por ultimo los 2 peque\u00f1itos que son: Julio que va en segundo de Secundaria y Alberto en 4\u00ba. De Primaria ellos conforman su familia actualmente.\n\nElla hace menci\u00f3n sobre su parte del pueblo, me dice que es un clima muy fri\u00f3 pero la tierra en la que cultivan es muy generosa con ellos, por que todo el a\u00f1o sus \u00e1rboles frutales le dan mucha producci\u00f3n. Su casa esta construida con block de adobe de una sola planta con 3 cuartos y techo de l\u00e1mina de asbesto. De antemano su negocio le a ayudado mucho desde que su esposo falleci\u00f3 por que de ello se a mantenido y a salido adelante.\n\nSus planes de esperanza que ella tiene es que en un futuro pueda exportar sus prendas y tener un buen comprador para darse a conocer su artesan\u00eda.\n\nElla esta feliz y contenta por la oportunidad que le dieron de ser parte de Fundacion Realidad, A.C. como acreditada.\n\n    \u201cAgradecimiento por el pr\u00e9stamo que adquiri\u00f3 y por confiar en ella y agradecerles  por existir Fundacion Realidad,  gracias por  ayudar  y comprender la situaci\u00f3n de cada uno de los integrantes y de cada localidad a la que visitan y forman grupos para apoyarlo para mejorar su calidad de vida y la de nuestras familias,  muchas,  muchas gracias por ser una micro financiera de apoyo y ayuda.\u201d\n\n","en":"The community of San Andr\u00e9s Hueyapan (or Hueyapan, for short) is situated in the town of T\u00e9tela del Volc\u00e1n in the State of Morelos.  It has 6014 inhabitants.  Hueyapan is 2340 meters above sea level.  In the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nahuatl\" target=\"_blank\" >Nahuatl<\/a> language, Hueyapan means \u201cplace of abundant water\u201d (Hueyi = \u201cmany\u201d; Atlat = \u201cwater\u201d).\r\n<p>\r\nThe Hueyapan Group bears the same name as this location.  It is composed of 5 members:  Celia M. F., Justina A. Sardi\u00f1as, Yolanda R. M., Yolanda A. Cortex, and Herlinda P. A..  We will focus on Herlinda\u2019s story.\r\n<p>  \r\nNot knowing what her name means, Herlinda is 48 years old.  She completed her education through the 6th grade at the Carlos A. Carillo School in Hueyapan.  Sra. Herlinda requested a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad in order to buy yarn in different colors at wholesale.   In addition, she will purchase wheat flour to use in making shawls.  You\u2019re probably wondering what flour has to do with producing shawls.  Herlinda prepares the yarn in the following manner:\r\n<p>\r\nFirst, she combines flour and boiled water.  When the mixture becomes the consistency of porridge, she allows it to cool before adding the woolen yarn.  She lets the yarn soak in the flour mixture for 30 minutes or until it no longer has a rigid consistency.  This process makes the yarn easier to manipulate for weaving.  After the yarn is finished soaking, any excess mixture is squeezed out before the yarn is washed with neutral soap and set out to dry in the sun.  The entire process takes a full day and prepares the yarn for use in handicrafts.\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, Herlinda also grows seasonal flowers.  For example, in the month of November, the <i>cempazuchitl<\/i> (a miniature yellow marigold, an Aztec symbol of death) is planted for the \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Day_of_the_dead\" target=\"_blank\" >D\u00eda de los Muertos<\/a>\u201d celebrations.\r\n<p>\r\nHerlinda recently joined the Hueyapan Group, which is now in its second loan cycle.  She was invited by Yolanda R. M., the group leader.  Sra. Yolanda has several orchards where she grows seasonal fruits such as apples, pears, figs, avocados, <i>cajinicuiles<\/i> (a tropical fruit with flesh that looks like cotton candy), and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tejocote\" target=\"_blank\" >tejocote<\/a>.  Sra. Celia M. is a single mother and the most relaxed member of the group.  She raises sheep and also has a small fruit orchard.  Do\u00f1a Yolanda Argon is the most guarded member.  She did not want her photograph taken so that her children would not see her on the Internet.  Sra. Justina A. manages a small stationery shop where she sells school supplies.  \r\n<p>\r\nGetting back to Herlinda\u2019s story, she operates a home business in Hueyapan where her customers visit her to purchase shawls and overcoats.  She says she also travels to other venues closest to her community to sell her products since she does not have an established vending location.  Herlinda started weaving when she was 10 years old and learned this skill from her maternal grandmother.  \r\n<p>\r\nHerlinda makes a profit of 10 to 15 percent from each garment that she sells.  Apart from her agricultural activities, this is her only source of income.  She is a hardworking and enthusiastic person.  This business is very important to her because it represents an extension of her grandmother\u2019s heritage.  She faces very little competition since there are few craftspeople who work in the State of Morelos.  However, Herlinda still faces some challenges.  The cost of materials is high and she must travel constantly to the city of Cuautla to acquire them.  She is proud of the fact that her garments are indispensable in her community because of the cold that exists for most of the year.  Another benefit of the business is that it has enabled her younger children to get ahead.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Herlinda will immediately apply her loan of 5000 MXN toward the purchase of materials.  Since she works alone, she cannot generate more items on her own.  She feels rushed and needs to hire more people to produce more garments.  Herlinda hopes to come into contact with a good wholesale buyer so that she can grow her business.\r\n<p>\r\nShe became a widow last year.  Herlinda\u2019s six children are as follows:\r\n-    Lorenzo is her eldest son and left for the United States four years ago.\r\n-    Her second child Genaro is employed at a restaurant.\r\n-    Her third child Alejandro lives with her and helps around the house and on the farm.\r\n-    Her only daughter is named Judith.  She is 18 years old and works as a clerk in the city of Cuernevaca.\r\n-    Julio attends high school.\r\n-    Alberto is in fourth grade.\r\n<p>\r\nIn her part of town, the climate is very cold but the land is fertile and enables their fruit trees to be productive.  Her single floor house is made of adobe blocks.  It has three rooms and an asbestos sheet roof.  Now that her husband has passed away, her business enables her to maintain her lifestyle and move forward.  In the future, she hopes to export her garments and become connected with a good buyer that specializes in handicrafts.\r\n<p>\r\nHerlinda says she is satisfied and happy to be given the opportunity to be part of Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  She says, \u201cWe are grateful that Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad exists and for the loan that was provided to us.

She lives in her own home, in a town located in the beautiful Ayacuchana jungle.  She knows very well that she has few economic resources and that she only uses them to pay for necessities.  She also had a small plot of land, on which she cultivated cocoa, but her sales of cocoa did not generate a good income.  Now she has a plot where she cultivates cocoa and coffee in large quantities, and she also has a good number of customers among those she works with.  For this reason, she is satisfied with her work.  She has been working steadily for 39 years with good results; to achieve this, she always had the help of her children, and occasionally the help of farm workers, at harvest time.  She normally works from 8 in the morning until 6 in the evening.  Generally, she sells her products at the street market of her community.  Nevertheless, for the future, she yearns to expand her cultivated land with the goal of satisfying her customers.  This is her second loan from MFP (local lending institution), and she is committed to making timely repayments.  She is also satisfied with the work of her communal bank.  Justina will invest the loan proceeds in fertilizers and will also use part of the proceeds to pay the ongoing university expenses of her son.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeff Schell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":539292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizers and pay the university expenses of her son","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-12T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1065.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449410}],"funded_date":"2010-05-13T04:22:58Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Schell","image":null}},{"id":204410,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pictured above is Joseph K., an entrepreneur in Magburaka, a town in northern Sierra Leone.

With this loan, Ezechiel will hopefully earn more profits and these profits will allow him to keep reinvesting for better financial stability.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":556028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase of additional styles of clothes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Gisenyi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-06-18T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ezechiel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:57:07Z","rounded_local_amount":63328.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152782068},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63328.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709989},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T09:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":63328.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167037335},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":63328.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172309042},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T11:53:51Z","rounded_local_amount":63328.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177616646},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":63328.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182622845},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":63328.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188760670},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":63328.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191497602}],"funded_date":"2010-06-21T08:36:09Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:58:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":212603,"name":"Samuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samuel C. is from the village of Lugait, Misamis Oriental.

Kyrgyzstan), where she still lives now. She is 58 years old. She was the third child in a large low-income family. From an early age she had to help her mother with household duties, which is why she  completed only seven grades of primary school. At 22, she got married. Before long she had a son and later on two daughters. At that time, Damira\u2019s husband started raising sheep, but this work was not particularly profitable. However, steady income was necessary to support the growing family. And this is how, lacking formal education and practical knowledge, Damira decided to go into retail.\r\n\r\nLike many in a similar situation, Damira started by selling at the local market. With three children to feed and without a reliable source of income, working as a vendor was the only opportunity to have earnings. After much effort, her first year of entrepreneurship turned out to be successful. The starting capital amounted to 4,000 KGS, and already after the first year of work Damira was able to increase her investment. After selling food items at a market for five years, Damira was able to buy a pavilion and open a small grocery store near her home. From then on, retail became a family business. Her son got married, her older daughter too, while the younger daughter started helping with the business. In 2009 Damira obtained her first loan for 100,000 KGS from \u201cBai Tushum and Partners\u201d and built a store  on her own land plot.  Her retail work started to bring in a steady income; the number of customers kept increasing. \r\n\r\nThen the family had to face an emergency: Damira\u2019s only son was seriously injured in an automobile accident and  required expensive medical care. Around that time, her granddaughter was born, which necessitated further expenses.\r\n\r\nAt present Damira plans to receive her next loan for 100,000 KGS in order to expand her selection of goods and   buy a new refrigerator for her store.\r\n\r\nThe MFC \u201cBai Tushum and Partners,\u201d CJSC offers loans through Kiva for socially vulnerable populations. The MFC \u201cBai Tushum and Partners,\u201d CJSC is a leading microfinance organizations in Kyrgyzstan. \u201cBai Tushum and Partners\u201d is a reliable financial partner that contributes to the

Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n<p>\r\nOriginal French business description:\r\n<p>\r\n\u00ab Les membres de l\u2019\u00e9co village mara\u00eechers install\u00e9s depuis tr\u00e8s longtemps dans la vall\u00e9e (de Sin) visent \u00e0 accro\u00eetre non seulement  leur production mais continuer \u00e0 exploiter leur p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre en toute saison ; douze mois sur douze.

From childhood, he's contributed to his family's income by supporting their farming and livestock business.  However, he decided more than 3 years ago to dedicate himself entirely to raising cuyes [a hamster-like animal], for which he has a skill, on the farm--a regular-sized place--where he now has around 100 cuyes.  He grows alfalfa, the main food source for his animals, on the farm so that he can make sure they cuyes are strong and healthy.  Every 2 weeks, when they're at the right size and weight, he sells them.  That's when he can see the benefits of his efforts.  For the future, he sees himself as the owner of a large cuyes farm.  He's applying for this loan so that he can provide a balanced diet for his animals and better stock.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":220058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy stock and feed for livestock business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-15T15:51:11Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":177.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957551},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":177.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227807},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:05:23Z","rounded_local_amount":177.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423040},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":177.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116268},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:42Z","rounded_local_amount":177.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011224},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":177.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594827}],"funded_date":"2008-11-01T14:51:11Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":76572,"name":"Rahmon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rahmon K., a father of 3,  is a very responsible gentleman who repairs electrical appliance for a living at the local Isfara area.

The couple started their business with their own capital from what they were able to save from her husband's salary.\r\n<p> \r\nWhen she observed that her business was growing slowly, she realized that she needed to add to her capital in order to have more stock available for her customers. She decided to join Paglaum to borrow money for additional capital. She was very interested in other products and services that Paglaum offered.

primary caretaker of two orphans, (her late sister\u2019s children), aged 16 and 17.  An  early childhood development schoolteacher, Eunice will use this loan to improve the school by purchasing chairs, tables, charts, and porridge for feedings. Many of the children she works with are vulnerable orphans; five of the 30 children she works with are HIV positive.  It is important for her to buy porridge because, she explains, that is sometimes the only meal that these kids get during the day. Not all of the children have someone to pay their school fees, but she takes them at her school anyway.<p>\r\n\t\r\nIn the evenings Eunice sells second-hand clothing to make ends meet for her family. She will use part of the loan to buy more clothing.<p>\r\n\r\nEunice explained that she is \u201cliving positively:\u201d she is living with HIV and she is living in a positive way. She said it is ok for people to know that about her, and she also wants people to know that people living with HIV\/AIDS require good nutrition. If they are taking their ARV medicine properly, they need to be eating well, which is a challenge for many people in Kisumu.<p>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO providing Eunice\u2019s loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional microfinance institution.

She started her business with the help of her husband, who works as a mason.  They both support one another.  Marlyn previously sold only by request, but now that her clientele has grown, she does not have sufficient funds to buy clothing and cosmetics to fulfill her orders.  She invested almost all of her money into buying shoes.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan so that she can grow her business and satisfy her buyers.  She also wants to take advantage of the Christmas season to generate more sales in hopes of earning better profits.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer goal as a mother is to have her own home.  She currently lives in her mother-in-law\u2019s house, which is small and insecure because it is partially lined with sheets of zinc.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to local neighbors. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. Marilyn earns money by purchasing inventory at wholesale prices and then selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors from the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 8,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages in order to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilyn hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married and has six children.\r\n\r\nBernarda owns a grocery store.  She used to make and sell 'rosquillas' (a type of doughnut) and was in that business for 20 years.

She has been a part of this organization, using her first initial loan to invest in livestock.  After raising farm animals, she realized that the restaurant business would bring in and improve the family\u2019s income.  Since then, she has been borrowing subsequent loans in which she used to invest in a restaurant.  Presently, Ms. C. and her husband both run the family's restaurant while raising pigs and chickens at the same time.  The restaurant is known for providing good customer service and the number of people coming in to eat is growing every day.  Any leftover food from the restaurant is used to feed her livestock.  The family income has improved and since been stable from both businesses of raising farm animals and running a restaurant.  She is requesting a loan of 20.000.000d in which she plans to use to expand her restaurant and her farm.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Lynn Nguyen, Kiva

Alfara is arranging a house through Infonavit but she lacks the difference to obtain a house.  \r\n(Infonavit is a Mexican government program that provides working families with a low cost mortgage to purchase a small starter home. Some families' incomes land them just short of qualifying for the program, however.

For 20 years Juana has had a small business selling nacatamales (Nicaraguan tamales), chicharr\u00f3n (pork rind), and firewood.  When she started her business she only sold firewood, but later she acquired more capital and began investing in other products and making nacatamales.  Juana goes to sell her nacatamales in a cart pulled by two horses, which allows her to sell more.  Her short-term business goal is to increase her sales volume and attract new customers.  Thanks to a loan from Kiva partner Afodenic, Juana will be able to purchase ingredients for making nacatamales.

U. (0) is a 52-year-old woman living in the town of Faala 2.  She is married and has 3 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Masi owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising cattle for sale.  Masi has been engaged in this business for over 8 years and earns approximately 2000 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Masi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Masi has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.  Masi is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Masi plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Filomena, the bank's treasurer, is a very cheerful, determined and proactive person. David, the bank's secretary, is a person with a calm but proactive character; the other members of the bank also have similar personalities. Hilda, the president, sells clothing (jackets) within the province. Filomena sells clothing (overcoats and jackets) in the city's marketplace and also takes her products to sell within the province. David has recently started a business selling CDs at the local marketplace. This group is noteworthy in having a considerable number of male members, most of whom work as drivers in public transportation. There are also members who prepare ice cream and distribute it in large quantities. While there are competitors with similar businesses in the places where the bank members carry out their activities, the affluence of the consumers at the markets and the area's constant urban growth have allowed them to continue without negative effects. The partners are hopeful that their businesses will grow and expand, and they are requesting the current loan for that purpose. They are asking for the loan to purchase merchandise in larger quantities; in some cases to purchase new equipment to increase their production levels; and in others to buy spare parts to improve their vehicles and provide better service to their customers. This group is currently in its fifth loan cycle; accordingly, most of them already know each other and have experience working with this type of loan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":421737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing merchandise and supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-11-19T08:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3875,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Walter Hugo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filomena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melina Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Efrain","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roger Elisario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulogia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David Efrain","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":27200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5174.71},{"due_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5304.08},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5436.68},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5572.6},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5711.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":737.21},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":755.63},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":774.53},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":793.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":813.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2267.37,"local_amount":15915.47,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":15916.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678724},{"amount":3.51,"local_amount":24.62,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":24.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073214},{"amount":792.76,"local_amount":5564.64,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":5565.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073215},{"amount":811.36,"local_amount":5695.27,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":5695.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909115}],"funded_date":"2009-12-15T13:58:10Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":154592,"name":"Julie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julie B. who lives in the village of Brgy. Patic, Pulupandan Negros Occidental,is 50 years old, and married to Jersom who is a fisherman. The couple have 2 children who are 14 and 20 years old. \r\n<p>\r\nJulie works hard to help her husband improve their living situation and send their children to school so that they will have a brighter future.\r\n<p>\r\nJulie believes that the family should come first before anything else; that\u2019s why she is doing everything to improve their life by providing proper nutrition and education to her children. When she got married she decided to help her husband by selling his catch within their village and even up to the nearby towns. \r\n<p>\r\nShe was so good at selling fish that demand from her regular customers grew, prompting her to think of expanding both her husband's fishing venture as well as her own operations. So she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 so that she could purchase additional fishing gear for her husband and have access to more capital for her fish vending business.\r\n<p>\r\nBusiness did not always stay up - through the years, Julie and her husband encountered ups and downs in their business but she never lost hope and held on to her dreams for her family - the one motivating factor that made her go on in spite of the hurdles they encountered.\r\n<p>\r\nNow, her business is more stable and she earns a monthly average income of 12,000 PHP which is quite sufficient for her family's household expenses with some left over for savings.\r\n<p>\r\nJulie\u2019s previous loan of 19,500 PHP was utilized as additional capital for her fish vending and fishing business. The loan was fully repaid on time and in full without delay. For her 13th loan cycle she is borrowing the same amount to buy additional fishing nets for the fishing venture and to have working capital for her fish vending business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the picture, Julie and her husband Jersom pose with their fishing boat and some of the catch which she will sell.\r\n<em><p>\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n<\/em><p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

It is known for its rich pre-colonial culture and for its crafts renowned at the national and international level. This is where the famous straw sombreros originate.\r\n\r\nThis group of people decided to come together to from a communal bank and so to have access to loans to improve their small businesses. They have various business types, including, commerce, services, food sales, and other activities. \r\n\r\nHere we meet Mrs. Mariana del Jesus M..

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":271106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Republic. She is the coordinator for her group, Luz en Desarrollo (Developing Light), and her story is representative of the other borrowers in the group.\r\n\r\nJoaquina has a small business selling home decorations to her friends and the people in her neighborhood. With this loan, her very first with Esperanza International, she will be purchasing Christmas decorations to sell at a small markup. She also buys fabrics, bathroom decorations, and other types of interior decorations to sell to her customers. In addition to buying more inventory, Joaquina will purchase a new fan for her business so that it is more comfortable for her customers.\r\n\r\nJoaquina, her husband, and her children live in a difficult area. Los Alcarrizos can be a tough place to live with no potable running water, little access to electricity, and poor sanitation. Despite those difficulties, Joaquina is optimistic for the future.

He operates a business selling cold, purified water that he processes himself.  He also has a second business renting washing machines.  Leonardo wants to buy a trailer for his motorcycle so that he can more easily carry tanks of water and he needs to buy more tanks so that he can expand his water business.  That\u00b4s why he\u00b4s applying for a COP$1,000,000 loan.\r\nLeonardo is a bookkeeper and he worked for the state in Malambo for 6 years before he was laid off 2 years ago.  He used his severance pay to start a business selling cold meats.  He then hit on the idea of renting washing machines, a business for which he bought two machines.  A year ago, the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo matched him with a microbusiness selling purified water.  He started working for the business as a salesman.  When he saw the potential for the business, he applied to the Fundacion for a loan so that he could start his own business.  He bought a water purifier with three filters and 1 storage tank and the business now generates more than his other.  The problem is that he can\u00b4t easily carry the water so he has asked his sister to help him by riding along in a sidecar for deliveries.  Leonardo says that his life has changed since he received his first Fundacion loan because it\u00b4s allowed him to set up his own business and increased his income.  Losing his job was a challenge, but it has allowed him to develop his potential as an entrepreneur.  Since he doesn\u00b4t have a house of his own, he operates the business at his mother\u00b4s house.  Leonardo is very happy with the business because he can sell safe water to the people of Malambo where the feeling is that the water is not safe.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere

This area is known for the delicious sweets prepared by the inhabitants, which are recognized throughout the country, and for the warmth of its people, who are friendly and hard-working. \r\n\r\nIn this place, we meet Mercedes, who is 46 years old and lives with her common-law husband, with whom she has three children. All of her children are grown and study at the university. Her husband has a furniture-making workshop. \r\n\r\nShe is a very good homemaker because she helps her husband with the household expenses, by dedicating herself to raising chickens. She has a small chicken-raising operation at her home. She has done this for four years, and it has gone very well for her. She works every day. She buys the chicks from an incubator, and after three or four months, she delivers them to various stores in Rocafuerte and also sells them to commercial buyers who come to her home. Her children help her with this work. \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy more chickens, as well as medicines and feed so that they will achieve good growth. She has been with the communal bank for three loan cycles. \r\n \r\nHer dream is that her children will become successful professionals.

She is married to Gabriel, a driver, and mother of two children, one of whom is in college, while the other is in elementary school, a dream for most Filipino parents like Petronila, as she herself has been an undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nPetronila operates a firewood and charcoal retailing business. In the Philippines, many still use the old ways of cooking (on an earthen stove where firewood is used) to save money. Firewood and charcoal is way cheaper than LPG fuel, which in the current market costs as much as Php 600, and a lot of people in the provinces prefer to buy firewood, which is so cheap that it can be bought for Php 20 a bundle. Petronila also earns by selling the firewood to suppliers who buy it in bulk. More people are also switching to firewood which can be foraged or found in the trash. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of wood and charcoal to rebundle and retail to her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPetronila dreams of being able to give both her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her family and community with her as she continues to serve the Lord Almighty through her business.

For this reason, Carmelo is asking for the credit in order to demolish the front wall that is old and running the risk of falling down (at present it is not possible for him to do so because he doesn\u2019t have the proper tools nor the sufficient financial resources.)  This will be his fifth credit.  The socio-economic analysis has determined him to be well-qualified to receive this loan.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Laura Kirkvold, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carmelo tiene casa propia en la zona de Las Lomas (\u00e1rea suburbana pobre de La Paz) con su esposa (Placida Quispe, vendedora de verduras ambulante) y sus dos hijos.

The greatest challenge that has been presented to him during this time is that of economic resources, to be able to provide better maintenance to his cultivation of pineapples, since they are lacking the necessary supplies and the fruit ends up very small.  If in time he manages to implement the necessary fertilizers and supplies, he will be able to yield quality products.  This would benefit him because it would be easier to sell large pineapples at a better price, thereby increasing his earnings.  Also, he would pay off his loan on time and improve the quality of life for his family.  Luis lives with his wife in the neighborhood La Borgona, located in the municipality of Ticuantepe.  She works as a merchant to support him with the basic domestic expenses, such as water and electricity.  They have four older children, all of whom live with them and work with Luis in agriculture.

Although he has never married and has no children of his own, he is very affectionate with children.  His house is very far from the city but it is a very appropriate location for the work he does.  He is a watchman at a mine; he works from 6pm until 7am.  During his time off he likes to engage in commercial activities.  He used to sell charcoal and fish but this turned out to be not very profitable.  One day, while he was walking in the countryside, an old woman gave him a piglet.  He thought the piglet would require a lot of his time so he wasn't too anxious to accept it.  Finally, however, he agreed to raise it.  When the piglet reached the proper weight, he used its meat to prepare \"chicarrones\" (pot-fried pork) and he sold a few portions.  He never imagined that he would become a successful cook and chicarron salesman.  He now raises his own pigs.  Although V\u00edctor was never able to find the old woman who gave him his first pig again, he lives grateful to her for having started him off on his current economic activity.  This is his second loan with MFP and he is very happy with the results of his past investment and for the level of responsibility of his fellow group members.  The funds requested will be used to build a corral that will be adequate to raise his 7 pigs since his goal is to increase the number of animals so that he can have a large chicarron restaurant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":476292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To build a corral for his pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-25T18:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":142.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960266},{"amount":49.87,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":142.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993110},{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":142.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717896},{"amount":49.87,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":142.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751571},{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":142.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934039},{"amount":50.62,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":144.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672792}],"funded_date":"2010-01-26T00:06:40Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":175358,"name":"Omolara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Omolara is a member of the Yoruba tribe and lives with her family in Nigeria.

He sells these items as a traveling salesman in the nearby areas like San Miguel, Agua Blanca, and Chilete (towns that belong to the region of Cajamarca).

As an added value, Freddy, doctors and health professionals offer medical advice at the store to prevent self-medication, as a way to focus his social responsibility with his customers; he guides them with everything related to medical prescriptions, managing dietary nutrition, etc.\r\n\r\nHis business idea was born when he was in Caracas, capital of Venezuela, and he was working as a consultant in a project for drugstore owners; he learned about the liquidity and profitability of this business. He was also close to many experiences of how owners managed their businesses and this finally prompted him to make the decision to start his own business. For this reason, when he came to Colombia and his Mom insisted that he setup a drugstore, he did not hesitate.

She has had her fast food business for some years now.  Her daughter helps her sell the food until 10:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nTo have the business she had to invest her savings in supplies for food.  Little by little, and with effort, her food business was growing.  Now she has a fast food stand, and she sells rice with chicken and meat.  \r\n\r\nTo give her customers better service she wants to make adaptations to her food stand.  She will use the loan to buy cane, cement, and supplies.\r\n\r\nOne of her goals is to have her own restaurant and to have sports fields to rent.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny

This activity has been beneficial to her because most of the people in her locality make tortillas at home every day to eat.  Therefore, the service Ignacia provides is basic which has provided her with guaranteed daily income.  This has allowed her to improve her locale because at the beginning it was made from cardboard sheets, as was her house, and now it is stone.\r\n\r\nShe uses the loan to provide maintenance and repair for the mill and to buy parts, like gears and bearings, to replace deteriorated ones.  These parts need to be changed periodically due to use and this isn\u2019t counting some breakdowns caused by the machine\u2019s age since it has been in operation for 60 years.\r\n\r\nShe has 6 children (3 boys: Gustavo, 23, Daniel, 19 and Jos\u00e9 Manuel, 17, and Antonia, 28, Juana, 26 and Guadalupe, 21).\r\n\r\nShe has been in this line of work for 26 years.

She is a resident of Malabor, Tibiao Antique, Philippines. Her husband died five years ago and she has taken on the role of being both mother and father to her children. Her eldest child is 27 years old and her youngest is nine. Because of poverty, two of her children have only completed high school, but she has never lost hope because she has still one child who is studying.\r\n\r\nAfter her husband died, Clarita focused much of her time on fish vending to move on and to provide for the needs of her family. She doubled up her work efforts because she did not want her children to go hungry or get sick. Clarita hopes that at least one of her children will finish college because she knows that it is very difficult to find work without a good education.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Clarita had the opportunity to join ASHI when ASHI ANB opened an expansion program. Clarita\u2019s dreams were the basic requirements of membership. Her first loan was for 5,000 PHP which she used to expand her fish selling business. \r\n\r\nClarita is requesting a second loan of 10,000 PHP to use as additional capital for her business. The income that she will gain will be a great help to provide for her family and support her child who is still studying. Clarita also dreams that her business will improve with the help of ASHI and Kiva, and she hopes to expand her fish selling business to the wholesale level if she has enough capital.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nVilla is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Villa prepares and sells cooked food for daily meals. Villa has been engaged in her business for more than a year and earns approximately 2500 PHP each month.\r\n\r\nVilla joined ASKI this year to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Villa is requesting her first loan, for 6000 PHP, to be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. She plans to use the additional revenue generated as a result of the loan to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds.

He did not have the opportunity for an education, and from childhood he helped his parents in agricultural work. He is married to Maria, who is 54 years old, and they have no children. They live in Santo Domingo canton in the province of Santo Domingo of the Ts\u00e1chilas. Santo Domingo connects the mountain region with the coastal region of Ecuador. It is a city that has become a commercial axis with various growth sectors, and as proof can be taken a number of entrepreneurial families who began some years ago with little businesses and now are microentrepreneurs who contribute to the generation of employment. Studies reveal that the majority of all businesses began empirically and were welcomed by the passage of tourists, businesspeople, and travelers who move from one region to another, and in addition, the city has the third largest population in the country. \r\n\r\nRoberto lives in the Luz de America parish of this canton, a sector that is considered the port of entry to the province. Because of the richness of its land, it has been the origin of various food-producing businesses, in addition to being an area with great production of papayas, an exotic fruit exported from here. It is for this reason that the great majority of the inhabitants of this parish work in agriculture, which has been the motivation for various entrepreneurs of this zone to strengthen this activity with their work, experience, and effort.\r\n\r\nIn a number of parts of the city are lands producing all types of crops. On one of these is Roberto, who has already worked in agriculture for 40 years. He works all day, planting, harvesting, fumigating, and doing all the work that obtaining a final product of good quality demands. With the help of his wife, he achieves good results in spite of the losses of crops that occur because of unexpected weather changes and natural phenomena that arrive in the area at certain times of the year. The greatest obstacle that he has always had is the lack of economic resources to invest in his business, but now he has found Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, which, through the Kiva loans, has offered him the convenience of accessing a loan that he will use to buy seeds and supplies for planting and caring for his crops.
