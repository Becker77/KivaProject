is a group loan to be shared by five entrepreneurs from the Diama association in the village of Oussouye in southern Senegal.

Our purpose is to combat migration from rural areas and create employment for the young members of our group.  Our business activities include the purchase and retail sale of cosmetic products such as lotion, perfume, and other beauty products.  These products will be purchased from wholesalers in Dakar, then sold in Oussouye in order to serve the rest of the county.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French: <p>\r\n\u00ab Contexte du Projet: Le groupement  Diama est un groupement de jeune de  Escale \u00e0 Oussouye  qui travail depuis tr\u00e8s longtemps dans le cadre de d\u00e9veloppement et cr\u00e9ant une centrale d\u2019achat de vente de produits cosm\u00e9tique et divers. <p>\r\nObjectifs du Pr\u00eat : Lutter contre l\u2019exode rural et cr\u00e9er de l\u2019emploi pour les jeunes membres du groupement. <p>\r\nActivit\u00e9s : Achat et vente de produits Cosm\u00e9tique tel que : lait de toilette, parfum, et autres mat\u00e9riel de beaut\u00e9.\r\nCes produits seront achet\u00e9s \u00e0 Dakar chez les commer\u00e7ants grossistes puis vendus \u00e0 Oussouye afin de pouvoir servir le reste du d\u00e9partement. \u00bb <p>\r\n\r\nBackground <p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.

She lives in the Kawangware area in Nairobi. Besides her immediate family, she takes care of her 22-year-old sister-in-law, whose mother died. Because Jacqueline\u2019s husband is the eldest in his family, it is therefore his responsibility to take care of his sister, till she finds a job in order to support herself.\r\n<p>\r\nEver since she can remember, Jacqueline had been interested in becoming a tailor. To accomplish this, she joined a training class at Redeemed Gospel Church at Huruma in Nairobi for classes and practical training, which lasted for two years. After training, she started her business in 1996 with about US $147, which she borrowed from her sister. She has since paid that off. She started by making petticoats, which she sold from house to house for a period of six months. The business picked up very well, and with this income she built a stall of her own in Kayole, where she could carry out her business more effectively. She later expanded her business and started making clothes and curtains. And she started offering training; at the moment she has three trainees. Jacqueline was doing well, but unfortunately, her stall was broken into and two of her sewing machines were stolen. Because of this, she had to rent two machines for four months, at about $7 per machine per month. This eventually became too much of a burden and made her business shrink, and she even lost customers.

She is a 54-year-old widow with a child who helps her on the plantation. Although she and her child try to work hard, they still cannot support themselves well. Thus, Mrs. Tang S. decided to ask for a loan to buy two piglets to start a breeding business and she hopes to improve her living conditions after she sells the pigs. <p>\r\nAll members in this group have end-of-term loans, so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The couple share in supporting their family. Nestor left school at the secondary level, then learned barbering. He has been working at this business for 10 years; the income from it allows him to support his family only with great difficulty.  \r\n\r\nNestor is asking for a loan, for the first time, from ALID\u00e9, so as to acquire certain necessary materials that will allow his barber shop to function better so that he can satisfy his clientele. Later on, Nestor would like to open other barber shops so as to grow his clientele. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":546557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber Shop","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"purchase of clippers and adjustable chairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"SEME-PODJI","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.383333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-05-27T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Boya  Nestor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835725},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159576122},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954636},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056293},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347828},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482864},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617679},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191361076},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779776},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401582},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":26687.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206089313}],"funded_date":"2010-05-30T17:13:54Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:03:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":208198,"name":"Sophea's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group loan consists of four people who live in Preaek Anhchanh village in Kandal province.

She is married and has one child, aged 3.  In 2000, she established her vegetable farming business.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

There he has a cabinet maker's shop, an activity that he learned while working in a business with these same characteristics. He worked with the previous business for 10 years, and has been independent for five years, having purchased his own tools and machines to start his own micro business, which is how he and his family live now.  His future goal is to have an industrial machine and to work particularly on doors in order to distribute them weekly via vendors.  In his shop he works on many different pieces, including beds, dining room tables, shelves etc.  In Gabriel's shop, his clients order products and give him a percentage of the price of the product so that he can get started on his business.  Currently his capital is not sufficient to be able to grow the business and to respond to the needs of his clientele in the periods of highest sales for his products.  For that reason he approached Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, a Kiva field partner, in order to buy raw materials and agricultural products with his first Kiva loan.  This is also the first financing that he has done with this organization.  With this investment he will succeed in making new designs and exhibiting them in his shop.

Her shop is located at the busy intersection of two major streets in San Ignacio. This business is her livelihood and has helped her sustain her family. Maria, now 50 years old, is married with two daughters, one of whom helps her in her shop and the other is now married and lives with her husband.<p>Like many women in Paraguay, Maria worked in Argentina for a number of years. The economic situation is good enough in Argentina to allow these women to work and save money, rather than living day to day. It is in this way that Maria was able to save the money to open her store by renting some space. She is also grateful to her husband who helped maintain the family during this time. Today she lives in her own house in a preferred neighborhood in San Ignacio, Paraguay.<p>With the credit she has requested, Maria will repair a small-refrigerated cart, which will be of much use

She saved some money and managed to buy back these shops. Eventually, she sold them to buy an empty building, and made it into a pub. Now she earns twenty five dollars monthly.

It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History <p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has 2,255 inhabitants.  San Juan Ahuehu\u00e9yo is at 1,160 meters in altitude.  It has an indigenous population of 262.  The indigenous languages are Nahuatl and Mixteco.  The population is economically active.  The meaning of \u201cAhuehu\u00e9yo\u201d comes from tree and its name in N\u00e1huatl is \u201cAhuehuete\u201d.  That is the name of the group that we will talk about.\r\n\r\nThe four members are Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3 Gonz\u00e1lez Garc\u00eda, Marina de Jes\u00fas S. S., Gina Rebeca L. G., and Emilia Hern\u00e1ndez Carre\u00f1o.  The last one is who we will discuss.\r\n\r\nEmilia Hern\u00e1ndez Carre\u00f1o\u2019s name does not have any significance.  She is 33, and she went to school until the third year of high school.  The school\u2019s name is Licendiado Benito Juarez, and it is in the same area.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy raw materials like bulk natural soy and bags of wheat by the kilo.  She makes natural products like wheat milanesa, soy chicharron, soy hamburgers, soy meatballs, and others.  She makes them herself without any chemicals.  Everything is natural.\r\n\r\nHer business does not yet have its own name.  She has been making and selling natural products for 15 years.  She learned together with her husband when they were working in a well-known restaurant in the center of Cuautla.  There they learned the job and the product.  Before starting the production of soy food they sold natural yogurt, fruit, and granola.  It did not go very well for them because they did not have the money to continue producing the dairy products.  But, upon learning to make the products like milanesa and sausages, etc. they saw that this was profitable.  They did not invest much, and they got more earnings.\r\n\r\nHer business is in her house, where she makes her product.  It is important to them to not add preservatives; everything they use is natural.\r\n\r\nShe has a great satisfaction from what she does and that her husband helps her in the business.  Her customers are her neighbors, and they are the best promotion she has where she lives.  She also sells her products in the area markets.  She has two very good buyers who buy wholesale.  She has the desire that someone will get to know them so that they can export their products to other states and they get to know the products.\r\n\r\nThe challenge in her business is the rise in prices of the raw material she uses.  This greatly affects her at vacation time because things don\u2019t sell the same then.\r\n\r\nEmilia has been married to Mariano V\u00e1squez Acevedo for 18 years.  They have four children.  The first is Domingo Vazquez H..  He is the oldest sibling, is 17, and he works independently.  The second is Emilio Vazquez H..  He is in the first year of high school with his brother, Mariano Vazquez H..  They are twins, and go to the same high school.  The little one is Gema Vazquez H..  She is 7, and she is in the second grade.\r\n\r\nEmilia describes her area as a place where there is lots of vegetation, fields, and corn, onion, sugar cane, and bean crops.  Upon entering her community we can observe all of this nature.\r\n\r\nHer house is small; there are three rooms.  They need to finish the walls and the floor, but it has a small garden, which is very pretty.  In the future she wants to give her three small children a good education and a better quality of life.  She was doubtful about the loan, and then it was granted.  She did not believe it was true.\r\n\r\nShe wants to use her own words to say the following, \u201cI am very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad A.C. institution because without their help we would not be able to make this small advance in our business.  It is also very good that they support women and single mothers because they are the ones who fight more to improve their quality of life.  They do not have anyone to join in this battle shoulder to shoulder.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe joined the group by the invitation of Marina de Jes\u00fas S. S\u00e1nchez.  She is currently the group\u2019s representative, and she is the one who puts pizzazz in the group.  They are very united.  She is followed by Gina Rebeca L\u00f3pez Gatita.  She sells sweets in her area.  Then there is Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez who sells Mexican snacks (sandwiches) in the primary school cooperative, which is close to her community.  Finally, there is Emilia, who we have discussed.  They form the \u201cAhuehuete\u201d Communal Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":460615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Buy soy and wheat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-01-05T23:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marina De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gina Rebeca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":440.63,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5674.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080366},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3783.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123916686},{"amount":367.19,"local_amount":4687.5,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4729.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128952418},{"amount":73.43,"local_amount":937.5,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":945.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136681245}],"funded_date":"2010-01-06T04:20:35Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:58:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":170782,"name":"Tita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tita A. is from the village of Bucana-Sicayab.

Dentro de unos d\u00edas espera cosechar sus productos y venderlos a buen precio en el mercado y as\u00ed poco a poco reunir dinero para instalar una tienda de abarrotes en su barrio.\n\nEste es el noveno pr\u00e9stamo de Jaime con MFP, sabe que tiene que pagar todas sus cuotas puntualmente si no desea causarle problemas a su banco comunal, en el cual es un socio muy responsable y puntual. Con los dos mil nuevos soles solicitados comprar\u00e1 nuevas semillas de alverja y papa, tambi\u00e9n adquirir\u00e1 abono e insecticidas.","en":"Jaime is 39 years old. He has always worked very hard to get his family ahead. He lives in his own home with his wife Lourdes, 39, and his minor children, who are the reason for all his work. \r\n\r\nPotato, corn and pea crops are what he does for a living. Every morning he works his land so it will be more fertile and productive. While he does this activity, his wife raises cows. They provide milk for the family and to sell. They know that they have to work in everything they can, since their children's educations require a lot of expenses. \r\n\r\nWhat Jaime likes the most about his work is protecting his crops from the pests that can plague them. He has been doing this for 23 years and he considers that the hardest part is transporting the products to market of the city of Tarma, where he sells his crops. Within a few days he hopes to harvest his products and sell them at a good price at market and thus little by little get the money together to open a grocery store in his neighborhood.  \r\n\r\nThis is the ninth loan that Jaime has had with MFP. He knows that he has to make all of his payments on time if he doesn't want to cause his communal bank problems. With the two thousand nuevos soles he is asking for he will buy new pea and potato seed, and he will also acquire fertilizer and insecticides.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":503635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase seed, fertilizer and insecticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-10T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2051.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886862}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T07:01:27Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":187730,"name":"Kinta","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Kinta Y. est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 44 ans, elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 6ans.

is a married woman who lives in Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, a sugarcane plantation, and a rice field. \r\n\r\nHer husband Ramelo, who is 40 years old, works as a jeepney driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 3 to 15 years old; two of them are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nSusan joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Susan has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of 15,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 9,500 PHP, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing 23,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy stock for the store and fertilizer for the rice and sugarcane. She wants to continue to save up for future education costs and family needs. \r\n\r\nSusan is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a grocery store, a livestock business and buying and selling gasoline. Her husband Roel, who is 48 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 10 and 16 years old. Antonieta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Antonieta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her third loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy more stock for the store so that she can continue to save up for future improvement in her business. Antonieta is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The official name of this borrowing group is \u0110\u00f4ng Th\u00e1i 1 - nh\u00f3m 11 (11).\r\n\r\nHu\u1ec7 is married and has two adult-aged children. To making a living, Hu\u1ec7 owns and operates a business making food items such as beef noodle soup and bun cha, and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community.  Hu\u1ec7 has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Hu\u1ec7 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Hu\u1ec7 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 7.392.000 VND, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make food items for sale. The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA. Hu\u1ec7 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nHu\u1ec7  l\u00e0 53 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

After the harvest, she sells her crop in the Alto Palomar Cooperative. But what generates her daily but less profitable earnings are her banana and avocado crops, which she markets every 15 days in Punte Paucartambo, a marketing annex between the cities of Villa Rica and Oxapampa.

He is a motorcycle mechanic and sells spares for bicycles in Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9. Having not completed primary school for lack of support, he had to learn mechanics for motorcycles and bicycles in his native village. This career which he has been practicing for ten years is not sufficient really to completely meet the family needs due to the insufficiency of his working capital. So he requested and got an initial credit of $500 which he has repaid without incident to strengthen his business of selling spares. With his sense of good management, Mr. Gadagodo S. deserves to be supported financially to increase his businesses. Thus, he is requesting a credit of $1,200 to buy spares in Nigeria and to resell them in Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9.

Thi Nhung is 55 years old. She has 4 children and 3 are grown. Before joining TYM fund, her family's economic situation was quite difficult. Her husband died at an early age while the children were still young. In 2004, she joined the fund to borrow money to invest in a grocery store. Presently, the store is her family's main source of income. She also has additional monthly help from her grown children who also work, so the family's economic situation is getting more stable by the day. For the next loan, she wishes to borrow 600 USD to buy additional merchandise as requested by the customers for the upcoming Tet Holiday. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is 28 years old. Jerlyn is married and has two young children. To make a living, Jerlyn operates a \"sari-sari\" (variety) retail store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Jerlyn has been engaged in her business for more than a year and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jerlyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jerlyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jerlyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Jerlyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Meldred is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Meldred from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

In the future he would like to have a playground in his patio area.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":571711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-07-23T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesar Augusto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":67.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":74.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":76.73},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":77.87},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":80.2},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":81.53},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":83.42},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":86.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":87.36},{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":89.6},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":91.46},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":103.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.37},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.73},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.87},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.2},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.53},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.36},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.6},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.46},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67.56,"local_amount":67.56,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":67.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845945},{"amount":74.44,"local_amount":74.44,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":74.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172112217},{"amount":76.66,"local_amount":76.66,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":76.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405627},{"amount":77.87,"local_amount":77.87,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":77.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182544097},{"amount":80.2,"local_amount":80.2,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":80.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680851},{"amount":164.95,"local_amount":164.95,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:23:19Z","rounded_local_amount":164.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797175},{"amount":86.38,"local_amount":86.38,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:22:30Z","rounded_local_amount":86.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201239348},{"amount":87.36,"local_amount":87.36,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-18T07:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":87.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206105798},{"amount":89.6,"local_amount":89.6,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-20T07:52:48Z","rounded_local_amount":89.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211862567},{"amount":91.46,"local_amount":91.46,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:40:46Z","rounded_local_amount":91.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216459069},{"amount":103.52,"local_amount":103.52,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-21T07:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":103.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221622942}],"funded_date":"2010-07-31T16:39:26Z","paid_date":"2011-08-21T07:38:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Her husband is a rickshaw driver and provides transport services to passengers and drops them at their designated places. His rickshaw is creating a problem nowadays which is affecting his work and income. He will utilize the loan in repairing it so, he can continue his work and provide his services to the passengers.\r\n \r\nNaseem is a mid-wife. She adopted this profession a few years ago to financially assist her husband. In Pakistan midwifery is a profitable profession because many poor people can\u2019t afford hospital fees and they prefer to approach midwives.  In her spare time she also does embroidery work for her neighboring clients to earn extra income for her family. \r\n\r\nShe has given birth to 5 daughters who are enrolled in school and getting their education. She is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 2nd loan application. In the previous loan year, she has  built up a good credit history and never missed any meeting.  \r\n\r\nShe comes from Arifwala, a small city of Punjab, Pakistan, known for its agriculture industry. She lives there in an area called Muhallah Eid Gah which is a small residential area of the city.  \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady with a book (called Asasah Passbook) is

is a married woman who lives in Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 3 businesses: a sari-sari (general) store, a sugarcane plantation and a tricycle transport business. Her husband, Jeremiah P., 47 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have four children, aged 12 to 20 years old. \r\n\r\n<p>Lucia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and her own efforts, Lucia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 9,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000,  raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for the general store in order to save up for the business' future expansion. Lucia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

That is why she decided to sell hand bags and clothing for women and men and obtain some extra money. \r\n\r\nIrene sells her products to her friends and neighbors, but she also goes door to door throughout her community, selling her handbags and women's and men's clothing and says that it has been going well, thank God, and that she has earned a little income.\r\n\r\nIrene needs this loan to buy hand bags, women's and men\u2019s underwear, skirts, blouses, shirts, pants and dresses to later sell. She hopes that with this investment her business will grow, thereby providing a better quality of life for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":868888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to sell clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-09-16T14:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":1312.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1366.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807718},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:52Z","rounded_local_amount":780.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618817},{"amount":27.94,"local_amount":335.26,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":349.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573058},{"amount":50.18,"local_amount":602.24,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":626.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785312}],"funded_date":"2011-09-16T15:36:52Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":339378,"name":"Samuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samuel has been practicing livestock farming for the last 10 years in Limuru town.

He lives in a common-law marriage with Jessica who helps him attending the family business. They live in their own house with their four-year-old son. Heisen's activity consists in renting video games. He has installed four play stations at home, where he has a room with tables and chairs for the convenience of his customers. The booths are rented to neighbors and other people requesting his services. He told us that he learned this activity five years ago from his brothers who are also active in this business. Eventually he managed to save some money and used it as start capital for his own business, and now he and his partner attend it together.

They have a son and a daughter who are both in high school. They have contracted for this farm since January 2007 and have invested a lot of money in it. Every day she and her husband look after 800 ducks including egg-laying ducks and ducks for food, 25 pigs and a fish pond and a rice field of one hectare. However, she is still full of energy and plans. So she wants to borrow $1,200.00 to build a biogas plant ($430.00) to keep the environment clean and make the most of livestock manure. She will also use the loan to buy 25 breeding pigs and 800 chickens and ducks. As for payment, she is very confident and proud because she gets $6.5 per day from selling eggs, not to mention regular incomes from other livestocks. She says she doesn't fear hardship, she just dreams of having enough money to send her children to university."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":50822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"She

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":270404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy soda, juice, beer and biscuits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-16T05:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130757},{"amount":32.49,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027545},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613546},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010625},{"amount":32.51,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232911},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664706},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105432},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022577},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867826},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:33Z","rounded_local_amount":42691.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757027}],"funded_date":"2009-02-16T06:04:56Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":92680,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \n\nJulia solo cuenta con el apoyo de los prestamos de EDAPROSPO desde hace un a\u00f1o; sin embargo, su negocio tiene ya veinte a\u00f1os en funcionamiento.

poor region located in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. She is applying for a loan of 300,000 colons, and this will be her first loan with Fundacion Mujer.<P>\r\n\r\nAt first glance, one would not be able to tell, but Jacqueline has a chronic illness called fibromyalgia, a virus affecting her muscular abilities. She has been sick for roughly 10 years. In order to fight the pain brought on by her illness, she takes up to 15 pills every day. The pills help; but the best therapy, she says, is her work. By staying busy with her candle-making, among other things, she can avoid taking so many pills, which leave her very tired and feeling weak. Jacqueline, or Jacky as it reads on her business cards, finds candle-making to be therapeutic as well as a means to generate income which helps pay household expenses and put her children through school. Her faith and her business are what get her out of bed every day and keep her motivated to take on life\u2019s challenges with an optimistic outlook.<P>\r\n\r\nJacky has eleven years' experience in the sales business; candle-making she has started relatively recently and has found it to be both profitable and rewarding. Jacky could not afford to take any formal candle-making classes, so she taught herself through trial and error. She can sell her candles for up to 8500 colons each. Her candles sell fast and she earns much more than she did working at the local mall.  In a 12 hour day, she used to earn 7,000 colons working in a shop. Selling her candles, she can earn up to 350,000 colones per month. It takes her 2 days to make 8 candles.<P>\r\n\r\nThis loan would be used to purchase raw materials and molds necessary for the creation of her beautiful candles. Recently, Jacky has received an abundance of orders for a specific type of candle she makes, with butterfly decorations. In order to respond to this surge in demand, she would like to purchase 2 more molds necessary to the creation of these candles. The molds cost 11,000 colons each. At the moment she has many different molds which she uses to create a variety of colorful, scented candles. This loan will help Jacqueline to take advantage of opportunities for increase sales associated with the Christmas season. <P>\r\n\r\nUnder the business name \u00a8Creaciones Jacky,\u00a8 Jacky and her son, Alonso, have put together a homemade catalog with pictures of the candles Jacky has created. When he isn\u2019t studying chemistry at the National University, Alonso helps his mother sell her products to shops in the nearby mall.<P>\r\n\r\nJacky is a true entrepreneur. Whether she is making candles, painting ceramics, promoting her products or taking care of the family, she is always doing something--and that\u00b4s the way she likes

The business is located on one of the main streets of the town, right in front of her house. Because of the financial difficulties that the family were facing--her husband\u2019s income didn\u2019t cover the family\u2019s expenses--Rosa decided to take advantage of the excellent location of the house and start a new business. Now she has many customers although sales are low. For this reason she would like a loan to buy eggs, candy, more fruit, plastic bags in which to put the fruit, and other items that she does not sell at the moment.

This is the physical location where  Luis C. O., 28, lives with his wife and 4-year-old son, and where he works buying and selling precious metals such as gold and silver.  He has been here for the last three years when he left his job as an employee in a jewelry store and went out on his own as a means of becoming self-supporting.\r\n\r\nHis business is based on buying and selling gold and silver by the gram bought from scrap merchants and suppliers, and that's how he makes his profit.  As always he needs available cash to be able to take advantage of the opportunities of the price fluctuations in the market of these metals.  He is requesting a loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation which he will use to buy gold and silver from the recyclers and scrap merchants who are his best suppliers.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to continue his university studies but first he must succeed in becoming financially solvent with his jewelry business.  His most important goal is to spend time with his family but each day that is becoming more difficult.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva

She is 40 years old, married, and has two children. Gulshan puts a lot of enthusiasm into the development of her farming efforts and cattle breeding because she is aware that they can help her children.  \r\n\r\nShe sells fattened cattle to the local butchers and fruits to the local bazaar traders. Her monthly income is about $250-$315 and it is not enough to cover basic family needs.

She lives in her own house together with her husband Ernesto, age 49, and their 4 beloved children, for whom they would like to provide a better future. Lidia's farmlands are the best, and she keeps them well cared-for. Every day she gets up to make breakfast for her children who go to school. Later, she and her husband get ready to go out to the fields to cultivate their coffee, cacao, palillo [perfume guava] and barbasco plants, products which she later takes to sell in the wholesale centers located in the cities of San Francisco and Kimbiri. What she likes most about her work is the freedom she has to wander through the green fields of her village. She has been doing this work for 22 years, and she thinks the most difficult part is protecting her crops from the pests which attack the buds of the plants. With time, she would like to buy more land to increase her production.

E. is 19 years old, is a native of Bluefields, Nicaragua, and is single.  For a year has been making a living selling perfumes and other beauty products from the Selsa company.  This business functions as follows:  based on orders, a Selsa company representative sends beauty products to young G. on credit and she is responsible to sell these and to pay for the products, for which they pay her a commission of 30% on the sales.  In this way young Norma G. takes home this pay to help with the expenses of the house of her mother, who is a single parent.  Nonetheless her main problem is that her clients who are mainly women, buy these products on payment terms (in two and three twice-monthly or monthly payments), thus although G. is selling a lot of products, her commission is small. It should be mentioned that young G. only sells these products since the orders that she makes out are for products ordered in advance and she only needs to deliver them once they are sent to her.  It is for this that she needs a loan in order to buy these products which will permit her to make a profit of 60% on each item. She wants to buy:  4 bottles of Ferratt perfume at $10 each, 4 bottles of Mistery perfume at $50 each, 4 bottles of Esse perfume at $15 each, 4 bottles of papaya shampoo at $10 each, 6 containers of hair gel at $13 each, 4 dandruff shampoo at $11 each, 6 ladies\u2019 deodorants at $4 each, and 3 acne lotions at $13 each.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Diane Lister, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa joven Norma G.

Este negocio funciona de la siguientes manera, una representante de la empresa Selsa le envia en base a solicitud productos de belleza a la joven G. al credito y esta se encarga de venderlo y cobrar el producto por lo cual le pagan una comision del 30 % sobre las ventas. De esta manera la joven Norma G. lleva este pago a su casa para ayudar en los gastos de la casa a su mama que es madre soltera. Sin embargo su problema  principale es que sus clientes que son mas  del genero femenino le compran estos productos con facilidades de pago (en dos y tres cuotas de pago quincenal y mensual), por lo que aun que vende bastantes productos, su comision es poca. Cabe mencionar que la joven G. vende estos productos ya que los pedidos que realiza son por encargos y solamente tiene que entregarlos una vez que se los envian. Es por esto que requiere de un financiamiento para poder comprar estos productos de los cuales les permite obtener una ganancia hasta del 60% por cada uno.

It is about a 45 minute drive from Sunyani, the regional capital. Ruth sells crates of eggs to make some income to support her family.

With their income from their business activities, they can provide the basic needs for their family.

For this, she is requesting to avail a loan amounting to PHP 5,000 for both the maintenance of their motorcycle transport and her livestock raising business. She also wants to start a rice vending business to earn extra income. However, Fely said that she cannot do all of these at the same time considering the availability of funds. Thus, she is praying that her loan will be approved to be able to make her business successful. She believes that all her business plans, if pursued, will be of big help to her family. She hopes to become successful in the business by being patient and by exerting more efforts in doing her work. According to her, she will only believe that she has already achieved her goals in life when she sees her children finish their studies in college and find a better job.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":321211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":350814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of cereals in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-07-11T01:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gwantwa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:38Z","rounded_local_amount":71012.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665064},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:49Z","rounded_local_amount":71012.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105776},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":71012.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022886},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:40Z","rounded_local_amount":71012.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868127},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":71012.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757323},{"amount":54.15,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":71012.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146417}],"funded_date":"2009-07-11T04:28:50Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":125464,"name":"Regina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Regina is a member of the Upendo North borrower group in Kinyanambo.

The official name of this borrowing group is \"Taguntungan Group.\"\r\n\r\nLerma is married and has 6 school-aged children. To make a living, Lerma raises and sells pigs.

Lerma is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be Lerma's first loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. It is also a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At night she works in a small restaurant called Las Dos Torres where she prepares a variety of snacks.\r\n\r\nJulia is asking for a Lps. 7000 loan to buy a larger amount of clothes, especially those in season so that she can attract more customer attention and increase sales.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to own her own home and stop paying rent and to have a small store that will allow her to continue to earn income because she also has a grandson under her care and needs money to support her household.\r\n\r\nHer fellow group members are Lilian and Luisa.  Lilian sells clothes and shoes and also works at the Las Dos Torres restaurant but during days.  Luisa sells clothes and cosmetics.

Chirinzane was born on the 2nd of March, 1959, in Xai Xai in the Gaza province.  She attended school only until the 5th grade because her parents lacked the resources to support her studies. At 10 years old, she and her parents moved to Maputo, to where her father's work was transferred. At 19 years old, her father died, and she was left to live with her mother. Life became extremely difficult. At the age of 22, she and her husband moved in together. Since her husband's salary was insufficient, in 1999 she started selling wood. Through a friend, she came to know Hluvuku and asked for a loan of 800 dollars to purchase more wood in order to increase the volume of her sales. <p> This business has made a positive and visible impact on this family. It has allowed them to rent an apartment and purchase a vehicle, which her husband uses for his taxi service. The community has been impacted also by this business, which supplies quality wood for the production of furniture and construction of houses. In the future, after fortifying her business with the loan, she intends to construct a house for her children. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nAtalia

Her business ultimately failed, however, which led her to look at other ways to make a living.  That's how she came, 10 years ago, to setting up a business making clothing for kids.  She has two sewing machines and a \"remalladora\" (a specialist sewing machine) at her house.  She sells the clothes that she makes in a market near her house.  She also makes wool hats.\r\n<p>\r\nHer husband lives in Cajamarca and he still has a machine for making earrings.  Gerarda sends materials for making earrings to him there and he turns them into products that he ultimately sells.  Gerarda also goes once a month to Pucalipa where she sells second hand merchandise--cookware, toys, etc.--that she buys in Lima.  She's been doing this for 8 years.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan that Gerarda has requested will be used to buy materials that her husband needs to make earrings.  Gerarda would also like to have a \"recubridora\" (a specialist sewing machine) to improve her clothes-making business.  She'd also like to make improvements to her house.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nHace 16 a\u00f1os, Gerarda fabricaba aretes de fantas\u00eda por mayor. Sin embargo, el negocio no fue bien y quebr\u00f3, por lo que tuvo que evaluar nuevas posibilidades de trabajo.  Fue as\u00ed que Gerarda desde hace 10 a\u00f1os se dedica a la costura de ropa de ni\u00f1os. Ella tiene dos m\u00e1quinas de coser y una remalladora en su casa. La ropa que fabrica la vende en el mercado que est\u00e1 cerca de su casa. Tambi\u00e9n teje sombreros de lana. \r\n<p>\r\nSu esposo vive en Cajamarca y \u00e9l a\u00fan conserva una m\u00e1quina que suelda aretes, por lo que Gerarda le manda los materiales all\u00e1 y \u00e9l se encarga de soldarlos y venderlos. Asimismo, Gerarda viaja una vez al mes a Pucallpa a vender cosas de segunda mano, como ollas, mu\u00f1ecas, etc. que compra en Lima.
