Merelyn is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw items to expand product offering. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Merelyn from HSPFI.

Asmar lives in the southern part of Azerbaijan in the town of Imishli. Asmar is married and has one son and two daughters, aged 23 and 21. Asmar gets a monthly pension in the amount of 85 AZN. This income is not sufficient for her big family, consisting of 5 members. In 2004, Asmar decided to start her cattle-breeding business and since then her income has considerably increased. She also breeds other types of livestock. Asmar is very grateful, because with this first loan in the amount of 1000 AZN that she received from Aqroinvest and Kiva, she was able to buy two more cows. Now she has five cows and her family's monthly income from this business is 250 AZN. Asmar is a very industrious woman. Her goal is to increase the number of cows to eight.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":680817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy two cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Imishli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.869722 48.06","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asmar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":111.35,"local_amount":87.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T22:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":88.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191532771},{"amount":100.58,"local_amount":78.89,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-19T08:05:55Z","rounded_local_amount":80.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196334215},{"amount":112.61,"local_amount":88.32,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":89.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201229803},{"amount":101.55,"local_amount":79.65,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-17T07:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":81.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206372574},{"amount":103.31,"local_amount":81.03,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-22T07:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":82.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212093172},{"amount":80.38,"local_amount":63.04,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":64.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216449825},{"amount":132.06,"local_amount":103.58,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":105.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221613953},{"amount":107.47,"local_amount":84.29,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":85.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226983263},{"amount":106.02,"local_amount":83.15,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":84.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232742456},{"amount":319.67,"local_amount":250.72,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":254.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238547018}],"funded_date":"2011-01-05T22:52:59Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:21:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Sharfman","image":562243}},{"id":266033,"name":"Lalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lalyn A. lives in the village of Eastern Wao, Lanao del Sur.

He makes ovens and different products, which are sold locally. In addition to his main job, Murtaz is actively involved in family farming activities. The family has a milk cow. They produce cheese and sell it locally. Also Murtaz works in the family's 300 sq meter  greenhouse, where greens are grown. The greens are sold locally as well, to greengrocery retailers. The family's total average monthly income is 800 Laris, which includes the monthly pensions of Murtaz's parents.\r\n\r\nMurtaz requested credit to purchase a polyethylene cover for the greenhouse, as the old one is torn and can\u2019t maintain the required temperature. With the new cover, Murtaz will be able to grow high quality greens in the greenhouse and sell them for a good price. This will positively impact on the income of the family. Murtaz will use the additional income to finance the daily expenses of his big family.

Hermelinda is a hard-working woman who owns a store and dining room where she offers meals to 30 employees of a factory near her home. Her passion for work began with the purchase of milking cows, from which she sold the milk and cheese she made herself. Upon seeing the necessity of a store in her neighborhood, she sold the cows and with that capital she began a well-stocked store and butcher shop where she could serve a greater number of customers. After 5 years of hard work and effort to always treat customers well and give them the best variety of products and prices, she was victim of 3 assults and robberies in her business. This caused a great loss to her business and forced her to close the doors of her business. Hermelinda says that this bad experience only held her back for a few months, and in that same year construction began of a large paper factory across from her home. Herme, as her friends call her, did not let this opportunity pass by. She approached those in charge of the work and offered lunch service for the workers, who accepted since day one. This business has been going for 7 years and little by little she restocked once again with the dream of having her store again, as it was before. Her loan is designated to buying merchandise for her store, such as sugar, tea, rice, meat, flour, noodles, oil, vegetables, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa Sra.

Currently the walls are made from wooden slats and Julio would like to better insulate the room. Though this home improvement is necessary for the health of the family and in his opinion should come first, Julio hopes to apply for further loans in the future that would allow him to buy a chain saw for his wood-cutting work.

This is 45 year old Asha N. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with three children, between the ages of 12 and 16. Asha has been running a grocery business. She works at the business for 13-16 hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by one employee. Asha currently earns about 200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase grocery items. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and variety of the stock. Asha thanks you for your support!\r\n\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":271548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

They live in the community of Zhidmad, which is 50 minutes away from the city of Cuenca.  Zhidmad is known for its beautiful scenery and the natural state of its vegetation.  Most of its residents and involved in agriculture and raising livestock.  The majority of the young people have migrated to the city in search of job opportunities.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Zoila J. is a member of the August 14th Communal Bank.  She lives in the district of Guayan which is where the community of Zhidmad is located.  Zoila is married.  Her husband works as a mason, which allows him to support the family financially so that they can move forward.  She and her husband own their home, which resulted after many years of effort and sacrifice.\r\n<p>\r\nZoila raises chicken and cows and is also involved in farming.  Her mother taught her how to perform these tasks when she was a young girl.  She gets along well with her friends and Communal Bank associates because they have known each other since childhood.  This is her eighth loan cycle and each one has helped her improve a little bit at a time.  Sra. Maria B. was the person who convinced her to join the Communal Bank.  Zoila tells us that her business has greatly benefited from the loans.  She will use her current loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR to buy compost for her pasture.  Her greatest dream is to finish construction of her house.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Nancy B. lives in the community of Cashapata in Zhidad Parrish.  She is 27 years old and married.  Her husband chops wood for a living since he does not work due to an accident he suffered in which he nearly fractured his spine.  His arm required surgery and metal plates.  Nancy spends her time performing household chores, but she also raises pigs, cows, and chickens.  Most of these animals are for personal consumption since there is little grass as a result of the drought in the region.  She is participating in her eighth loan cycle with the Foundation.  Nancy feels at peace because the loans have helped her household.  Her mother was the person responsible for convincing her to join the Communal Bank.  With her loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, she will purchase food for her animals, such as grasses, and feed for her pigs.  Her greatest dream is for her children to have an education so that they can pursue successful careers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

He is a dairy farmer near Litein in Western Kenya and has been farming for twelve years. He sells his milk through the Kenya Cooperative Creameries and also earns income from small-scale farming of coffee and tea. He says that the main challenges to his business are diseases that affect his livestock and lack of sufficient feed.\r\n\r\nHe requested this first loan through Juhudi Kilimo for Kes. 40,000 to purchase and insure a dairy cow. He says that the added dairy cow will increase his family's income and that, in the future, he would like to produce over fifty liters of milk a day and construct a modern dairy unit that can keep up to five cows.\r\n\r\nHe thanks Juhudi Kilimo for this loan and says that he will request further funding from Juhudi after he completes this

She has benefited already from these loans, as her previous credit helped her to set up her store in her home.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Charnes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":522381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase items for her small store, such as basic grains, milk, sodas, chicken, meat, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-04-10T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Urania Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.63,"local_amount":1002.69,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1011.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144640174},{"amount":49.99,"local_amount":1052.48,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1061.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821966},{"amount":44.88,"local_amount":944.83,"processed_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":953.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561976},{"amount":95,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2018.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204782},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330479},{"amount":95,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2018.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097785},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348411},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:05:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766092}],"funded_date":"2010-04-29T20:20:19Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:05:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily charnes","image":51249}},{"id":196392,"name":"Marjorie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marjorie B. is a 34-year-old woman from the village of Taglimao, Cagayan de Oro City.

Marjorie has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Marjorie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services. As a result, she was able to engage in business activities and, in turn, to improve her standard of living. Marjorie has recently successfully repaid a loan in the amount of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI. That prior loan was used to purchase additional inventory and to increase her working capital. Marjorie is now requesting another loan, this time in the amount of 16,000 PHP ($375), which will be used to further expand the business. Notably, this loan would be the fifth loan taken out by Marjorie from HSPFI.

It\u2019s composed of \u201ctepetl\u201d- \u201chill\u201d and \u201cc\u201d \u2013 at.  It is a very beautiful place with very varied flora.  This communal bank has 9 members; most of this area\u2019s residents raise livestock.\r\n\r\nIsidora L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez is the group representative.  She is a hard working, 34 year old woman, married to Fidel P\u00e9rez L\u00f3pez who raises cattle.  She has four children who are 14, 8, 5 and 1 respectively; two of them go to school.\r\n\r\nIsidora sells fruit and vegetables like: tomatoes, onions, chilies, bananas, apples, potatoes, mandarins, garlic, and eggs, among others.  This is why she requested a loan: to buy more vegetables and thus higher profits because lately sales have been very low and she does not earn enough to restock and sometimes there\u2019s just money enough to eat.  She\u2019s been selling these products at home for ten years.\r\n\r\nAnother group member is Mrs. Zoila Hern\u00e1ndez , 54.  She is married to Mr. Juan L\u00f3pez who is a farmer.  She has 5 children four of whom are married and one who passed away.  She has four little children dependent on  her since her daughter, their mother, died a year ago.  She works very hard to provide food for them.  She has to go out to sell all kinds of articles for the home and clothing door-to-door in different towns.  Zoila works very hard to support her grandchildren.  Despite her age, she\u2019s a strong woman who has worked for over 30 years.  She used to be in other activities.  She asked for the loan to buy more products like: trays, plates, glasses, spoons, soap dishes and buckets to have a bit more stock and earn a bit more profit because the money her husband earns is insufficient.  Since he\u2019s a farmer he only earns money when he harvests and sells his fruit and sometimes the harvest is just barely enough for them to feed themselves.  Zoila is very grateful to the people who provide help to humble people like them; that lend them money so that they can continue working.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group are:\r\n\r\nIsidora L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez, 34, who is a vegetable merchant.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda X P\u00e9rez, 30, who will buy ingredients to bake bread to sell.\r\n\r\nZoila Hern\u00e1ndez X, 54, who will buy plastic

Their objective is to take advantage and benefits from the booming tourist sector of the economy. <p>Both Dan & Carolyne, being young people, are full of plans on how to grow their business working with partners all over Africa, the USA, Europe and Asia.  They hope to franchise their concept and one day have Zindua Africa Safaris representatives all over the world. <p>The business is now 2 months old and they are constrained for capital to buy the items that they require. With the loan of  $1200 they plan to hire an expert to help them launch their website, develop some advertising materials and buy a computer & printer. As a way of tackling the unemployment crisis prevailing in the country, PEMCI has been considering providing venture capital to support innovative business ideas, especially among the youth. Zindua Africa Safaris plans to recruit many Kenyan youth and others from all over the world in promoting their business idea. We see promise and we recommend support for this endeavour in anticipation of the great impact that it can have on the youth in this country and in the wider economy and its people."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":39476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy communication equipment, set-up website, produce advertising materials and purchase a computer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Tigoni, Limuru","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":27,"posted_date":"2007-06-01T19:09:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-17T03:38:58Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T09:17:45Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33011},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-08-17T09:18:28Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":43708},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-09-17T09:18:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":55682},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-10-17T09:18:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68552},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-11-17T10:19:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82677},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-12-17T10:20:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98363},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":117051},{"amount":400,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2008-05-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212279},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-06-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":240395}],"funded_date":"2007-06-03T03:38:58Z","paid_date":"2008-06-17T09:03:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":15284,"name":"Florencia","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<h4>Business Description<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Mrs. Florencia has dedicated herself to the sale of home products such as: pans, sheets, clothing, etc. She also sells candy to public buses' passengers.

Unfortunately, she does not have enough money to fully stock her store. She really enjoys buying and selling products and being in direct contact with people, so she has decided to have others look after her cattle so that she can devote herself fully to the store.

For two years, she has sold cosmetics by catalog.  She sells one of the most well-known brands in the country.  Every day she goes to the homes of her friends, neighbors, and other people that she knows to sell her products.  Then, in the afternoons, she takes inventory of what she sold and the orders she took.  Days later, she visits her customers again to collect the money, since she generally sells on credit.  Although it is tiring to do this work, it gives her great satisfaction.  She has her own goals, which she reaches every month.  In the near future, Vilma hopes to establish a sales stand in a central commercial area in her community.  This is her first loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she is very grateful for the inviitation they gave her to become a part of her current communal bank where her fellow members are on their fifth loan.

She supports three minor children; two other daughters are married and don\u2019t depend on her any longer.\r\n\r\nShe states that many years ago she sold cell phones but, because she didn\u2019t know much about the devices, she was swindled out of much money and needed to start over again from square one in a new business.\r\n\r\nThe sale of skirts and blankets is something she knows very well and she is able to unfold in it easily.  Lucia knows where to buy fabric to make skirts and blankets and, if she needs help, one of her daughters steps in.  She is asking for 2000 bolivianos.\r\n\r\nShe states that what she likes best about Pro Mujer meetings is sharing with her fellow members, to chat, to laugh; she also likes the savings she can make with each payment because she knows that she will gradually amass fall-back capital.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":504901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy fabric, lining, embroidery hoop, thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2010-03-13T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2400,"lender_count":81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josefa Violeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":16666.65,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.36},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.36},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.36},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.01},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.01},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.01},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":2083.36,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:05:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2099.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136735978},{"amount":300.01,"local_amount":2083.36,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2099.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136735979},{"amount":600.01,"local_amount":4166.72,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4199.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144769367},{"amount":900.01,"local_amount":6250.08,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6299.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151951843},{"amount":299.97,"local_amount":2083.13,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:54:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2099.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159691376}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T01:43:03Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:54:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":188214,"name":"Jackline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jackline O. is a 29 year old mother of four children who lives in Nyalenda Kisumu Kenya.

Her previous loan of PHP 26000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

He was never married. Candido has 12 children: 6 girls and 6 boys. He lives with 5 of them with ages between 5 and 14 years old. The other and oldest ones are all employed and have their own families. Candido is also responsible for his parents who still live in Inhambane; he sends them MTn 600 every month.\r\n\r\nIn 1974, Candido decided to go to Namaacha, a village from the province of Maputo which borders Swaziland, to look for work. He was hired as a permanent teacher there because he had completed high school plus a 2-year education training program. Candido has worked in the same school for 33 years as a teacher and also as a principal. He works from 6:45am until 12:10pm and then from 3:30pm until 6:30pm earning a monthly salary of MTn 8,015. The maximum he has been able to save from that is MTn 2,000 but this does not happen frequently.\r\n\r\nThis is Candido's first loan request from Hluvuku and Kiva. Candido already lives in his own home but he is building a second one for his children and his second wife. After hearing about Hluvuku from friends, Candido decided to make the request in the amount of MTn 10,000 that will help in the construction. He wishes to purchase more material and speed up the work. \r\n\r\nThe greatest dream Candido has is the completion of his children's education, preferably at the university level.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p> \r\n\r\nCandido tem 55 anos de idade e \u00e9 natural da prov\u00edncia de Inhambane. Solteiro porque nunca casou oficialmente, Candido tem 12 filhos, 6 meninas e 6 rapazes, mas vive somente com 5 deles, com idades entre 14 e 5 anos. Os mais velhos j\u00e1 s\u00e3o empregados e tem suas fam\u00edlias. Alem disso, Candido tem sob sua responsabilidade os pais que ainda moram em Inhambane, enviando-lhes mensalmente MTn 600.  \r\n\r\nEm 1974 Candido decide ir a Namaacha, uma vila na prov\u00edncia de Maputo e na fronteira com a Swazilandia, a procura de emprego. Foi contratado como professor permanente por j\u00e1 ter conclu\u00eddo o ensino m\u00e9dio e a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de professores de 2 anos. Candido trabalha na mesma escola como professor, e hoje em dia como diretor tamb\u00e9m, fazem 33 anos. Trabalha das 6:45h as 12:10h e das 15:30h as 18:30h e recebe um sal\u00e1rio mensal de MTn 8,015. Candido consegue poupar no m\u00e1ximo MTn 2,000 por m\u00eas, mas n\u00e3o frequentemente.\r\n\r\nEste ser\u00e1 o primeiro empr\u00e9stimo de Candido com a Hluvuku e com Kiva. Candido j\u00e1 mora em sua pr\u00f3pria casa, mas esta construindo uma segunda casa para seus filhos e segunda mulher. Apos ouvir sobre a Hluvuku com colegas de trabalho, Candido decidiu pedir este empr\u00e9stimo de MTn 10,000 para ajudar na constru\u00e7\u00e3o.

Vive con su esposo y sus dos  hijos. \nLa comunidad en la cual vive do\u00f1a Roxana se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago. \n\nEs una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nDo\u00f1a Roxana se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de leche y queso como una forma de generar ingresos para su familia. Dice estar muy contenta porque gracias a este proyecto ha podido salir adelante y ayudarle a su esposo con los gastos de la casa y de los ni\u00f1os. \n\nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive Jos\u00e9 Eduardo es famoso en todo Costa Rica. Es un queso fresco que se le conoce tradicionalmente como \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d. A los \u201cticos\u201d (como se les conoce a los habitantes de Costa Rica) les gusta mucho consumir este producto; se le encontrar\u00e1 en las mesas acompa\u00f1ando cualquier tipo de comida.  Por esta raz\u00f3n, el mercado para dicho producto es realmente bueno.\n\nDo\u00f1a Roxana desea obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito por un monto de \u00a2500.000 (quinientos mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera m\u00e1s y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche. Ella sabe que contar con una vaca m\u00e1s es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo. Sin embargo, el deseo de ser una microempresaria exitosa y  sacar adelante a su familia mejorando las condiciones de vida, la motiva a esforzarse con gran esmero y dedicaci\u00f3n.\n\nDo\u00f1a Roxana es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la micro financiera EDESA.

F. is a young lady, 25 years of age, who lives with her husband and two children.  The community where they live is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, in Cartago Province.\r\nIt's a small rural community of some 2,000 residents.  The townspeople work at producing milk and growing coffee.  \r\nThe area has a varied terrain and much of the land is preserved as tropical rain forest.  The community has very picturesque scenery which combines tropical forest with two beautiful lagoons, coffee plantations and dairy farms.  El Sauce is located about 90 minutes by bus from the nearest commercial center, Turrialba.  However, at various times of the year the road is impassable due to the flooding that afflicts the area.  This is without a doubt one of the principal challenges for the community.\r\nWhen there was nothing to do, many people decided to leave to look for work in Turrialba or in the banana plantations located in the Atlantic zone of Costa Rica.  Currently the prices for coffee and milk have improved and therefore the locals are looking to invest in projects in this area so as to avoid having to migrate.\r\nDo\u00f1a Roxana works at producing milk and cheese as a way of generating income for her family.  She say she is very satisfied because thanks to this project she has been able to get ahead and help her husband with the expenses for their household and the children.\r\nThe cheese from the region where she lives, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo, is famous throughout Costa Rica.  It is a \"queso fresco\" (fresh cheese) which is traditionally known as Turrialba-style.  Ticos, as Costa Ricans are called, love to consume this product and it is found on the table as an accompaniment to all types of food.  For this reason the market for this product is quite good.\r\nDo\u00f1a Roxana would like to obtain a micro-credit loan of 500,000 Colons in order to buy another milk cow so as to increase milk production.  She knows that having another cow is a great sacrifice and will require more work.  However, the desire to be a successful small businesswoman and to get started improving her family's living conditions motivates her to exert herself with great care and dedication.\r\nDo\u00f1a Roxana is a client of the Producers' Association of El Sauce, a member organization of EDESA Micro-Finance.  This will be her first loan and she hopes to continue growing both personally and economically.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kvaka, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

From a very early age, his mother, who was head of household, taught him how to negotiate; this is his greatest experience to date.  \r\n\r\nJoaquin brings low-cost shoes from La Guajira and sells them via four traveling salespeople, himself and his wife, who also works in the business located next-door to their home.

His business made it possible for him to buy his house, he was able to get loans from Fundaci\u00f3n  Mario Santo Domingo that allowed him to set up a shop, to buy display cases and to help his working capital go farther.\r\n\r\nBecause Joaqu\u00edn is a man with big dreams who is part of a Christian community, he wants all his fellow church members to have jobs.  This is why he wants to extend his business into areas not currently served for which he will need salespeople.  This way he intends to help his congregation's brothers who don't have jobs to produce their own earnings.\r\n\r\nHis greatest challenge is when health problems arise in his family; this is when his income is adversely affected because he's an excellent member of the family.  However, he is consistent in his work and is very responsible; this is why he always gets ahead.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

El proyecto le es muy interesante.\n\nActualmente Alberth est\u00e1 solicitando un micro cr\u00e9dito de \u00a2200.000 (doscientos mil colones) para  darle mantenimiento a dicha finca por medio de fertilizantes y herramientas agricolas. Con esto el espera hacer crecer su negocio, ya que su meta es tener un mejor lugar de trabajo donde se pueda instalar bien con sus animales y mejorar tanto su calidad de vida como la de su familia. \n\nAlberth es socio de la Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal de Delirio, una de las 110 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica. Este ser\u00e1 su primer pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico adem\u00e1s de participar activamente en la organizaci\u00f3n de cr\u00e9dito en su comunidad.\n","en":"Alberth is a 41-year-old man living with his wife and children in La Fuente, Cartago Province.  The main drainage system of this zone is the Reventaz\u00f3n River which arises on Cueric\u00ed Hill.  Because of the fertility of the volcanic and alluvial soils, Cartago is a population center that has farming and animal husbandry as its main economic sources.\r\n\r\nAlberth has had a farm for several years now since he now owns property his parents passed down to him but he lacks the main thing needed for his business to take off and for his community to be benefitted.  The project is very interesting.\r\n\r\nAt present, Alberth is asking for a \u00a2200.000 (two-hundred thousand) colon micro loan to maintain his farm.  He hopes with this to help his business grow because his goal is to have a place of work where he can set himself up well with his animals and improve both his and his family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\nAlberth is a member of the \u201cDelirio\u201d (Frenzy) communal bank, one of EDESA\u2019s 110 social organizations in Costa Rica.  This will be his first loan and he hopes with it to continue growing both personally and economically as well as to participate actively in his community\u2019s credit

Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence increased profit levels. \n\nSarah is really visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. Sarah believes that through the loan, she will turn around her family life and be able to give her children a solid educational background. This loan will be Sarah\u2019s way out of poverty.\nHelp Sarah to accomplish her dreams with this loan she\u00b4s requesting.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2047935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Currently, her family's income comes mainly from fishing. Everyday, she and her husband fish and sell to the fish retailers in the village, earning 100,000 to 150,000VND (about 6USD to 9USD) each day. Her family lives near Day river so fishing is very convenient. She has 2 children. They are all grown up with stable works and incomes, so the income from fishing is not only enough for daily expenses but also enough for them to save and invest in further business. This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to purchase new net for fishing.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Yen Thanh Pham, Kiva

In the past, she tried to sell perfume; however, she is now switching to smaller, less expensive items because she can sell more. Eventually, she would like to sell perfume again and open a small shop.\r\n<p>\r\nVirginia is also the group coordinator for the Bank of Hope Los Geranios.

She is 29 years old and a single mother of a 10 and a 3 years old, the older one goes to school. She finished 10th grade but couldn't keep studying because of her parent's financial situation. She lives in her own house with her children and does not support anyone else. \r\n\r\nShe owns a business and she's been working on it for 10 years, every day by herself from 7AM to 4PM. She mostly sells kitchen utensils and makes between 500MT and 1.000,00MT a day (U$15 and U$35). With that money she supports her kids and tries to save some. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a 10.000,00MT loan (U$350) which she'll use to buy more inventory for her business (kitchen utensils and food products). She hopes to pay this loan without a problem so she can ask for another one in the future to finish building her house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

She has been doing this for 13 years.  What she likes the least is walking all day because the weather is not always good.  Rayna wants to buy a cart where she could sell her salted beans and other products like; peanuts, French fries, etc.  She knows that if she works hard she can get ahead for the good of her children.  This is her first loan with MFP, and she is committed to paying it back on time without fail.  She would like to be able to have more loans.  She is very quiet, but she always participates in the decisions of her community bank.  With the 500 PEN she will increase her working capital.  She will buy more ingredients to make her salted beans and improve her income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":293056,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy products and ingredients for the preparation of her salted beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-24T19:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":90.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117325},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":90.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012331},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:20Z","rounded_local_amount":90.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595920},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":90.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990183},{"amount":29.06,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":90.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211308},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":92.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640822}],"funded_date":"2009-03-24T19:48:51Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":101372,"name":"Munavar","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440 -

Her husband had to leave the city to work, leaving her as the head of household.  For the past 20 years she has made a variety of clothing items, which she designs according to models that she sees in catalogs and magazines, to make her clothing something new that attracts people\u2019s attention.  This activity requires a lot of creativity and speed, due to the orders that she is constantly receiving.  She tries to speed up her work until late at night, which has begun to affect her vision because of the effort that she makes.  However, this is not enough to stop her; on the contrary, this motivated her to find new ways to keep on working, one of them being the purchase of a sewing machine that helps her speed up and improve her work.  In the near future Carmen would like to open a general store because she is convinced that over the coming years she will not longer be able to work as a seamstress and she would like to have a business that can cover her expenses during old age.

A. is 41 years old and married to Renato A., who is a 46 year-old tinsmith. They have seven children ranging in age from 6 to 18 years old, who are all going to school. The family lives in the village of Brgy. Rafaela Barrera, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. Lemilda and her husband dream of sending their children to school and when they finish their studies, be gainfully employed in a stable job in the future. That\u2019s why the couple strive so hard to achieve their dreams for their children.\r\n\r\nBefore she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, she and her husband already owned a tin shop because her husband was a skilled tinsmith. They made knives, tongs, different kitchen tools and farm equipment. Lemilda assisted her husband in producing some of the products, but she did most of the selling and managed the business. When demand for their products reached a critical point where they needed capital infusion so they could take it to the next level, Lemilda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so she could borrow the capital to buy more materials to make more products to sell. With the additional capital, their income also increased and because she paid all of the installments on time and paid off the loans within its loan term, Lemilda was able to maintain a good credit record, and still earn an average net income of PHP 15,000 per month.\r\n\r\nFrom the time she and her husband started the business 22 years ago, she has seen a big improvement to it, especially after she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon. To continue the momentum of her business, she borrowed PHP 19,500 on her previous loan to use as revolving working capital for her tin shop. Now she is borrowing the same amount again so that she will have enough working capital to continue buying the necessary materials for the production of the tools and farm equipment that they make and sell to earn their living.\r\n\r\nLimilda and her husband Renato are shown in the picture in their tin shop.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":401437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal

Shahodat is married with two children. She launched her enterprise five years ago with the assistance of her husband. Today, she is still selling fabrics for national dresses at the famous market of her city. Shahodat has about $2,000 invested in merchandise and her net profit is about $200 each month. Her affordable pricing policy causes good turnover of her inventory and brings Shahodat high profits. \r\n\r\nShahodat is seeking a loan of 7,500 Somoni to increase her turnover and sales rates. Shahodat started this business when she couldn't find any other way to support herself and her family, so this venture is just like her baby, and she is very excited to see it expand and become sustainable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M. is 41 years old and in a common law marriage.  He has seven children who are his biggest priority.\r\n\r\nHe wants to repair his truck so that he can continue his meat transport business in the southern zone of the country and continue generating income for the wellbeing of his family.  He has dedicated himself to driving trucks for many years and currently has many meat transport routes.  He wants to give better service, which is why he needs to repair the truck.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan from FUDECOSUR.  He has not had problems with his truck until now, but he does want to continue growing his small business to improve his household and wellbeing.  He has not had loans with state banks, but FUDECOSUR granted this loan with ease and much lower interest rates.\r\n\r\nHe also wants to provide his children and his partner with daily meals.  He can do this if he repairs his truck so that he can keep making a living from day to day.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":643723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"Truck repair for delivery business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"San Rafael de Brunka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2010-11-19T22:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ronald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.99,"local_amount":16994.13,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":17255.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283133323},{"amount":966.01,"local_amount":483004.2,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":490432.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308399067}],"funded_date":"2010-12-07T20:33:25Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:04:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Flavia Garcia (vol)","image":1574380}}]}
