When the amount of produce increases, the price lowers, but overall it is a good business with daily sales, whether of bagged salads or whole fruit.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Jos\u00e9 wants to increase his family's sales.  He will buy a sack of carrots, 46kg of potatoes, 46kg of onions, sweet pepper, cabbage, tomatoes, 98kgs of oranges, watermelons, melons, bananas, cucumbers, hard squash, and other products.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, both sales and revenue will increase, which is the goal Jos\u00e9 hopes to achieve.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva

18 associates from Temuco City. This is the second loan they seek from Kiva lenders. These individuals' livelihoods consists of sales of seasonings (garlic, oregano, and merk\u00e9n), canned goods, fast foods (fried pies, buns and completos (Traditional Chilian Hot Dogs), lingerie, perfumes, and home d\u00e9cor items (sheets, towels, tablecloths).\r\n\r\nJacqueline can be found in the third row and first from the left; she is wearing a green jacket. Jacqueline\u00b4s business consists of a small grocery store located in front of her house.  Jacqueline has managed this store for the past 15 years.  Jacqueline plans to use this loan to purchase merchandise such as perishable and non-perishable food items for her store.  As the market has been getting more competitive, she would like to offer a greater variety and change some of the items she currently offers; for example, a larger variety of vegetables, firewood and charcoal items. \r\n\r\nEven though Jacqueline is affected by thyroid disease, she remains full of life due to her business. Jacqueline's household consists of her mother and her 19-year-old daughter, who also works.  Jacqueline also has an 18-year-old son who is serving in the military. \r\n\r\nWhat Jacqueline has found most appealing about Fondo Esperanza is that they are quick to inform her about the progress of her loan. \r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. It is located 670 kilometers south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and is the location for a number of lakeside spa resorts and striking native flora and fauna. This region is also noteworthy for being the region where 50% of Chile's existing indigenous Mapuche community live; some of whom are members of Fondo Esperanza communal banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":586218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately 1200000 SLL. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Minkailu plans to sell wholesale to supply other traders. He also hopes to continue to educate his children to the university level. He is serious and determined. He thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":642760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy more plastic slippers for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2010-11-18T14:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minkailu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":450000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":459562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188635390},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":459562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191378296},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":459562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195796241},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-20T07:58:56Z","rounded_local_amount":459562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201881784},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":459562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206104713},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":459562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211175095},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":459562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216457878},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T07:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":459562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221796657},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:34:56Z","rounded_local_amount":459562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226991051},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-16T07:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":459562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232750195}],"funded_date":"2010-11-21T11:21:41Z","paid_date":"2011-10-16T07:50:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":253436,"name":"Cristo Redentor 5 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ramona is one of the members of a group called Cristo Redentor 5 (Christ Redeemer).

She has had her business for four years, which started as a stand offering candies and snacks. Now, she operates a 'colmado,' a place where you can find all the ingredients to make your daily food. Normally, colmados are in the same neighborhood within a short walk from any home.  \r\n\r\nShe plans to use this loan to buy rice, flour and other foods. She will use the profits to invest in her business and to save.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began borrowing because she needed capital for her business. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and the sugar cane industry. The main economic activities are a free trading zone and a cement factory.

I Made, 53, lives in the suburban areas near the beach in West Bali. He has been running a pig business for almost 10 years. Previously, he lived in rural areas, but three years ago, he moved to the place he lives in now. \r\n\r\nCurrently he has 21 fattening pigs, 1 sow, 1 male and a cage, which has a width of 10m and length of 2.5 m. His business is growing because he produces good quality pigs. Because the number of pigs is increasing, they produce more and more dirt as well. I Made dug a hole for drainage. Because the hole was not able to accommodate disposal of the waste, it's become pollution for residents around his house. I Made heard about the biogas program from socialization by MUK at the village office. He immediately joined the program and built a biogas reactor in the back of the cage. Currently the construction of the reactor is in progress.

She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her tailoring shop.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 8,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business and to buy raw supplies needed for her shop such as fabrics and thread. She dreams that her business will continue to grow and be successful. She hopes to start expanding her business in the very near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":555689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy raw supplies needed for her shop such as fabrics and thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-06-17T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luzviminda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.67,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2156.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152028718},{"amount":46.66,"local_amount":2133.18,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2156.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159608136},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":2666.79,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2695.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821647},{"amount":23.33,"local_amount":1066.71,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1078.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172088891}],"funded_date":"2010-06-17T19:38:18Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:52:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tiffany S.","image":1008207}},{"id":212470,"name":"Kellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kellen is 54 years old.

Cabacungan, La Castellana, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   Dressmaking \/ Sewing , Ready-to-Wear (RTW) Sales and Food Vending businesses. Eva joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eva has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4700,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to pay for more RTW inventory and materials for her dressmaking businesses so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.  \r\n\r\nEva N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Every day she works in order to move forward in life. This young woman is very hardworking and currently works in realtors office where she offers information and does the paperwork for land or property that is being sold. However, she also works at another business: she has a store where she sells candy and sodas, and her mother helps her to attend to the customers. She feels very satisfied with what she does and gets regular income from both jobs and this allows her to bring up her son alone. Nataly works without rest as she knows she has many goals to accomplish. For this reason, she is planning to buy a car to rent out, and in this way she hopes to improve her income. She also wants to finish building her house. This is the second loan that she has had from MFP and she promises to make her repayments punctually as she doesn't want to be in bad standing with the people who made this loan possible and are helping her to keep working and seeking to improve her situation. Nataly plans to use the loan to buy bulk stocks of candy and soda to supply her store and offer her customers a greater variety of goods.

S. is 35 years old. She is single and has one son, aged 7, whom she plans to give a good education to the university level. \r\n\r\nCarolyne runs a general store in which she sells such items as sugar, rice, flour, cooking oil, beverages and detergents to the local people. Her business is well known by the name Cashim Enterprise and is located at the busy Khayega market in Kakamega. \r\n\r\nKakamega is a busy agricultural area known for large-scale production of sugar cane and commonly known as the sugar belt region. \r\n\r\nCarolyne has been running this business for the last three years and has managed to provide employment for one person. She says that this business is profitable. The major challenge she faces is the fact that people in the area do not have a lot of money so they do not buy many items thus locking up capital in the slow moving stock.

He lives in Soledad, the city with the highest population growth in Colombia.  He has a fruit and vegetable business, involving three barrows manned by his sons.  They are dispersed around the city and in the metropolitan area.  He started in this field some years ago with three mule carts in a neighborhood in the southwest of Barranquilla, but he had to leave his home because of erosion and moved to Soledad, with help from the state.  He could not find a space to keep carrying out this activity, so he sold his mule carts and invested in the barrows, and as his business grew, his sons began working with them.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that he has requested from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation because he needs to buy a greater amount of fruit and vegetables; at the moment, he does not have enough working capital to increase his sales because he buys on a daily basis and in small quantities.

She was born in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone. She is married to a local court chairman. The 2 of them have 2 children. One of their children is in Junior Secondary School II (JSS II) and the other is in class VI. She has been in business for 6 years now. Kadiatu sells firewood, plastics, water, and gara lappers (locally dyed clothes). <p>\r\n\r\nWith this loan of Le 1,000,000.00, Kadiatu will use it to buy one truck load of firewood and 3 \u201cpieces\u201d (a piece is about 30 yards of white cotton used in making the gara lappers). A truck load of firewood costs Le 500,000 in a village called Madit, about 5 miles from Makeni. A piece of \u201cbrillian\u201d (the white cotton is called brillian) costs Le 80,000.

Ismael has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 4,350 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2010, Ismael joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ismael is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to repair an existing vehicle for better service. This will be the first loan taken out by Ismael from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the family. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

She is from the Chuka area, an area that is very affected by poverty, inequality and social conflict. She intends for her family to get ahead through her hard work and effort without complaint. Lispar has spent the past 10 years of her life farming. She sells milk, poultry and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in a personal business to make ends meet. Lispar is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. <br \/><br \/>Of all the activities in which she involves herself, dairy farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and milk her cows and feed them with fodder that has high nutritional value. She is so keen and close with her cows, she has named them, which makes Lispar very proud, and she feels fulfilled. Dairy farming being a very profitable business venture, Lispar wants to take full advantage. She would like to expand her dairy business, but the biggest challenge she faces is feeding her cows. <br \/><br \/>She is respectfully asking for a loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device that is used for cutting hay into smaller pieces before being mixed with other forages for easy digestion by the cow. The loan will assist the cow in producing more milk because they will have plenty of food to feed on. The profits from milk sales will allow Lispar to grow her business further, by starting to package milk and by processing it into other dairy products. In addition, she will benefit from the organic manure from the cow. She projects that she will be able to start a bio-gas plant at her farm, which will save her money in fuel costs. With your loan, all that Lispar dreams of is a secure future for her family.

Thi Nguyen, 54 years old, joined the Fund in 2001.  In the past 7 years of participation in the Fund, her family has experience much improvement in their finances and afford more conveniences. She was able to build houses for 3 of her children so each can live on their own.  Two children still live at home with her and are attending school.  In each round of funding, the family invested in farming fish.  With the money invested they were able to have the fish pond right near their house so the business of tending to the fish was very favorable.  Her husband is a hardworking person with an inquisitive mindset in the profession of raising seafood, so the family\u2019s investment in raising fish always brings in a high income.  In this round of funding the family is requesting 11,000,000 VND to continue investing in raising the fish.  Their average income is 5,000,000 VND per month on average.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nTham gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2001, ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L. n\u0103m nay 54 tu\u1ed5i qua 7 n\u0103m tham gia vay v\u1ed1n ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n kinh t\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u00e3 c\u00f3 nhi\u1ec1u thay \u0111\u1ed5i, mua s\u1eafm ti\u1ec7n nghi trong gia \u0111\u00ecnh, x\u00e2y d\u1ef1ng gia \u0111\u00ecnh cho 3 con v\u00e0 \u0111\u1ec1u l\u00e0m cho m\u1ed7i con m\u1ed9t dinh c\u01a1 ra \u1edf ri\u00eang, 2 con \u0111ang s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ecb \u0111\u1ec1u \u0111i h\u1ecdc, c\u00e1c v\u00f2ng v\u1ed1n vay c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u1ec1u \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 v\u00e0o ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i c\u00e1, v\u1edbi l\u1ee3i th\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 ao ngay t\u1ea1i nh\u00e0 n\u00ean vi\u00eac ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i, ch\u0103m s\u00f3c r\u1ea5t thu\u1eadn l\u1ee3i, ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb l\u00e0 ng\u01b0\u1eddi ch\u1ecbu kh\u00f3 lu\u00f4n h\u1ecdc h\u1ecfi kinh nghi\u1ec7m trong vi\u1ec7c nu\u00f4i tr\u1ed3ng th\u1ee7y s\u1ea3n, v\u00ec v\u1eady n\u00ean gia \u0111\u00ecnh anh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 v\u00e0o ao c\u00e1 lu\u00f4n c\u00f3 thu nh\u1eadp cao cho gia \u0111\u00ecnh.

At the bottom of the photo, you can see Ms. Rosalina\u2019s flower and costume jewelry shop. For the past 6 years, she has been selling anthuriums, costume jewelry, stationery, and gifts.  She is requesting the loan to invest in her business and plans to add some groceries to her inventory in order to offer more variety.  Her customers regard her as a very hard-worker.  The business is located in the front part of her home.  \r\n\r\nWhen applying for this loan, she felt very happy because she knew she would be able to make her business grow a bit.  She is 64 years old, studied up to the 6th year of primary school, lives in a common-law relationship and has 3 children (one daughter and two sons).  She wants this loan to invest in more merchandise and buy groceries so that her shop will be better stocked.  In addition, she hopes to increase her income in order to be able to expand her house and build a more weather resistant roof as the laminate roof she has at present has fallen on numerous occasions during the suradas (strong South winds).  .  \r\n\r\nAna Laura L. is president of the group.  She is 29 years old, studied up to the 3rd year of secondary school, is married and has 2 sons.  She has been selling stationery for the past 7 years.  She is requesting this loan to buy stationery in order to maintain sales.\r\n\r\nThe group is made up of the following 11 members:\r\nAnselma H. (footwear sales) \r\nEufrosina S.

He runs a small convenience store where he sells various convenience-food products, including soft drinks, bread, candies, etc. As his convenience store is in a good location with a very limited number of stores around, his daily sales volume is quite good. From the start early this year, his business has been doing well. The business capital has increased from 800,000 MNT to 1,000,000 MNT ($1 USD = 1,450 MNT).

He has been buying and selling caps and hats for ten years.  His home is in Paraje Choescuela, Juchanep Canton, Department of Totonicap\u00e1n in Guatemala.  The demand from his customers is currently growing, but his financial condition is not sufficient and he is in need of additional capital.  For this reason, he has come to Asociaci\u00f3n ASDIR to request a loan with the intention of buying more merchandise to increase his sales.  He also hopes to succeed for his family and provide them better living conditions.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Virginia has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Virginia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virginia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI, a Kiva partner. \r\n\r\nVirginia is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Virginia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":546904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She has lived with Cancio (47 years old) for 20 years, and they have 6 children.  They live with 5 of them in their own home located in Huaricolca.  Her goal is for her children to have a profession and be well set up for life.  For this reason she has been enthusiastic in her work, planting potatoes, peas, and oats.  Because of the way she constantly cares for her crops, this generates solid earnings.  Because there is a water shortage at times, she cannot plant, and she turns to selling the milk produced by her two \"mantona\" cows, thereby assuring her family\u2019s financial wellbeing.  Good mother that she is, she always sees that her children are properly fed.

She works there selling a variety of goods, a business that came out of her efforts to become economically independent and generate income so she can contribute to the development and well being of her household. She began this business 5 years ago, selling a few products on credit to her neighbors and friends, and today she has a large cliental and has added much more.  That is to say, everything that her customers want, Derlis gets for them at a good price and they pay her at agreed deadlines. 80% of her sales are for credit, and 20% are cash sales. She also sells for cash at auctions and receives merchandise from Guajira in the north of Colombia. In this way, she sells clothes, perfumes, costume jewelry, and shoes. She is a good businesswoman and so she gets new clients daily, but her working capital isn't enough to meet their orders immediately. This is the reason she has come to Kiva, and this is the first loan she has requested from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy clothes and especially shoes, an investment that she expects to be successful because it is based on the requests of her clients.

is 35 and single with 2 children of her own.

She has operated her business at this location for the past 5 years and has been a member of her lending group for the past year.\r\n\r\nWith her loan she hopes to add charcoal as one of her products.  Charcoal is inexpensive and very important for outside cooking.  It is her desire to expand her business by slowly adding new items to her inventory.\r\n\r\nAs an interesting side note, most of the people I meet are very welcoming.  In fact, when you arrive in their village the universal phrase is, \u201cYou are most welcome\u201d.  They are also easy to laugh and smile, and they love to have their picture taken.

Sia started selling with 500 Liberian dollars (about $8 USD at today's exchange rate) as working capital, and her business at the time was selling peanuts.\r\n\r\nShe faces challenges in transporting goods to market and faces stiff competition from competitors.  She plans to use her 14,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 62,000 Liberian dollar group loan to purchase additional building materials for her business. Her goal is to grow, be prosperous and get a good standard of living. \r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Sia is the one holding the sign.\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is located in Barrio San Pedro, Actopan in the state of Puebla, Mexico. The group is composed of 7 members that know each other and work in pottery creating articles of clay such as cooking pots, jars, flower pots, and decorative clay figures.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are going to use the loan in the following ways. Guadalupe Calixta M. C. is going to buy pots and flower pots to supply her business. Se\u00f1ora Silvina Lilia C. Guzm\u00e1n is going to buy pots and figures in bulk go supply her business. Se\u00f1orita Ver\u00f3nica Arag\u00f3n C. is going to buy casserole dishes, pots, and figures in bulk to supply her business. Se\u00f1ora Aurora G\u00f3mez Dom\u00ednguez is going to buy clay, glaze, and firewood to make various articles. Se\u00f1ora Escol\u00e1stica M. M. is going to buy clay, firewood, glaze, and celite (a type of clay), and paint to make her items. Se\u00f1ora Leonor C. Mar\u00edn is going to buy clay, firewood, glaze, celite, paint, and white earth to make her pots \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Guadalupe Calixta M. C. is the representative of the group. She is 41 years old and has 4 daughters who study and work in pottery with their mother. They are Rosalia, 23, who studies at the university of Puebla; Claudia, 15, who studies in high school; Reyna, 12, who is in secondary school; and Elizabeth, 10, who is in primary school. All of her daughters help her work, creating the clay products. Se\u00f1ora Guadalupe Calixta studied in secondary school and got her certificate.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and she is seeking it to invest in crafts and pottery and plans to buy jars and flower pots to supply her business. She also plans to buy clay and firewood to create casseroles, pots, and jars. She began her business ten years ago. Her parents taught her to work the clay when she was a girl. She noticed that her mother worked and thought 'why not me?' Now she works from necessity for the support of her family, to continue investing, for the studies of her daughters, and the household expenses. The products she offers her clients are casseroles, pots, jars, flower pots, pedestals, large jars, clay figures, and all type of clay products. The clients that come to buy the crafts are from various parts of the country - the State of Mexico, Puebla, Tampico, Veracruz, and Morelos. For her the business is important because it insures the well being of her family. The favorite part of the work in pottery is when she sells and recieves the money. It gives her great satisfaction when she takes the products out of the oven and the very lovely casseroles and pots are quite brilliant. Her earnings are used to continue investing and for the houshold expenses, and the studies of her daughters. Her hopes are to have health to continue working and that the business continues to prosper, and that, god willing, her daughters graduate and achieve their careers.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group wish to say to Kiva and to the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Reduce the interest rate so you can continue loaning to us and have confidence in us because if we make the payments and if you lower the rate of interest we promise you to get together more clients.\" In the pottery business we face the problem of the weather which may cause the firewood to get wet and the kiln to cause a batch to fail as the glaze falls and the pots come out green and they have to repeat the process, putting on more glaze so they come out shining.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":586311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buy pots and flower pots to supply the business.

They have three children who are between 20 and 24 years old. Helen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,500 to purchase more stock for her sari-sari store so that she can continue to save up for her children\u2019s education and for better living conditions. Helen is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).
