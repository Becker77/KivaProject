With this loan she plans to buy simple grains, cereals and bottled milk, among other things, to help stock her stand.  Her plan is to remodel her home so that she can install a small store and provide better service to her customers and thus, provide an education for her children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ian Nicoll, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":271847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy Grains and Cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T23:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.35,"local_amount":1006.98,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1014.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27039002},{"amount":50.28,"local_amount":1005.76,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:47:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929295},{"amount":50.38,"local_amount":1007.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1015.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384201},{"amount":50.09,"local_amount":1001.87,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890659},{"amount":50.17,"local_amount":1003.37,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1011.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111960},{"amount":48.73,"local_amount":974.37,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":981.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533366}],"funded_date":"2009-03-03T03:26:21Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T09:43:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Nicoll","image":635984}},{"id":93276,"name":"Chhay","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S. is 36 years old and lives in Siem Reap Province.

He is very attentive and concerned, and he has a great desire to shape a good future for himself. Everyday, he leaves his house with his van (VW bus) at around 5 in the morning because he has to wait for his transportation line to give him the orders to leave. His route is number 19, which is one of the most difficult ones to cover because of the large amount of passengers and the bad road conditions, so he has to make a big effort. What Victor most likes is driving, which is why he decided to buy a VW bus (which he is still using) at age 25 with the help of his parents. He thinks that the most difficult part of his job is dealing with people who do not want to pay, or who pay a less than the normal fare. Even so, he knows that this is his job and he has to give it his all. This is his first loan with MFP, and he is very happy for this opportunity to receive one because he is planning to invest it well. He is a very well-respected member of his microfinance institute because he always establishes order in the group.

Su actividad econ\u00f3mica es la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos, lo cual realiza a domicilio y en las calles, por lo que en ocasiones aprovecha las ferias de su ciudad para ofrecer los productos que tiene en stock.

Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es la amistad que hace con sus clientas, pues en sus horas de visita siempre tiene un tiempo para dialogar con ellas. En estos cuatro a\u00f1os como promotora de ventas considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es salir a las calles y realizar las cobranzas, debido a que algunas clientas se retrasan en sus pagos perjudicando su capital de trabajo.

She lives in her own home and her greatest wish is to be in a financial position to educate her daughter.  Her business is the sale of cosmetics out of her home and as a street vendor.  She offers her stock on hand for sale at town fairs; however, in general Yanetd deals in catalog sales.  \r\nThe customers that visit her most frequently are her neighbors and family members, because her great sense of humor has earned her their love. What she likes best about her job is the friendship that she has with her clients, and she always takes time to visit when they come calling. In the four years she has been in sales what has been most difficult is taking to the streets to collect payments, because some customers are behind on their payments and that is impacting her working capital.  In the future she would like to open a cosmetics shop in her home because it is a location that is already familiar to her customers. She is just in need of adequate space and display cases for her products. This is Yanetd's third loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and membership in a community bank has helped her to improve her interpersonal relationships. With the 1000 Peruvian soles that she is requesting, Yanetd will buy products for sale in the catalogs in order to have more stock on hand.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":391690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-21T05:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yanetd","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":126.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997566},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":126.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842915},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":380.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734490},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":126.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992442},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:00Z","rounded_local_amount":126.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717280},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":126.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751037}],"funded_date":"2009-09-21T16:27:31Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":142501,"name":"Rosana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosana is 41 years old  and married to Andres.

Her story is representative of her group and generally of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti. Her group is located in Puerto Plata, a port town on the North Coast with an economy dominated by tourism, where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and two children.\r\n\r\nFelicia is excited to be taking her second loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Republic).  He is married and is raising four children.  Japaraly was born into a simple and large family of a farmer.  Since childhood, he helped his father to take care of a large farm, especially because his father also worked as a driver at the local collective farm and needed help to take care of livestock.  After graduating from school, Japaraly went to serve in the army.  In 1989, Japaraly got married after returning from the army and also started attending a retail college that same year.  He spent two years in college and then got a job as a salesperson at a department store, and then as a security guard at a meat processing plant.  At that time, Japaraly and his wife lived with the parents.  They decided to move out of the parents' home in 1993, and Japaraly and his family moved to their relatives' farm in the Sargo village (Panfilovsk district, Kyrgyzstan).  At that time, they already had two children.  Japaraly took care of his relatives' livestock and also increased the quantity of his own livestock at this same farm because it had suitable conditions for keeping and breeding livestock.  Having lived on this farm for six years and increasing the quantity of his own livestock, Japaraly decided to return to live with the parents because he was their youngest son.  According to Kyrgyz traditions, the youngest son has to take care of his aging parents.  At that time, he had several dairy cows and calves.  In 2009, having sold some of the livestock, Japaraly bought a one-bedroom apartment in the town of Karabalta.  Currently, thanks to his entrepreneurship and persistence, Japaraly has two dairy cows, seven bulls and fifteen sheep.  In order to further expand his business, Japaraly requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock.  Japaraly plans to expand his farm.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":889283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bukara village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-10-07T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Japaraly","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":667.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":778.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":778.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":667.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":30194.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975559},{"amount":778.75,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":35226.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095350},{"amount":778.75,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":35226.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754523}],"funded_date":"2011-11-04T16:34:22Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:19:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":348197,"name":"Solomon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Solomon wants a loan to buy a motorcycle.

She is a friendly, hard-working and enterprising young woman. She is married to her husband, with whom she has a 2-year-old son. They live together in a home they own, working hard every day to provide the best for their young son and give the family a better quality of life. Jessica's job consists of preparing and selling ceviche (a traditional dish). She is co-owner of a ceviche restaurant in the city along with her mother, who owns 70 percent of the business. They work every day. The restaurant is run out of her mother's home, and Jessica leaves for work very early every day because she has to go to city's port in search of the freshest and highest quality fish. She started out as an assistant to her mother, but thanks to a lot of hard work she was able to take on more responsibilities and was given a percentage of the business. She has been working there for five years and it is going very well, enough for her to buy her home and accomplish many things. At first, things were complicated with the business, but now it's going very well and she has big plans for it to keep growing. Jessica, like every young woman, desires to move up in life. In the future she hopes to set up a hardware store in her home, but she knows it requires a much bigger investment. So for now she is dedicated to working hard every day and raising enough capital for her to be able to carry out her dream. This will be her second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she is very content in knowing she will have financial support because she feels it will help her make strides with her work. She also promises once again to be very punctual with her payments, since she doesn't want to let down her fellow members of her community bank who but their trust in her and gave her support for the loan. With the loan she is requesting, Jessica plans to purchase ingredients and supplies to keep working and keep her customers satisfied by offering a wider variety of meals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":923638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase ingredients and supplies to prepare her meals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-21T09:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":148.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":159.72},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":159.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":171.6},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":178.01},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":182.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.78},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.89},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.78,"local_amount":148.74,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":150.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244622064},{"amount":59.89,"local_amount":159.72,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":161.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836167},{"amount":59.66,"local_amount":159.09,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":161.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245931},{"amount":64.35,"local_amount":171.6,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":173.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099044},{"amount":66.75,"local_amount":178.01,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":180.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713187},{"amount":68.57,"local_amount":182.84,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":185.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203210}],"funded_date":"2011-11-21T12:15:34Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":364593,"name":"Dairon Ezequiel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dairon Esequiel tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad vive en uni\u00f3n libre tiene un hijo, vive con la esposa,  padres y el hijo en el Cant\u00f3n Ventanas Provincia de los r\u00edos.\nLa VRC JERUSALEN, se encuentra ubicada en el Recinto El caimito, Perteneciente a la Parroquia Puerto Pechiche Cant\u00f3n Pueblo Viejo, Esta Ventanilla se dedica a labores Agr\u00edcolas de ciclo Corto siembra de ma\u00edz, arroz, frejol Gandul.\nDairon se dedica a la Agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz, arroz hace 10 a\u00f1os las compras y las ventas los realiza en Ventanas.\nSolicita el cr\u00e9dito para la Agricultura ciclo corto de ma\u00edz, arroz.

With 80% of the population not having access to any kind of distributed electricity there was a lot of potential to improve people's lives by giving them access to basic electricity. Most people depend on car batteries and kerosene lights, which is inadequate, inefficient, labor intensive, and unsafe. \r\n\r\nNRG Solutions was established with the goal of providing sustainable, appropriate, and affordable solar energy solutions to Cambodia and S.E. Asia. Our team began working under the name Yejj Solar, as part of a larger NGO. This experience helped us learn about the local and regional market. We tested different models and approaches to the distribution of solar energy into remote areas. Earlier this year we decided to transition out of the NGO model into a social enterprise model, in order to improve sustainability as we saw the need to scale up. Our approach has two fundamental pillars: quality and service. We have slowly introduced Barefoot Power products in order to build the brand and trust in the products. By building a network of entrepreneurs to which we offer constant training and support we are pushing this emphasis of quality and service down to the end customer. This has quickly allowed us to differentiate ourselves from distributors of cheaper products with no after-sales service. \r\n\r\nYour contributions will help us bring much needed stock in order to meet the large demand and grow the business. This stock will then be given to local entrepreneurs we have trained to sell these products in very remote areas of the country, where they are most needed. This loan will help us in that final push to establish our business and the Barefoot Power products into a known and trusted brand. The largest challenge with solar energy in Cambodia is the lack of trust due to the availability of very cheap, low quality products, and no after-sales service support.

He is married and has two independent children. Boturjon is a farmer. He has been working in agriculture for 4 years and has gained much experience and a love for the land. He began cultivating his land through his own efforts and has gradually gotten ahead in life. He has been producing such crops as wheat, onion, potatoes. Each year he has produced a yield sufficient for the family consumption and for selling. \n\nFarming is the family's main source of income.  To generate a stable income, the business requires considerable funding. Boturjon is asking for a loan of $1000 USD. He would like to use this loan to buy supplies for the harvest and to improve production and thus increase the quality of his yield along with his earnings. Boturjon and his family are counting on your help. He thanks all who support him and promises to repay the loan in time.  \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They attend meetings at the German Busch community center.  The group formed recently from the necessity of accessing a loan.  All of them need to increase their working capital.  They all have different businesses like making skirts, selling doll clothes, selling fruit, making filing cabinets, selling plastics, and selling food.\r\n\r\nJhenny Lizethe C. is one of the members of this group.  She is 20, and she was motivated to join the group by an invitation of a friend.  Jhenny has been making Barbie doll clothes for three years.  She took the initiative because her mother sells toys, and lots of her customers asked her for doll clothes.  So, she started to make them.  She will use the loan to buy fabric and lace.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

He has 2 young children who attend school. He has owned a car repair shop and specializes in car body work. He has been involved in this occupation for more than 15 years. With his experience, he has been able to gain a good number of clients asking for his reparation services. He works hard, as he is the only family provider, to support the heavy expenses of his life and to pay for his children's schooling. He plans to make some modifications and expand his shop and to do so, he is asking to borrow $1000 from Kiva's partner Ameen s.a.l. to buy additional tools.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans with Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

His wife is his only dependent although she too helps out because, seeing how difficult the situation is, she tends to a store installed in the house.\n\nBecause of his age, Alejo can no longer look for work; he can\u2019t find employment anywhere.  He used to be a bricklayer and always worked his fields.   He still works in his fields during planting and harvesting but getting a job isn\u2019t a reality anymore.  Therefore, Alejo only raises animals to sell now. Currently he raises lambs and will use the loan to buy baby lambs and a few calves to raise.\n\nFor the moment, Alejo won\u2019t realize any profits.  On the contrary, he\u2019ll have to feed them for a time.  But what helps is that he has harvested and has pasturage to feed them.\n\nAlejo says that he hopes the animals he will buy will produce offspring in a few months so that his economic situation will improve greatly.  Alejo wants to use his profits to save up because at his age and with the economic situation that might develop he will be able to have money available for food and medicines he or his wife might need.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":662262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" To buy lambs and calves to raise and then sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-15T17:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1164.32},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1225},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1317.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.48},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1433.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1502.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.6},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.53},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.29},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.45},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":94.6,"local_amount":1164.32,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1174.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430728},{"amount":99.53,"local_amount":1225,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1235.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195849993},{"amount":107.02,"local_amount":1317.13,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1328.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292265},{"amount":110.29,"local_amount":1357.48,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1369.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160548},{"amount":116.45,"local_amount":1432.67,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1445.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233474},{"amount":122.11,"local_amount":1503.4,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1516.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512365}],"funded_date":"2010-12-16T08:22:26Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":262129,"name":"Keo's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Four people in Preaek Samraong village in Kandal province are forming this group loan.

Prior to the break-up of the Soviet Union, Bakitnur had worked as a veterinarian at a collective farm and then decided to start his own animal husbandry business after the break-up.  Starting with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS), Bakitnur was able to develop his business to yield a monthly income of about 28,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop his business, he requested a loan in the sum of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy calves for fattening up.  He plans to use the income from this loan for repair his house and further increasing livestock headcount."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":870639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tuyp village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-09-13T17:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakitnur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":887.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":887.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":887.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:07Z","rounded_local_amount":40004.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070894},{"amount":887.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:05:56Z","rounded_local_amount":40004.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459362}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T20:17:00Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:05:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":340008,"name":"Elvira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvira is 51 years old and married.

Her story is representative of her group and generally of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti. Her group is located in Puerto Plata, a northern port town where the economy is based on tourism and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her husband and two children.\r\n\r\nBalbina is excited to be taking her fifth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business running a beauty salon, which also happens to be a sandwich shop. She will use the capital to purchase two different lines of hair products, as well as salami, ham, and cheese. She will use the profits to invest in a space to rent for her salon, as well as to construct a second floor to her home to rent out for extra money. She thanks you all for your support. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":547734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Palawan. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: buying and selling livestock and a farming and gardening business. Her husband, Edgardo Q., who is 52 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 17 to 30 years old, four of whom have their own families, and the other two have work to help the family. \r\n\r\nAida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Aida has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $118, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing 18,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for her businesses so that she can continue to save up for their future expansion. Aida Q. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The village is famous for its straw hats. It is here we find Nanny. She is 43 years old, married and has a 24-year-old son who attends a university and still lives at home. Her husband works with heavy machinery. Nelly runs a general store out of her home selling all kinds of products, such as rice, sugar and oils as well as bazaar items, stationery items and some medicines. She works every day from 6 a.m. until 9 p.m. and sometimes later. Her son helps her with the work when he is free. She has had the business for two years and it has grown little by little. She plans to use the loan to better stock her store, purchasing rice, sugar, oils, detergents, notebooks, cards and other primary-need products. She has had four loan cycles with the community bank and enjoys it because the group is very close. Her goals are to make headway with the business and for her store to grow every day.

Svetlana graduated from the Kyrgyz State University with a social sciences teaching major and spent a long time working at the local boarding school.  Unfortunately, her salary did not cover all of her family's expenses, and Svetlana decided to start her own retail business.  She is involved in selling children's clothing because it is traditionally in high demand.  In order to further expand her merchandise selection by adding children's shoes, Svetlana requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.  She plans to use some of the income from the loan to make repairs to her home.

This loan will be a huge support for Susanna who is a very attentive and hard-working woman with a good credit history behind her.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1494143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for seeds and fuel for cultivation and pay for the workforce gathering the harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Brnakot village of Syunik region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":106.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":114.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":117.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":116.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":116.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":119.76},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":119.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":121.72},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":122.72},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":123.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":124.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":124.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":127.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":128.57},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":128.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":129.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":131.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":132.09},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":132.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":134.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":135.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":136.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":137.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.76},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.54},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.72},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.72},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.23},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.74},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Destinee Evers","image":null}},{"id":758605,"name":"Roeurn's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A local farmer from Battambang province, Roeurn is 33 years old and a mother of two children; one is under-aged for schooling and one is in school.

She sells food in the evenings in a spot away from home where she also sets up tables and chairs for her guests to eat. She has been doing this for three years now and likes to take time preparing each dish properly so that her customers can fully enjoy their delicious taste. She also likes to talk to people whilst serving them. This is a highly lucrative business for Aurora since she finds cooking easy and is able to prepare special dishes both quickly and inexpensively, and which prove very popular.

She lives with her life partner and their two sons, both of whom still are dependent on her.  Mar\u00eda Silvia is a hard-working, tenacious woman who decided to set up her own business selling carbonated beverages in a well-equipped environment.  She herself administers her business, without a boss or a set schedule.  She tells us that she started out with 400 soles and bought three cases of soft-drinks.  She noted that she did very well but didn't have enough stock.  In time, bit by bit, she invested more.  Currently, she continues with the same business and she is well-known by her customers who are the same workers and persons who come to take care of paperwork at city hall.  With this 1,000 sol loan she will buy more soft-drinks in various flavors, sizes and brands as well as mineral water, both sparkling and still.  Mar\u00eda Silvia has many goals before her and she feels motivated to see them come to fruition.  She is very grateful to the Manuela Ramos Movement for helping her when she most needed help.

They are conscious that everything they do is for the benefit of their daughter.  They love her, and would do everything necessary for her, as the career she has chosen generates a great deal of expenses.\r\n\r\nF\u00e1tima\u2019s dream is to see her daughter become fulfilled in every aspect.  For that reason, she doesn\u2019t mind any sacrifices she may have to make to realize this goal.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":556861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase purses and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatima Del Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":275.01,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":275.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632935},{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":275.01,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":275.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846969},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113429},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407024},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:46Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407025},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388137},{"amount":91.63,"local_amount":91.63,"processed_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:45Z","rounded_local_amount":91.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388138}],"funded_date":"2010-07-16T15:44:40Z","paid_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":212987,"name":"Adwen Pa Trust  Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth describes herself as a hard working woman.

D. L. Llave there is a small community called El Para\u00edso that\u2019s located along the Cordoba-VeraC. highway.

Campo.\u201d  \r\n\r\nJulissa is one of the eleven members of this group.  She is 41 years old and only went to elementary school.  She\u2019s married to Juan, who is a field hand.  Julissa has three children but only the youngest, Pablo, 12, is still dependent on her.  He goes to the local elementary school.\r\n\r\nJulissa tells us that she\u2019s always been a very hard working woman.  When she left school her mother taught her to work doing domestic chores and to prepare Mexican fast food like \u201cchiles rellenos\u201d (stuffed chili peppers) and tamales which has been very useful for her because since she got married she has been selling food on weekends to earn a little extra money to help her husband with household expenses.  She sells her snacks among friends and neighbors in the community.  First, she makes the tamales and the chiles and when they are ready she places them in buckets and goes out door to door selling them.  Thanks to God, she always sells out everything.  Besides selling fast food snacks, Julissa also sells beef and pork on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.  She needs this loan to buy meat, chilies, eggs, tomatoes, onion, corn, firewood, banana leaves, oil and plastic bags.  She tells us that sales have helped her a lot because bit by bit she\u2019s helped her husband build a house out of substantial materials and she hopes to use her profits to continue with the construction because she wants to have something to leave her children and that they not want for anything.\r\n\r\nThe other ten members are:\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda \u2013 grocery sales\r\n\r\nAlejandro- shoe sales\r\n\r\nGalvina \u2013 stationery sales\r\n\r\nAlberta-clothing sales\r\n\r\nRosa-shoe sales\r\n\r\nJuana-clothing sales\r\n\r\nJuana B.- grocery sales\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Cristina-bread sales\r\n\r\nEsteban-bread sales\r\n\r\nTomasa-grocery sales\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":810303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to make tamales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Paraiso escondido","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-07-14T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3875,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Galdina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Julissa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esteban ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1162.5,"local_amount":13500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":13512.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223515},{"amount":1259.38,"local_amount":14625,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":14638.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201796},{"amount":1453.12,"local_amount":16875,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:30Z","rounded_local_amount":16891.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807386}],"funded_date":"2011-07-15T19:21:36Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":319532,"name":"Gueume  Yalla Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe de solidarit\u00e9 Gueume Yalla est cr\u00e9\u00e9 le 29 d\u00e9cembre 2010, il est constitu\u00e9 de dix sept femmes qui sont amies, voisines et qui s'entendent bien, elles font du commerce et de l'\u00e9levage.\n\n\nMadame Diary la responsable est mari\u00e9e m\u00e8re de quatre enfants, elle a en charge son neveu, est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 49 ans et est restauratrice avec une bonne exp\u00e9rience; elle fait aussi de l'embouche ovine.

Justine is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kayunga in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is married and has one child. For the past year, Justine has been working hard to manage her food stall which sells fruits and vegetables. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Justine has requested a loan of 250,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more fruits and vegetables and will help Justine to generate greater profits and buy new clothes for herself. Justine hopes that in the future she will be able to open up her own retail shop. \r\n\r\nJustine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Justine's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit, and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan, she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from getting diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. \n\nLydia believes that through this loan, her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production.

from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! This is 28 year-old Neema S.. She is married with two children, ages one and thirteen.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007, Neema established a grocery store business. She works seven days a week from nine to twelve hours a day and is assisted by her husband. She has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA. She requires a new loan to purchase additional stock of rice, oil, biscuits, butter, and nuts in bulk. In the future, Neema also plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>About SELFINA<br>\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing.

Almost six months ago, her husband abandoned her. As a result, she is completely dedicating herself to her work and to her small children for whom she had decided to work more. Carmen works as a cook at \"Pancho Pollo\" in the mornings and, in the evenings, she is dedicated to selling barbecue, empanadas, sodas and other items. She does not have a lot of competition since she sells on the corner of Alemana Avenue and ER Anillo.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

When she was able to gather a little money she began selling clothing accessories to her girlfriends and little by little began to amass a bit of capital which she then invested in the purchase of clothing.  She feels satisfied because, with her business, from a very early age, she was able to help support her parents, buy her items, and help her husband with the expense of educating their children thereby insuring that they would have a profession.  Today, her work's purpose is to support her youngest child who is a university student and, when she travels to the countryside where she also sells her merchandise, she takes advantage of the opportunity to get to know a bit more of her country.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":411977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessica Marilu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lily Mabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlene Eliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lisbeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela Yesenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6350,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1058.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1058.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1058.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1058.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1058.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1058.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":370.83,"local_amount":1058.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1060.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780212},{"amount":371.3,"local_amount":1059.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1061.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669081},{"amount":371.07,"local_amount":1059,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1061.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064539},{"amount":370.72,"local_amount":1058,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1060.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899604},{"amount":370.37,"local_amount":1057,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1059.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933694},{"amount":370.71,"local_amount":1058,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1060.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661315}],"funded_date":"2009-11-27T21:41:10Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":150818,"name":"Colombe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Colombe M. is 26 years old and single.

They are the motivation for all of her efforts.\r\n<p>\r\nSarita works growing carrots, potatoes, peas, and other crops.  She does this work together with her husband, who also works hard to provide their children with a good education.  She has seen it to be convenient to sell her crops in Bolivia, since it is obvious that she has better earnings there.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is preventing her crops from pests that can threaten her productivity, cleaning and spraying her plants.  She has been in this business for 15 years and she considers the most difficult part to be transporting her crops, since the road is very long and tiring.  With time, she hopes that her crops improve and with the increase in sales, she can improve her economic earnings.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Sarita\u2019s ninth loan with MFP and she feels an obligation to make her loan repayments on time, since she does not want to cause problems for the other members of her communal bank, where she is very well-liked.

They are the motivation behind all of her daily efforts in life.  Mady has a beauty salon where she offers personal and professional image makeover services for women, men, and children.  She provides haircuts, hair treatments, pedicures, manicures, and even product application advice.  For many years, Mady lived in the neighboring country of Venezuela but returned five years ago to Colombia to start her business venture.  Today her business has grown and has now become her life\u2019s project.  Her reception in the marketplace has been very good.  Mady acquired two display cases for her business where she stores the products that she uses and recommends.  Even though her customer base is growing, she has insufficient operating capital to keep up with demand.  \n\nFor this reason she has requested a Kiva loan to buy beauty supplies such as shampoos, massagers, dyes, and other hair care products in bulk to use in her salon and to sell to customers who have ordered them.  Mady hopes that this will be a successful investment.  Her goal moving forward is to hire a new employee and make a few structural changes so that her salon will be a comfortable place for her customers and attract more business.  In the meantime, she manages a profit margin of no less than 70% and an inventory turnover period of 15 days.  These indicators signal her potential for growth.

Before joining One Acre Fund, Mercy was only able to harvest four bags of maize on half an acre of land.\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Mercy and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit, and insurance.\r\nWith income from maize sales, Mercy will educate her children, ensure food security, and invest in livestock rearing. In 2012, the members of Talangi Group will each plant between half and one acre of maize.\r\nIn the photograph, the field officer is pictured standing on the far left."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":893167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felistas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":49000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":364657,"name":"Lourdes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201dHUCHUY QOSQO\u201d; El banco comunal se encuentra ubicado en el distrito de Lamay en la provincia de Calca y departamento de Cusco.\nLa socia es la Sra.

Recently he began to invest, and with great persistence, his beef is now of top quality and his hard work is paying off. Now he has decided to formally start his own cattle business that, even though small, has excellent production of dairy products, and he hopes to successfully continue with such excellent performance. <p> Since his parents' health has declined in the last two years, Henri has become responsible for supporting his family. He uses all of his earnings for their health expenses, hoping that they will get better. To meet his goals, he is asking for a loan of $550 USD to buy the products necessary to allow him better productivity.
