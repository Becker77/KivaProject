Marcosa and James work hard to cover their daily expenses and put their children through school.  For the past five years Marcosa has been running a Sari-sari or general store in the market, which has provided earnings of 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month. \r\n\r\nMarcosa would like to expand her store and increase her inventory, and has applied for a loan of 8,000 PHP to purchase soft drinks, meats, and dried fish.  She hopes the additional goods will allow her to generate more revenue and income.  \r\n\r\nMarcosa has been a member of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) since 2008 and has consistently attended weekly fellowship meetings.  She hopes she will eventually have a prosperous business.\r\n\r\nAbout CCT:\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical missionary work in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.

A year and a half ago, Andrea became a certified Zumba instructor, prompting her to leave her career as a flight attendant and begin teaching classes herself.\n\nShe opened Intone Dance Studio on April 1, 2011.  In addition to Andrea, the studio has three instructors who all individually teach classes, allowing Andrea to offer classes throughout the morning and afternoon.  Many of her current students are people who followed her from the studio where she previously worked.  The students help Andrea grow the studio by recruiting friends and bringing them to class.  Though anyone can join, the majority of Andrea\u2019s students are young and middle-aged women.  \n\nAndrea is using this loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana to help cover initial operating costs and meet any unforeseen expenses.  She hopes to save enough of the money from this loan to upgrade the studio\u2019s sound system once the business gets through the first few startup months.  For supplemental income, Andrea rents out the studio for special events such as baby showers.\n\nAndrea loves seeing the physical and mental transformation her students undergo as they take her classes.  She hopes to eventually expand her studio and carry workout apparel.  Andrea likes owning her own business, despite finding it stressful.  \u201cBeing your own boss is good because you can organize your time the way you want it.  But at the same time, it brings a lot of responsibility\u2026it is a challenge.\u201d  Andrea is married with a 16-year-old

She lives with her husband and children in a large traditional family in the city of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). \r\n\r\nHaving attempted several activities without success, Salimata became involved in the storage and sale of grain (maize, millet, sorghum, etc.) over seven years ago. She has her own shop in Kabo\u00efla I.\r\n\r\nEager to better serve her growing customer base, she joined the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso about six years ago. After five group loans in collaboration with a local women\u2019s group (the Kotognogontala Association of Banconi), she is now seeking her eighth individual loan. All previous loans were repaid without problems. \r\n\r\nWith this new loan, she plans to purchase 25 sacks of maize, 15 sacks of millet and 15 sacks of sorghum. She buys her stock in various communities surrounding Sikasso, and then sells the merchandise wholesale or at retail to a clientele consisting mostly of household heads.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will help her earn a monthly profit of 275,000 FCFA, which she will use primarily to increase her working capital, help with the household expenses, and pay the interest on the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":884699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to stock up on grain for resale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-10-06T00:03:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:04Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699275},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655551},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874343},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283164},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424673},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139939},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-19T08:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276756928},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:10Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251705},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.52,"processed_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410751}],"funded_date":"2011-10-11T22:17:02Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":345912,"name":"Nidal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nidal is a 42-year-old single woman from Lebanon.

She is very concientious with her customers and thanks to the flavor and variety of the dishes, she has been able to attract a loyal public.\r\nLinda has had this profitable business for the past 2 years.  Thanks to her effort she has been able to get her children ahead.  The 2 oldest are studying at the university but they still help her in the restaurant.\r\nAs a woman thinking ahead, she would like to enlarge her space a few years from now, and add more tables.  Not only making the food on the menu, but also because of  the late hours, Linda needs a lot of help.  This will be the first time that Linda has applied for a loan with MFP, and that is why she promises to make all the monthly payments on time.  She feels very good with the newly formed communal bank that she hopes will show progress.  She will use the money to buy glass for the tables, new tablecloths, have a plumber fix her dishwasher, paint the walls, and if there is any money left, she will buy drinks.

Several work as laborer has been tried, however the income was not enough to support ever increasing family needs. Finally Komang Muriada follows his parents footsteps to work as a farmer. He works on the 40 are (about 4000 square meters) land owned by his parents with Dinari's loan. Komang Muriada started this new work since last year. As with othe farmers in his village, Komang Muriada also plants long bean vegetables on the land. From working the land, planting seeds, fertilized it, to spraying was done by Komang Muriada himself. During harvest time Komang Muriada is getting help from his wife and 2 daily laborers at a rate of Rp20,000 (about US$2.20)\/day. In one plucking day harvest, Komang Muriada could make about 100 bunches (about 1 kg\/bunch), which he sold for Rp2500-Rp3000 (about 30-35 cents). This was done once every two days. Long beans could be pluck about 25-30X per period (3 months).  Within a period Komang Muriada could produce about Rp 6,000,000 (about US$660) in income. After subtracting Expenses for fertilizers, pesticides, labor cost, etc his net profit is Rp2,050,000 (about US$220)\/ 3 months. This makes Komang Muriada more enthusiastic in doing his work.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDengan hanya memiliki Ijazah SMP dan ketrampilan yang pas-pasan,  tak cukup bagi I Komang Muriada untuk mendapatkan pekerjaan di lembaga formal maupun perusahaan swasta. Apalagi semenjak menikah dengan Putu Putri Ariani, tanggung jawabnya semakin bertambah  karena harus menghidupi istri dan dua orang anak.Untuk itu Komang Muriada harus berusaha keras untuk mendapatkan penghasilan yang menunjang kelangsungan hidup keluarga. Berbagai  pekerjaan sebagai buruh sudah di cobanya, namun hasilnya tak cukup untuk memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya yang semakin meningkat. Sehingga akhirnya Komang Muriada harus mengikuti jejak orang tuanya terjun sebagai petani . Menggarap tanah seluas 40 Are milik orang tua dan dengan  modal pinjaman dari Dinari, Komang Muriada memulai  menekuni pekerjaan barunya sejak tahun lalu . Seperti halnya petani lain di desanya Komang muriada juga menanami tanah garapannya dengan tanaman sayuran yaitu kacang panjang. Dari mengolah tanah,  menanam bibit , memupuk dan menyemprot di kerjakan Komang Muriada sendiri . Sedangkan pada waktu musim panen Komang Muriada di bantu oleh istri dan juga ada dua orang tenaga buruh yang di bayar harian sebesar Rp 20.000,-  . Dalam sekali petik hasil panen, Komang Muriada bisa mencapai 100 ikat ( beratnya kurang lebih 1 kg) , yang per ikat nya di jual Rp. 2.500,- s\/d Rp. 3.000.,-  Itu dilakukan tiap dua hari sekali . Tanaman kacang panjang bisa dipanen sebanyak 20 s\/d 25 kali dalam satu periode ( 3 Bulan ) Dalam satu periode Komang Muriada mendapat hasil produksi sebesar Rp. 6.000.000,-   dan keuntungan yang di peroleh setelah di potong biaya bibit, pupuk , obat-obatan , ongkos buruh dan lain-lain  adalah sebesar Rp.  2.050.000,- \/ tiga bulan . Hasil ini membuat  Komang Muriada semakin semangat untuk menekuni pekerjaannya itu."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":75623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy long bean seeds, fertilizer, pesticides and maintenance upkeep\r\n<p>Membeli bibit kacang panjang, pupuk, obat - obatan dan biaya perawatan","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-16T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"I Komang Muriada","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-31T04:30:31Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-11-05T01:29:05Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":76340},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T02:50:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88547},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T02:47:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100341},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:35:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119146},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T01:18:05Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139733},{"amount":65,"local_amount":65,"processed_date":"2008-03-26T06:10:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166037}],"funded_date":"2007-10-17T04:30:31Z","paid_date":"2008-03-26T06:10:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":25453,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is a small entrepreneur owning a pharmacy shop.

The majority run commercial enterprises from their own homes where they sell groceries or clothing or chupas (a chewy bread snack). They are all neighbours and are now in the third cycle of the women\u2019s program. Each person receives an average of G.600.000 of credit.<p>\r\n\r\nThe formation of the group was largely due to the efforts of Sra. Gasparina P. who invited her neighbours to participate. They soon became interested in the women\u2019s program and so began the first meetings. The group\u2019s objective currently is the activities associated with the San Juan festival where they plan to sell local dishes and use the money they earn to add to their own savings.<p>\r\n\r\nOne of the characteristics of the members of this group is the high level of observance of the rules that govern the program. This is demonstrated by the regular repayment of the loan and by punctual attendance at the weekly meetings. They are also very strict about members who miss meetings without good reason, and the guilty are given warnings.<p>\r\n\r\nGasparina notes that the success of an undertaking is due in large part to good organisation and discipline. For these reasons she is very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya which, as well as helping the group raise capital, also provides an advisor to assist with training and the administrative tools necessary to run a group business.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer.<b\/><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEl comit\u00e9 est\u00e1 compuesto por 15 se\u00f1oras trabajadoras de la compa\u00f1\u00eda Yaka Roysa de la ciudad de Caacup\u00e9, gran parte de las se\u00f1oras se dedican a actividades comerciales que lo explotan en su mismo domicilio, como  despensas, chiperas, vendedoras de ropas, entre otras, todas son vecinas, actualmente y est\u00e1n en el 3 ciclo del programa comit\u00e9 de mujeres y reciben un promedio de G. 600.000 por persona en cr\u00e9dito.<p>\r\n\r\nLa  conformaci\u00f3n del grupo se debi\u00f3 a la gran colaboraci\u00f3n que brindo la se\u00f1ora Gasparina P., quien fue la que comenz\u00f3 inicialmente con las invitaciones a sus vecinas quienes r\u00e1pidamente mostraron inter\u00e9s por el programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres.

He lives with his wife and his son in a house he owns.  He offers internet access to the public.  Because he is close to a school, most of his customers are children and young people who attend the school.  He has had this business for two years: he manages and attends to his business alone.  What he likes best about his work is interacting with the young people who ask for his help.  The business is very profitable because he has loyal customers and his internet stations are always busy.

She is married with six children all between the ages of 13 and 18 \r\n<p>\r\nSalimiti has run a poultry business since 2003.  Raising Kuku (chicken in Swahili) is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients.  They require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally!  They require little space, so you can just let them run around in your garden or compound.  While they grow they produce eggs, which can be sold to supplement her income or eaten to provide a source of protein.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe works at the business 12 hours a day, seven days per week and is assisted by one employee.  Salimiti earns about $140 from her business.  She requests a loan of $400 to purchase more chickens. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Salimiti thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\n--------------------------------\r\nABOUT SELFINA\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":336944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-06-16T00:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimiti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:02Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233218},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665011},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105723},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022833},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868074},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757270}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T00:52:49Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Allen","image":1340661}},{"id":119684,"name":"Paula Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Paula Elizabeth R.

Anahaw, Hinigaran Negros Occidental. She is 35 years old and married to Eulogio B., who is presently employed as Kabo (supervisor) in a sugarcane plantation. They have an adopted child, Jasmine, who is eight years old. The couple is still hoping to have their own baby someday. Even though she has a small family, Vivian still prepares for their future. She still helps her husband raise their weekly income. \r\n\r\nThe family has their own small rice farm that supports the food needs of the family. This gave Vivian the idea to make the rice field more productive. In the year 2002 she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to have capital for her farm to buy seeds and fertilizer and to pay for labor. Since the rice is harvested after three months, Vivian worked in the sugarcane plantation in the meantime. After harvesting the rice, she had it milled and sold it to the people in her community and also to the sugarcane workers. The rice business earns an average of PHP 4,000 per month, which is enough for her small family, with savings left for their future security.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of Php 17,000 was used as working capital for her farm. She paid all of her weekly installments on time and the loan was fully paid within the loan term, maintaining her status as a good member of NWTF_Project Dungganon. Now she is borrowing Php 19,000 to add to her capital for her rice farm to have a better living standard in the future.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

She runs her business out of her home and sells sweets, bread and other food items like fruit juice.  This will be her fourth loan with Esperanza after successfully paying back her previous three loans.  She plans to use this loan to purchase food items to sell and ingredients so she can make items to sell.  She specifically needs flour, rice, sugar, oil, eggs and butter.  \r\n\r\nMaria wants to continue to improve her living conditions by working hard and advancing her family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing general alteration and tailoring services to community members for clothing such as dresses and school uniforms. Leah has been engaged in her business for more than 4 years and earns approximately 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month for these activities. The picture above was taken outside her house where a garden of flowers is located.\r\n\r\nLeah joined HSPFI in 2010 to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase tailoring equipment such as needles and thread. Leah is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fabrics and other materials. This will be her second loan from HSPFI. Leah plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and\/or expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHagdan sa Pag-uswag Foundation, Inc.

With the blows life was giving her at that time, and in a foreign country, she saw the necessity of returning to Paraguay, to start all over again from zero.\r\n\r\n<p>She started out selling merchandise in the street. At that time she had just one big bag which she carried on her back, going from house to house offering her products. In this way she made working capital and, little by little, with much sacrifice, her business kept growing. She had the chance to buy a new house and in that way raise her 5 children and offer them a good education. Today, she already has a good quantity of customers, and thanks to her effort and the support of her children, she is able to open a small business inside her own home.\r\n\r\n<p>With the loan she is requesting, she plans to expand her stock of merchandise.

She also says that she has grown a lot, but now with the rise in prices it is more difficult to sell fish, because before with the capital she had she was able to buy tons of fish and now she can only buy kilos so this is her greatest challenge.\r\n\r\nWith this loan for S\/.3,000, which will be repaid in 6 months, she will buy specifically with this entire loan, fish, because she tells us that each case costs S\/.96 and it is necessary to invest a lot.\r\n\r\nRaquiel mentions that she would like to educates herself to improve her business and also her personal life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":226413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Yungay - Ancash","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.166667 -77.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:46Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquiel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":502.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951795},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":502.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224841},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:43:20Z","rounded_local_amount":502.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417563},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":502.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111009},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":502.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006331},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":502.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590219}],"funded_date":"2008-12-24T07:39:54Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:39:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":78740,"name":"Mustafokul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S.

She is a 53-year-old married mother of two children, both grown up. Out of the need to make headway for her children and thanks to her enterprising spirit and energy, she decided to start her own business selling food in a well-conditioned space out of her home, where she also provides a boardinghouse. Lisbith tells us that she started with 200 soles of capital and little by little she saved and it grew each day. She wakes up very early to prepare her meals. She tends to her boarders with the charisma and tasty foods she is known for. With this loan of 1,000 soles, she plans to set up a small kitchen area where she can make her meals and also purchase cooking utensils to provide better service. She plans to use part of the money to purchase rice, sugar and other products of primary need. Lisbith feels very safe and has a strong desire to keep moving forward to assure herself of a peaceful life.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

All of the women work at making and selling chipas [a traditional cheese bread] on a large scale. All of them work in their own homes making the products and later they go out to various points of the city of Asuncion to sell them. \r\n\r\nPreviously, the women's committee program worked commercially but in a smaller scale. That is why these days, with the formation of the business women's committee, there is an attitude of belonging from keeping up with the requirements that the committee makes of them.  \r\n\r\nOne of the women is Miguela, who, with the help of her whole family, makes her delicious chipas every day starting very early, since she has to deliver the orders to the resalers. With her her family, she works very hard. She wants very much to get ahead, especially since her children are studying for their professions. In this way she is improving her income and her quality of life.  She is asking for this loan to purchase ingredients to make her product, such as starch, cheese, oil, squash and others. \r\n\r\nThe loan will facilitate the work and increase the capital that each woman has. In this way, they will be able to satisfy their needs, investing in their small businesses that will generate more income for the family unit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4350,"image":{"id":526923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase ingredients for chipas, such as: starch, yucca starch, cheese, squash, and corn meal.

with her husband (who appears in the photo) and their three children, who are between the ages of 6 and 10. She earns a living by selling a variety of merchandise, including cosmetics and clothing. She also has another business selling pork and chicken by the pound, which brings in a good amount of money. Lucy is creative and entrepreneurial and started these businesses to help her husband support the family, which he used to do by himself before she became an independent worker. She started out with just a little money and offers her goods on credit, so she's turning to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to ask for a Kiva loan.

He is the father of two children aged 18 and 20 and he lives together with them and his wife in his own home.  Gerler is about to start a project that he has had in mind for a long time.  He has always wanted to have a restaurant near his home but he currently works in a poultry store.  During all the years that he has worked, he has always saved up so that he can eventually achieve his goal.  However, he is still lacking some money.  He and his wife will start working together selling fried chicken from a small stall on the corner outside their home.  He hopes to be able to achieve big things in this new business. \r\n\r\nThis will be Gerler's first loan from MFP and he is certain that he will be able to make his repayments without problems.  He will use the sum he has requested to buy a stove and some utensils so that he can start work in his own business that he has wished for for so long."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":865210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a stove and utensils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T12:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gesler ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":146.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":156.41},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":161.32},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":171.53},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":177.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":186.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.49},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.32},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.03,"local_amount":146.75,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:06Z","rounded_local_amount":150.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851271},{"amount":58.66,"local_amount":156.41,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666454},{"amount":60.49,"local_amount":161.32,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":165.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621606},{"amount":64.32,"local_amount":171.53,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":175.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835689},{"amount":136.5,"local_amount":363.99,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":372.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203184}],"funded_date":"2011-09-29T11:41:51Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":337738,"name":"Rosario","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosario is 64 years old and lives in P-1 Embargo, Ozamiz City.

Out of the proceeds of his business, he could solve his numerous problems. He could send his children to school, attend to them when they are sick, feed and clothe them. Martin faces some few challenges in his business, like the lack of transportation for the timbers to the main roads, and enough capital to employ a larger labor force. Nevertheless, with the numerous loans he got from SMT, Martin has been able to buy himself a plot of land for the future construction of a house.\r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are now receiving loans from SMT as individual clients, while these two still remain together as a group. They have been with SMT for over 5 years now. These SMT loans are a great help to these entrepreneurs. These people's businesses have been growing as a result of the continuous access to loans they have been getting from SMT. But they still need new loans as it is the continuous access to financial services that can eradicate or reduce poverty.

Bendoline has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $225 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Bendoline joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Bendoline is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in her business. This will be her 2nd loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Yvette sources her goods from Dantokpa, Benin's international market, and has been in this line of work for around ten years. She has already received four loans which have all been successfully repaid. In light of rapid growth in her customer base, Yvette wishes to boost her business proposition and better satisfy those customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva

His business is doing well, particularly since profits associated with his first loan cycle allowed him to build a \"wood and mud\" two-bedroom house with a veranda. Horacio is now requesting a loan of $775 to open a store in the semi-commercial neighborhood of Chiquelene, where more people will be able to appreciate and buy the shoes he makes. Part of the money will also go toward hiring one employee to help him run the business. According to Horacio, joining the credit program has brought many positive changes to his and his family's lives.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Aline Pereira, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nHoracio nao casou oficialmente, mas vive com uma mulher com quem tem 2 filhos.

Do\u00f1a Lucia used to work in agriculture, preparing fields with slash and burn methods, which was a very risky job for her as a women. Thanks to her efforts she was able to leave that and begin a small business selling snow cones. With her service attitude, later on she was able to set up a business buying and selling traditional regional clothing. Her clientele increases every day and she has made improvements to her standard of living, perhaps not by 100 percent, but every day her goal is to become better and be responsible so that both her business and her income improves.

His wife, Mrs. Seng Thorn, helps him on the plantation. The couple has five children, all of whom are attending the local school. \r\n<p>\r\nThis group loan has end-of-term loans so all the members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She has been through junior high school.  Hagah prepares 'kenkey' (maize dough) for sale at Abura. Hagah uses the income she generates from the sale of her 'kenkey' to pay her utility bills and accommodation.  Hagah will use the loan to purchase additional bags of maize to prepare 'kenkey' for sale. With the new profits from her extended business, Hagah plans to reinvest into her business.\r\n\r\nTo prepare her 'kenkey' she buys maize from the market and soaks it in enough water to soften the maize. She washes it on the third day and sends it to the mill to be milled. She then makes a mixture of dough out of the milled wet corn and leaves it to prove on the next day.\r\n\r\nShe divides the proved dough into two, uses one for her firm half-cooked dough (mixes it with water to make a porridge, cooks it for some time to get a firm mixture or texture of the dough) and mixes the rest of the uncooked one with the half cooked. She moulds it into balls and wraps them in corn husk.

Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: selling  E-LOAD (electronic reloading service to prepaid cellular phone users) and selling firewood. \r\n\r\nRonalet joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ronalet has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 17,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $138, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more prepaid cellular phone service E-load and more firewood to resell so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. Ronalet J. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is a farmer in Ahovil\u00e8kom\u00e8 village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and he is a member of the Houedome group GH AYIDOTE MINAWANOU. The inhabitants of this village farm the land after the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river drops. Their lands are rich and highly productive. Their main business activities involve growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these river valley dwellers is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and they spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. At low water they don\u2019t have any money left to pay the workforce that is essential for sowing the land available to them. The local practice of selling off the harvested crops does not provide them with security, moreover, it bankrupts them. This practice involves selling the future harvest at a rock-bottom price to an affluent person to get hold of the money required to carry out the farming. Tired of this practice, they have asked for a loan of 100,000 FCFA ($200) to farm about one hectare of the aforementioned land<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":237216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To farm one hectare of corn and peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-10T17:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jean","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821541},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357807},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046857},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938475},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396141},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":25800.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904018},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-20T07:44:14Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126026}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T05:06:51Z","paid_date":"2009-08-20T07:44:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":82884,"name":"Latif","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Latif S. is a 43-year-old married man who lives with his daughter and owns a small farm. He lives and works in the small village of Penjikent, Tajikistan. Latif has a business raising and selling sheep. He has 5 years of experience in this field. \r\n\r\nBecause sheep raising and selling is a profitable business, Latif has become a very successful businessman in a very short period of time. He works very hard and spends all his time with the sheep; cleaning, feeding and pasturing them. \r\n\r\nNow, Latif wants to expand his business and buy more sheep, so he has applied for a loan of 2000 Somoni ($600 USD). He promises to repay the loan within 12 months and thanks all lenders for their support. With your help, Latif can get ahead.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She sells snack food for the neighbors just to augment her farmer husband's sporadic income. Two months ago, she decided to open a small variety store in their house. Business capital she had then came from her only child who is a laborer. This is the only child she had living with her after five other children got married and moved to their own houses nearby. Though Melba has able to maintain her small variety store, the capital she had was not enough to fill up her store with basic items and products which people in the village need. Now that she is a member of ASHI, she has applied for a loan which will complete her variety store. She hopes that with this loan she will be able to sell more necessary items in her store for the convenience of her neighbors.

She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.    Sitoe needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sitoe joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Sitoe's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score for Sitoe A. provided by SPBD:*               1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3 \r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She regularly attends the weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow nine times in CCT\u2019s cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed solely to buy assorted electronic gadgets.  Her business lets her earn a profit of PHP 17,400 per month.\r\n\r\nNow, with your help, Eliza would like to apply for a PHP 20,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying more electronic gadgets and appliances.\r\n\r\nEliza dreams that her business will continue to grow so that her family will have better living conditions in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance
