The bank has the name of the community where all of its members live.  Totorilla is a small valley where most of the population dedicates themselves to agriculture. Their lands produce coriander, spinach, cabbage, lettuce, and alfalfa. They are also dedicated to raise small farm animals and cattle in small proportion.<\/p>\r\n<p>The members do different activities like mototaxi service, agriculture, raising farm animals and selling groceries, fruits, propane gas and beverages.  In Yolanda's, Olga\"s and Pecina's case they work in the agricultural fields; something that they learned since young and presently they work together with their husbands. They cultivate spinach, coriander, cabbage, lettuce and alfalfa and also raise small farm animals and cattle in small proportion.  They sell their own products at wholesale and retail in a local public market named Nery G. Zarate.<\/p>\r\n<p>The members need loans in different amounts, some amounts are 300 soles(Peruvian currency), 600 soles, 900 soles being a total of 8600 soles in loans for the Totorilla Community Bank.  The money will be invested in buying seeds,fertilizers, rice, sugar, noodles, milk, propane gas, tires for a motorcycle and also to buy  \"cuy\" ( a typical Peruvian animal) to be raised.\r\nThe members are also learning parenting skills, how to raise, feed, and educate their children, and how to be responsible citizens.

The president of the bank is a person of strong character, cheerful and proactive who, with his sister, forms part of the bank.  He has a son who is school-aged.  Senora Missel, treasurer, is a go-getter and a determined person who has a minor child who is a year old.  Sandra Elizabeth, secretary of the bank, is a person who is very determined and proactive, and the other members of the bank have similar personalities.  The president, Alberto, makes sporting clothes.  Senora Missel sells cellular phones in a market in the city.  Sandra sells office supplies (scotch tape, etc.) wholesale, which she distributes in the different markets in the city.  Other members sell food from their homes and another member repairs cell phones and computers.  While there are other similar businesses in the area where they are developing their activities, the affluence of the consumers in the markets and the constant urban growth makes it such that the activities that they are developing are not affected.

Then he used a loan to set up a small business selling replacement parts.  Through the years he has been able to invest in it.  He has customers, but he frequently gives them credit.  Months pass before they are completely paid.  Sales are down in his business.  This is all due to the bad economy, which has covered the country.

Shermat is a hard-working man who is in agriculture. He has worked at this business for a long time and acquired his abilities in ranching and farming when he was very young. He is a married father with responsibilities for supporting his three children.\r\n\r\nShermat is known as being very responsible and hard-working since, every day, very early in the morning, he starts his job taking care of his fields while at the same time raising cattle in his own pen located at his house.\r\n\r\nIMON International has been the backbone of Shermat\u2019s business because of having granted loans which have allowed him to improve his standard of living through the acquisition of cattle and vegetables for planting. Today, once again, Shermat trusts that his credit will be approved so that he will be able to improve his business with the purchase of cattle and also farm supplies.\r\n          \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They have one son: 8 year-old Gerson.  The three of them live together as a family in their own home which is located in the town of Ricrican.  Blas grows potatoes, olluco (a native tuber) and mashua (a native tuber).  They are his main crops.  What Blas most likes about his work is going out every morning, together with his radio.  To the rhythm of his music he cares for, irrigates and applies manure to his crops.  He says that the land is his life.\r\n\r\nSince he was a young boy, Blas grew up learning farming techniques.  For this reason, every harvest is a symbol of his perseverance and the good care that he takes of his land.  In his town's wholesale market he sells not only the crops which he grows but also the meat from the lambs that he raises.  However, unlike other residents, he also sells the wool from these animals which is very thick and helps protect people from the cold.\r\n\r\nBlas would like to buy a truck which would allow him to travel more easily.  This is his seventh loan with MFP.  He comments, very happily, that thanks to the support of his community bank, he has been able to get ahead in life.  He will use his loan to buy several sacks of organic fertilizer which he will spread on his crops.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":664330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy several sacks of organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-14T00:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2048.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349904}],"funded_date":"2010-12-15T23:20:19Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":261805,"name":"Tek","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tek R. is a married woman who earns a living by planting rice in the Kompong Tom Province.

Three of these children are under fifteen years of age. He lives with his family in a two-bedroom apartment in Bamenda, North West Region of Cameroon. The major challenges he has faced in life have been the death of his father, the failure of his son in the ordinary-level Government Certificate Exams, the difficulty to pay his children\u2019s school fees and the sudden death of two of his pigs.\r\n \r\nHe joined GHAPE in 2009. He invested his last loan in his pig business and used the proceeds to educate his children and to buy zinc and nails to complete his house. He plans to invest this loan in his electronics shop, to buy cables, bulbs and plugs. He believes that this business will be successful because he is selling very good quality cables and other materials that his customers will like.\r\n\r\nWith the proceeds from this loan, he will pay his children\u2019s school fees and furnish his house. He prefers a GHAPE loan because of the low interest rates, the education GHAPE offers its members, and because the loan is repaid in payments.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community in its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its

is married with three young children in primary school. He has no formal training, having left school at an early age because his family could not pay the fees. He comes from a humble peasant family from the central part of Kenya. He started a small business selling new clothes at the border (Malaba) and has been able to slowly grow. He received his first loan from PEMCI to expand his retail shop and he successfully repaid the loan. <p>\r\n\r\nWith this second loan he plans to expand his shop into both a retail and wholesale outlet. He also intends to diversify by offering cosmetic products. With continuously increasing capital, he plans to purchase stock directly from the factory. This will reduce his expense and he will be able to become a supplier in the area. <p>\r\n\r\nWith his business, Peter is able to provide clothing to the community at an affordable price. He has also been able to bring products closer to other small business people. This enables them to save on transportation costs of having to go to the city for restocking.

She is an extremely hard working woman and she has to be because she has 4 young children she must take care of. Each child is under the age of 14 and requires a lot of attention and care. Before Sira's first loan she had almost no form of income and found it very difficult to even feed all her young children. With the first loan she started a very small cafeteria. She hopes to use this next loan to add a wider range of products to sell. She is very excited about her cafeteria and finally feels like she is going to be able to support her children and give them a better life. She is excited to finally have something of her own and she knows she will be a success someday!\n\nThanks for all your

She sells food like empanadas and \u201cmilanesas\u201d (breaded and fried veal) among others.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, in order to start this activity, she started selling fast food by setting up a small stand at every Patron Saint Festival in the city.  The success of her food was so great that she used the income it generated to create her store.\r\n\r\nThanks to her entrepreneurial spirit and her good service, she currently has a good customer base, and she continues to prepare foods to sell.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for is to buy a freezer, which she needs to sell very cold drinks. \r\n\r\nHer primary objective is to expand her

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.

","en":"Se\u00f1orita Margarita is 21 years old, and lives in the municipality of San Pedro Sula, in the department of Cortes.  Margarita is a single mother of a four-year-old son.  They both live with Margarita's mother.\r\n\r\nOn weekends, Margarita sells tamales and soup.  She offers a large variety of food for sale, including tamales made from chicken and beef, and different kinds of soup: chicken, beef, winkle and seafood.  To go with the food, she also sells natural juice made from nance (a small yellow fruit from Honduras), blackberry, and other flavors.\r\n\r\nAfter studying at the region's public university, Margarita wasn't able to find work.  Thinking about her son, she decided to sell food so that she could work from home and give more attention to her son.  She has already been doing this work for a year, and she notes that one challenge for her business is when prices of raw ingredients rise, because then she has to increase the price of her products.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of L10,000 to purchase meat, spices, leaves for the tamales, butter and a cooking pot.  Her goal is to expand to have a franchise of businesses.  Her efforts are dedicated to her business, and she hopes that everything will move ahead wonderfully.  She wants to provide her son with well-being and a secure future, and to give him a good education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":913926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase meat, spices, leaves for tamales, butter and a cooking pot.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Pedro Sula, Cort\u00e9s","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":201,"posted_date":"2011-11-13T16:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita Yessill","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":726.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":940.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.97},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.97,"local_amount":726.66,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":757.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250854545},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":868.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257264310},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":868.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263405522},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:47:25Z","rounded_local_amount":868.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270119983},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:49:13Z","rounded_local_amount":868.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276737044},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:53:41Z","rounded_local_amount":868.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283227491},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":868.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287376356},{"amount":235.03,"local_amount":4273.36,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4453.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294637016}],"funded_date":"2011-11-14T03:11:31Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T09:09:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":360205,"name":"Franco","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Franco is a married man with three school aged children.

on November 9, 1966 in Cotonou in Littoral County,  Ms. Bertille A. is married and the mother of two children, who are both in school.  Her husband  Eustache HOUNDJO is an accountant who lost his job several months ago.  Ms.  Bertille A. is a seamstress by training and has been residing in the A\u00cfDJEDO district for eleven years.  For seven years, she has been selling ready-to-eat meals in a private educational complex in her district.  She is also a distributor of various goods, namely damask fabrics, soap, rice, pagne (traditional print cloth), vegetable oil, and other products.  This second business activity that, in the beginning, she used to do only during vacation time, has become something daily, since her husband lost his accountant's job.  She makes her purchases in the Dantokpa marketplace and also in Lom\u00e9 in TOGO.  As a result of financial difficulties tending to handicap improvements in her businesses, she had come to take on an initial loan of 60,000 francs CFA in 2007.  Because of her very fruitful initial experience, she requested and obtained her second loan, which she repaid successfully.  She comes now to request a third loan of 150,000 francs CFA for the purposes of meeting her customers' expectations.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva volunteer<b><p>\r\nN\u00e9e le 09\/11\/1966 \u00e0 Cotonou dans le d\u00e9partement du Littoral, dame A.

He has always worked in agriculture, and since his marriage, he has put his experience to work in the fields so that he and his wife might achieve well being in their family. Thanks to their hard work their children are now independent with families of their own. Now, the couple works to support each other. Their jobs take up most of their time every day, and require plenty of hard work, but they enjoy it. They are especially proud of their product, which they care for by purchasing manure and fertilizer which help them to grow their crops successfully. The cost of these necessary items, however, is very hight. Dario must care for his wife every day, and this is his main motivation to work hard.

She is divorced and has two children who are 14 and 16 years old. She has been a member of the Yoff savings bank which belongs to U-IMCEC (a mutual loan and savings union) since October 2009. Mrs K.'s specialises primarily in sewing and trading. She ventured into sewing as early as 1973 when she abandoned her studies. Her mother strongly encouraged her in her sewing activity. What pleases her most is the progress she has achieved and also the fabrication of beautiful costumes. Mrs K. has a secondary activity which is the sale of fritters next to her home. She is borrowing 250,000 francs for the acquisition of a second machine. The rest of the money will allow her to buy bags of millet and sugar in order to make the millet-based fritters that she sells. The development of her business and the consequent growth in her profits will allow her to cover her daily expenses and provide financial support for her small family.\r\n\r\nAs part of the ongoing vision to participate actively in the battle against poverty, U-IMCEC, with the backing of its lenders, is successfully supporting people to carry out lucrative revenue-generating activities; this in turn is contributing to a welcome socio-economic development. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":465386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase of working capital and investment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-01-07T11:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007484},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:03Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036556},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759113},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790627},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971067},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708331},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922402},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188905},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:21Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484349},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":25042.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620606}],"funded_date":"2010-01-07T18:03:45Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":171138,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"L.

Four of the children, including two grandchildren, are currently attending school. Paul is a farmer in western Kenya, near the town of Kitale. He has been farming for 46 years and has one employee. His main produce is maize, beans, watermelons, and cabbages, which he sells to the local market. Paul depends mainly on farming to educate the family and meet their needs.\r\n<p>\r\nHe has requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo for 31,200 KES to buy and insure a dairy cow.

To make a living, Genelyn owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Genelyn has been engaged in her business for over 14 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Genelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Genelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Genelyn is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Genelyn from ASKI.

Zarina was accepted into the Architectural University in 2002, where she studied for five years, and in 2007, Zarina returned to her parents in her native village.  In 2008, Zarina got married at the age of 23.  Her first daughter was born a year after that, in 2009, and then another daughter one year later.  In search of a source of income for her family, Zarina and her husband decided to purchase a retail space in the Kainda village in 2010.  Having invested an initial capital, the young family bought out the retail space and purchased a new inventory of merchandise.  At the present time, thanks to Zarina's love of hard work and persistence, her store yields about 12,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further develop her business, Zarina requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to expand the assortment of merchandise.  She plans to invest the profits into refilling her merchandise inventories and updating her retail equipment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":940336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to broaden an assortment of goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Zhayilma village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-13T21:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zarina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":7473},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":7408},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":7599},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7795},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7997},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8203},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8415},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8633},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8856},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9084},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9319},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9218}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.27},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.6},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.41},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.3},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200.36},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":160.67,"local_amount":7473,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":7522.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722537},{"amount":159.27,"local_amount":7408,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7457.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125473},{"amount":163.38,"local_amount":7599,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":7649.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250628},{"amount":167.59,"local_amount":7795,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":7846.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975599},{"amount":171.94,"local_amount":7997,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":8050.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276816176},{"amount":176.36,"local_amount":8203,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:05:55Z","rounded_local_amount":8257.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283072210},{"amount":1150.79,"local_amount":53525,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":53879.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370773}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T14:31:37Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":372511,"name":"Nadia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nadia is a 25-year-old married woman with three children, not in school.

Her husband told her that he had loaned her the items so she had to pay him back.

In addition, they also sell clothing and cups.\r\n<p>In order to keep up with ever-increasing customer demand, the group has decided to get help from the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution, with whom they are on their third solidarity (or group) loan. All of their previous loans have been repaid in full. They are planning to use this loan to purchase 938 kg of fresh fish and 35 cakes of ice. They purchase their fresh fish from the fishermen on-site on the banks of the Niger River in Markala. Some of the fish is sold while it\u2019s fresh and some is smoked in a converted area on the family land in buildings specially designed for this job. The women take the smoked fish to Bamako (the capital of Mali) to be sold to resellers wholesale and for cash. When they return from Bamako they buy clothing and cups that they will sell in the markets of Markala, Niono, and Siribala to a customer base made up of men and women.\r\n<p>They each hope to make an average monthly profit of 40,000 FCFA which will be used to pay the interest on the loan and to take care of their extended family.

Since she got married, she has focused on providing the best care to her husband and their 8 children, most of whom are already married, and now only the last three live with Rosa. To meet the needs of so many people, Rosa had to engage in various activities, and she is now dedicated to selling food. Her job is to prepare food in the morning, and then take it to her customers.  Most of Rosa's clients are masons, so Rosa drives to various construction sites to sell lunches. \r\n\r\nThis is her schedule Monday through Friday, which leaves time in the evening to attend to her home, since some of her children are still small. Lately, however, Rosa has noticed that her household expenses are increasing due to the rising prices of food, but since Rosa has a deal with her customers to charge them at the end of the month, Rosa cannot increase the price of her meals. \r\n\r\nRosa is now carefully expanding her home to install a restaurant inside, because she already has the necessary  furniture, and could then stop moving from one place to another. This is her third loan with MFP, and along with her companions who form her community bank, Rosa works with responsibility in order to not harm her image within the organization.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Since he wife died, he has had to be both a father and a mother for his 3 children whom he treasures.  They live in their own house located in the cental jungle of Peru.

Since then, and for ten years now, he has worked growing plantains, citrus fruits and other crops on his own land as well as on some rented land.   His oldest son helps him in the business, and the work has been good for them both.  Thanks to the business, he and his family are moving forward together.

O. is a tenacious 40 year old woman.  She has three children; 21, 18, and 11 years old.  She lives in the Nueva Jerusal\u00e9n neighborhood in the Soledad-Atl\u00e1ntico municipality.  That is where she has her business of selling varied merchandise directly and through specialized guides.  She also makes food on the week ends and for holidays.\r\n\r\nShe started as a businesswoman because she was a housewife without a life partner.  Even though she had worked previously as an employee, she decided to work on her own.  She did this in order to be able to be close to her children while raising them and to share more time with them.  Bernudis has had various businesses.  In the beginning she sold frozen chicken, and she added a restaurant to this business.  She had to close it because the fixed prices increased, and the customers stopped coming due to the increase in the price of the lunches.\r\n\r\nThat was when, five years ago, she decided to start her food business in her house in the Nuevo Jerusal\u00e9n neighborhood.  She sells \u201challacas\u201d (cornmeal, meat, and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves), pastries, and appetizers on the week ends.  She combines this with her general merchandise sales.  Her profits help her support her family.  She says that being a businesswoman has changed her life.  In addition to giving her independent income, it has given her autonomy and allowed her to buy assets.  She bought a freezer and shelving for her restaurant.\r\n\r\nShe has had four loans with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She is an outstanding client with her punctual payments.  She is currently applying a fifth time for 2,000,000 COP to buy merchandise on order; especially sheets, footwear, and cosmetics.\r\n\r\nHer main goal is to support the education of her children.  Later, when the children have been prepared, she will start a family pharmacy where she will not have to offer credit.  Even though she has learned to select her customers, she must make a greater effort with charged accounts.  Her biggest challenge is making this dream of working in a family pharmacy a reality.  She realizes that you cannot start this business with little money.  Therefore, she needs to work hard and wait a long time.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

His inventories include perfume, clothing, and watches. He has always liked sales and wants to earn extra income. For three years, Ramon has been selling these brand-name items to family, friends, and his growing clientele. He buys his inventory in bulk so that he can resell them at discounted prices. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ramon will be able to buy more inventories. He will be able to reach out to more customers and further expand his business. He supports himself, his wife, and their two children.\r\n\r\nRamon has had two previous loans from ACCION USA, which helped him get his business started. With his third loan, he plans to add to his inventory and increase sales. In the future, he hopes to open a storefront and maintain a stable business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":556047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

He has been in business as a miller for 7 years and has a very good reputation in Bagadadji, his place of work.  His clientele is due to the quality of service he provides.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet customer demand, he has requested help from Soro Yiriwaso to buy a new mill (huller).

Some members only emigrated recently while others--Marie, for example--emigrated several years ago.  They live in a neighborhood of Puerto Plata, a city with an economy that depends on real estate, the country's largest rum factory and the tourist trade (which has taken a beating recently as other tourist areas have become more attractive).  Marie is a single mother with 7 children, 4 of whom still live with her.  She tells us that the greatest danger or challenge for her has been to survive in a strange country because of racism and the other barriers that she faces as an illegal immigrant from another country.  Her favorite activity is going to church to praise the Lord and read the Bible.\r\n\r\nMarie is excited to get this second loan from Esperanza Internacional.  She met the terms for the first loan and has made great strides in growing her business.  She has operated the business for around 10 years.  She started with a small loan from a friend and bought merchandise to resell.  She plans to use the new loan to buy rice, cooking oil, sugar and fruit juices.  The business is called a \"colmado\", a small store that stocks everyday items.  Marie plans to use her earnings to complete the process of applying for residency in the Dominican Republic.  She hopes to be able to return to Haiti to visit her family and help provide for

It's not surprising, then, to find that Mary has her own dressmaking workshop.  She also has a store where she sells handicrafts that is well-known in the region.  Her family includes her husband and 3 children aged 12 to 24 years.  One of her children is in school, and the other 2 are working independently; they have chosen to develop their autonomy in the face of all that life presents them.\r\n\r\nMary started her dressmaking and handicraft businesses 23 years ago.  She learned to sew from her uncle, and perfected her techniques through training at SENA.  She strengthened her business through loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, from which she has received 2 loans.  With this loan from Kiva she will buy handicrafts and supplies for her sewing workshop.  This is a safe investment because she works based on orders from her customers, particularly in the seasons when there is the most tourism in her area.  Mary Luz tells us that the loans have increased her working capital and her profits, which has allowed her to improve her home and buy household goods needed by her family.  Her dream is to keep increasing her profits through disciplined work, so that she can make improvements to her home until it is absolutely beautiful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":760548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She makes them in her small workshop, that she set up in her own house. Every job is ordered in advance by each institution independently. She got started in this business thanks to the fact that her husband is a policeman. This is how she ventured into this line of business, and today she is sought after because of her good workmanship. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this work for more than five years. What she likes about it, is that she can be busy and feel productive. In the future she wants to be a small entrepreneur, and do what she likes to do, which is sewing. What she doesn't like is when she sells on credit and some of her clients are late in paying.  She plans to continue improving her business, expanding the workshop, and hiring staff to help her.\r\n\r\nThis will be the third loan with MFP. She feels good about the work of her communal bank, and wishes to continue having this support.

At 23 years old she already has a business, which she runs with her mother.  She lives with her mother in a rented house and works very hard to improve her economic situation.  It has been three years since Gladis began working hard with her mother.  They sell clothes every weekend at the Sunday market.  She really likes selling clothes, especially to her regular clients.  She is very happy and fun and the clothes that she sells are good quality.  She would like her business to prosper and grow.  The most difficult obstacle is purchasing the clothes.  She prides herself on buying only the best clothes to sell, which has earned her a good reputation and helped to increase her sales.  This is Gladis' first loan with MFP.  She is one of the youngest members of her community bank and has the support of the other members, all of whom would like to see her succeed.  With the money from the loan she will purchase more merchandise, which will cost approximately 500 nuevos soles ($175 USD).\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matthew Raimondi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":271198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To increase her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117056},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:55Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011969},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595554},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989816},{"amount":29.06,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210952},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":96.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640457}],"funded_date":"2009-02-16T12:23:38Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Raimondi","image":549898}},{"id":93032,"name":"Gerardo Eloy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Gerardo M. es un se\u00f1or emprendedor que no quiere que su familia se alarme con esta crisis, si no que el tiempo transcurre y no hay quien lo pare.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She hopes that this mobility will give her an edge and add to her sales.

They own the land that they cultivate, and they also rent other lands to increase their production.  When she harvests the peas and flowers she must select them for their quality and size, but this is a simple process.  After the harvest she must fertilize with compost to avoid being invaded by pests and to generate the most income when the products are brought to market.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Nimia is thinking of buying more land so that she could avoid having to rent land.  This way she could cultivate in larger quantities to obtain higher earnings to help her get ahead.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP, and she is very happy because she likes to work with the other members of her communal bank, who share her desire to succeed.

Justamente para este negocio julia solicita a la fundaci\u00f3n financiamiento por valor de $2.300.000, para comprar mercanc\u00edas como jeans, sabanas, toallas, camisa  de colegios, blusas, a solicitud de los clientes que tiene en diversos barrios de la ciudad. \nJulia desarroll\u00f3 su capacidad emprendedora desde cuando ten\u00eda una tienda con su esposo,  considerado por ella un buen negocio pero muy esclavizante, mon\u00f3tono y no acorde con su estilo de vida, ya que  ella so\u00f1aba con uno diferente, menos rutinario e innovador y donde sus hijas participaran como lo hacen ahora en  Variedades Sandy, por eso siente su actividad actual como su mas grande acierto. Cuando decidieron vender la tienda, se quedaron solo con dos vitrinas  y  un capital que fue  invertido en mercanc\u00edas econ\u00f3micas acorde a su sector objeto;  este negocio empez\u00f3 a funcionar muy bien y fue as\u00ed como a trav\u00e9s de una amiga que le recomend\u00f3 a la   Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  encontr\u00f3  la oportunidad de obtener un capital con bajos intereses, con \u00e9l  compr\u00f3 mercanc\u00eda para ampliar su negocio; su primer cr\u00e9dito fue en grupo y por un monto de $300.000; all\u00ed  recibi\u00f3 capacitaci\u00f3n con la cual aprendi\u00f3 el manejo del negocio  para lograr lo que hoy es,   \u201csu sue\u00f1o hecho realidad\u201d   en la actualidad tiene un cr\u00e9dito individual, pero ha recibido 14, con estos financiamientos ha logrado desarrollar su negocio y darle educaci\u00f3n a su hijos que est\u00e1n estudiando en la universidad dise\u00f1o de modas y administraci\u00f3n respectivamente; al mismo tiempo sus hijas trabajan con ella y son el tr\u00edo fant\u00e1stico, cada una   en su quehacer y entre las tres contribuyen al \u00e9xito del mismo.

R. is 50 years old and lives in the Milagro neighborhood in the city of Cartagena with her husband and 4 children aging from 24 to 30 years old. It is in this community that she has a business called Variedades Sandy where she sells all types of goods such as trousers, jeans, sheets, towels, school shirts and blouses for cash, although she also has some customers that she gives credit to. It is for this business that Julia is asking the financial foundation for $2.300.000, to buy goods such as jeans, sheets, towels, school shirts, blouses, at the request of the customers that she has in various neighborhoods of the city. \r\nJulia has been developing her entrepreneurial ability every since she had a shop with her husband, which she considered to be a good business but very time-consuming,monotonous and which did not agree with her lifestyle. She used to dream of something different, less routine and innovative and where her daughters participate as they do now at Variedades Sandy, therefore she feels her current business is a better decision. When they decided to sell the shop they were left with only two display cabinets and capital that was invested in economic goods in line with their goal sector. This business started to progress very well and it was through a friend who recommended the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation where she found the opportunity to get low interest capital, with which she bought goods to expand her business. Her first loan was in a group and for a total of $300.000. There she received training in business management to achieve what is today \u201cher dream become reality\u201d. Currently she has an individual loan, but she has received 14 and with these finances she has managed to develop her business and give her children an education - they are studying at university, fashion design and administration respectively; and at the same time her daughters work with her and they are the fantastic trio, each one in their own work and between the three of them they contribute to each others' sucess. Julia wants to project her business into new areas, and feels very happy with it. With her profits she has managed to build three apartments, she lives in one of them with her family, and the other two she rents which gives her additional income.  Also her business premises, which was at first in the living room of her home, is a product of the success that she has had working in her micro enterprise, and this is generated by the family union and the collective work directed towards the same activity and with unique family goals.  Julia is very grateful to the Foundation because they believed in them and because they helped to generate a positive impact for her children; it is important to point out that today they are partners of Variedades Sandy, and they feel proud of their parents and of the efforts that they made to achieve something that started out very small; as well the community acknowledges and supports this business as they know that Variedades Sandy fulfils an important role in society and it is there you find everyone. \r\n \r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva

She is 50 years old, married, and has one adult-aged child. To make a living, Lorna operates a buying and selling business, buying agricultural crops like bananas, cassava and copra. She then transports these crops and sells them in the city. Lorna has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $50 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lorna joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase crops and also as additional working capital. Lorna is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase more agricultural crops to sell. This will be her 2nd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy stocks for the general store and fertilizer for her sugarcane. Liberty wants to continue to save up for the future education of her children and to improve her business. Liberty M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\n<b> About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'honorable').

Francisca has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Francisca is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the thirteenth loan taken out by Francisca from ASKI.

At this time, she is working hard to send her children to school. This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Julita as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nJulita operates a bicycle parts business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them per item with a little profit. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJulita dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance

of Central Asian countries are mostly involved in several industries like textile, food production, medicine and teaching. A big portion is on behalf of trade. \r\n\r\nNurgul, 43, has experience in borrowing loans because she started a business breeding and selling cattle in 1999 thanks to a loan borrowed from a local bank. Soon Nurgul purchased a small pavilion where she could promote and sell food products. She said that twelve years of experience in this business have taught her many lessons. Every day work and patience in the past do not allow her to make mistakes in the present. She shares her knowledge with younger generations, and it helps them not to repeat Nurgul\u2019s mistakes. Her monthly income generated from selling food products comprises 39,000 soms. Nurgul plans to use these funds plus those acquired from Kiva lenders for investing in goods circulation and in a purchase of a house. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\t\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

This will be Justina's third loan and she is very happy to know that she will have your support.  With her 1,500 soles, Justina will buy cacao seeds and thereby increase her production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":889530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cacao seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-09T12:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1519.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097816}],"funded_date":"2011-10-10T03:51:15Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":347952,"name":"Otgonbileg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Otgonbileg is 52 years old and lives with her husband, two children and her granddaughter.

They average 26 years of age and two children and live in large traditional extended families in the Lafiala district of the city of Koutiala (Sikasso region, Republic of Mali).  They know one another through community ties and through work in almost the same business, namely making and selling soap.  The women are in high demand in this field of work and enjoy an unparalleled reputation.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn order to satisfy their ever-increasing number of customers, they decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which they are on their fourth solidarity loan (group loan).  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.\r\n<p>\r\nThey plan to use this loan for buying barrels of waste oil and caustic soda.  The soap thus made is then sold wholesale and retail, cash or credit accepted, at the Koutiala marketplace and at the fairs of surrounding villages.  \r\n<p>\r\nThey each hope to realize an average profit of 200,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The funds will be used to pay the loan interest, to provide for the extended family, and to invest the rest in businesses.  Their ambition is to diversify and to open a modern workshop for making soap.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":271220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy waste oil and caustic soda ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kamsa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":93048,"name":"Saing","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saing K., a 26-year-old farmer in Pursat Province, is married to Neoun, 22, who earns a living raising piglets behind the house.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.
