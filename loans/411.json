She wants to use the loan to buy more raw materials, like bags of maize, baskets of cassava, plantain, meat, fish, vegetables, firewood, and other foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nGladys dreams of buying a brand new deep-freezer to enable her to freeze her leftover meats and fish, etc. She would be grateful for your assistance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":423155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more raw materials for her restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Kade","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2009-11-10T22:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":202.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110760243},{"amount":141.66,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-04T09:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":202.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118148946},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-26T07:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":202.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123987082},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T08:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":202.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129017753},{"amount":141.66,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T08:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":202.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136742589},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:01:51Z","rounded_local_amount":202.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144775372}],"funded_date":"2009-11-29T21:11:50Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:01:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":155063,"name":"Rustamhon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0445\u043e\u043d \u0413\u0430\u044e\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0431. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442 44 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 4 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0445\u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \"\u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\". \u041e\u043d \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 20 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0435 \"\u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u043e\u043c\". \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0430\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0438.","en":"Rustamhon G. lives in the city of Kulob.

and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married, 38 years old and has two children aged 7 and 12 that are in private school. She studied cosmetic dermatology for three years and had a beauty salon, but closed it because she met her husband. For nine years her husband has sold fruit and she went to work with him selling fruit every day from 9 am until 10 pm. On the farm she feels tranquil, she can invest and move more capital and learn the business from the other members. She needs a loan of 1600 soles to purchase 30 crates of fruit daily.

From a young age, he demonstrated a talent for agriculture. Naimjon has always tried to be very responsible and very content with his farm work. When he finishes caring for his crops, he goes to help his father, because he wants to repay his father\u2019s efforts. What his father likes best out of the whole agricultural process is the marketing, because he always hopes to get a good price for his crops. But once he gets to the market, he gets a little clumsy and sometimes loses track of the accounting. Naimjon always tries to help him out with some pointers. The loan Naimjon now is asking for is to purchase seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants for his varied crops. The loan will greatly improve Naimjon\u2019s income and his family's living standards.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,000.\r\n\r\nJosefina is now borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can maintain operations of her general store. This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Josefina aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":487386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with Yong, 53, and their three children whom they care for and provide with a good education. Now, one of her children has already married and lives independently. Chea strives to provide the best for her family members; she works hard for them in her fields planted with rice, corn and bananas. She\u2019s been in this line of work for many years on land of her own. \r\n\r\nTaking time from the farming business, she run a business as a fish seller in one market near her community.

Samuel is a good, kind man, but with a strong character for meeting challenges.  He says that his health got bad some time ago and he paid less attention to his work.  When he recovered, he started working again and saw that so many weeds had invaded his farmland that at times he wanted to give them up.  But his enthusiasm, a desire to work, and a love for farming were greater and he had to begin removing the weeds, with the help of his loving wife and children.  Once he finished removing all the weeds from his crops, he started fertilizing them because the weeds had taken all the nutrition from the land.\r\n\r\nHis health is still delicate, so he decided to start another business; selling groceries out of his home.  This requires new capital.  He will use the 1,000 PEN ($375) from this loan to buy primary needs products to stock his store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":932660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-02T21:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1015.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455358}],"funded_date":"2011-12-26T02:20:33Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

For financial reasons she was not able to attend school and began early on to undertake money-generating activities, particularly the sale of snacks and dyeing cloth. In the end, she opted to specialize in dyeing cloth, a business her mother had always been in (she learned the skill from her mother).  <P>\r\nAfter 20 years of doing this work in her home, she has an excellent reputation in the town of Koutiala. Her products sell easily and the demand for them is steadily growing. <P>\r\nIn order to meet this demand, Mrs. Haoua Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is now requesting her first individual loan. <P>\r\nShe buys her \u201cbazin\u201d (a sort of damask; cloth much prized in Mali and in West Africa) in the big open-air market of Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali) and sometimes at the market in Koutiala from specialized wholesalers. She sells her products at home, in the big outdoor market of the town of Koutiala (displayed under a shed roof), or door-to-door, for credit or cash. She sends part of her production to San (the neighboring town near Koutiala) where her sister sells dyed \u201cbazin\u201d. Her clientele is essentially made up of women and a few men. The period before festivals is when she produces and sells the most.<P>\r\nWith this loan, she intends to buy 1 length of \u201crich bazin\u201d in white, 5 lengths of less rich \u201cbazin\u201d, 5 kg of dyes of different shades, and 5 kg of potash.<P>   \r\nShe expects to make a profit of 80,000 FCFA monthly which she will use to make the payments on the loan and contribute to family expenses, investing any remainder back into her business. Mrs. Haoua Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 intends to diversify her activities by opening a shop where she can sell dyed \u201cbazin\u201d and a sales point for dyes and potash for other Koutiala women engaged in dyeing cloth.  <P><B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<P><\/b>\r\nMadame Haoua Dembel\u00e9 \u00e0 50 ans, et vit avec ses 7 enfants ( 3 gar\u00e7ons et 4 filles) et son mari dans une famille monogame au quartier Sogomougou de la pr\u00e9fecture de Koutiala.(troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion \u00e9conomique de la r\u00e9publique du Mali).

EMILY Y. is 36 years old, married with 2 school-age children, and lives in Prk. Malipayon, Brgy. Canjusa, in the coastal municipality of Pulupandan, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nFor the past 7 years since she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emily admits that she has learned a lot in how she should manage her business so that it could grow and continue to help support the growing needs of her family of 4.\r\n\r\nEmily has a food stall in the local market where she sells Ginamos, a local delicacy, and this earns her on the average PHP 12,000.00 per month.\r\n\r\nBecause Ginamos has to be aged, and production is dependent on the availability of the krill, Emily needs additional working capital so that she could maintain the ideal volume of Ginamos on stock. She needs to borrow PHP 20,000.00 as additional capital to sustain her expanding business.\r\n\r\nEmily is working hard to provide for her her children. She is using the income she earns in this business venture to pay for the tuition fees of her 2 children. \r\n\r\nWhat is Ginamos?\r\nGinamos is a generic Hiligaynon (the local dialect in Western Visayas) term for anything that is salted and aged to ferment - in Tagalog it is known as Bagoong. Ginamos can also refer to fermented salted fish, mussels, oysters, etc. but in general, the term Ginamos refers to mashed salted fermented krill - all the others must be qualified - e.g. Ginamos na isda (fermented salted fish) or Ginamos na Tahong (fermented salted mussels).\r\n\r\nGinamos is prepared by mashing sea salt and krill together until the salt is well mixed into the finely ground krill, then it is kept in containers to age until ready. Ginamos in Negros Island is usually moist but firm and sold by the block or smaller bricks. Vendors usually pre-cut the blocks into different sizes to offer the buyers a selection. People usually buy Ginamos either as a flavor enhancer to dishes like Pinakbet (a vegetable stew) or as a dish by itself. When cooked as a dish, it is usually mixed with vinegar and sauteed with lots of garlic and sometimes with fried pork rind, and is served with rice as a meal or with green mangoes as an appetizer.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":361842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

By offering a range of clothing items, she provides a convenient stop for her customers who often will buy more than just one item from her. Gulshan has requested a loan to increase her working capital and help sustain her business. Purchasing inventory from wholesalers has required a substantial investment from Gulshan, which is why she decided to obtain a loan. This loan will give her added flexibility and will help cover some of her growing expenses while she develops a larger business. Additional profits generated by her business will provide her with stable income and the ability to support her family financially. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Province of Western Mongolia. His wife works as a kindergarten teacher. His daughter and son, ages 13 and 11 respectively, attend a local secondary school. \r\n\r\nSer-Od works as a carpenter. He has owned his carpentry business for almost 17 years and, over this long time, he has earned the loyalty of his customers because of the quality of his work and service. Ser-Od currently runs his business out of a rented space and would like to expand his product line in order to enlarge his customer base. He is requesting a 300,000 tugrug (approx. $211 USD) loan to purchase more timber for his growing business.\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

They all reside in a populous neighborhood located north of the city.  For more than two years, Julia has been selling beauty products of a known brand.  She remembers starting her business based on a recommendation of a friend.  When she first started building up her inventory of products, everything was very difficult, but in time she eventually acquired good customers who now buy on a frequent basis and pay on time.  Julia enjoys her work because it allows her to earn a good income without neglecting her household.  In addition, her children have been able to get ahead because of her effort and dedication.  The part she dislikes is walking great distances in order to attract new customers, but she is willing to do it so that she can keep growing.  This hardworking woman has plans to get further ahead by opening a small bazaar in her home so that she can continue forward.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.

is married and lives in Zaporozhye in south central Ukraine. He used to work in a factory. However, after the times of perestroika and the collapse of the Soviet Union, he resigned and started working as a market vendor. Unfortunately, he was unable to make enough at that time to meet his family\u2019s basic needs so he decided to try working in construction. After working there for some time his health began to deteriorate and he was forced to quit. In the meantime, his wife had begun working at the market trying to make ends meet and so Yuryi decided to join her. He was able to get enough money together to purchase a supply of batteries, bulbs, dishware, and other small items to start a small vending kiosk. Today, Yuryi has a successful business selling household items in one of the local markets. \r\n\r\nPrevious loans have secured the sustainability of Yuryi\u2019s business by promoting his sales and allowing him to purchase a new vending stall. Currently, he has two vending facilities which operate efficiently bringing him stable income. Yuryi is requesting a loan of $500 to increase his available working capital.

Preak Ta Thok village in Kandal province. The members plan to use the loan that they obtain for different purposes. The members selected Mr. Reaksmi K. as the village bank president.  He is a hard-working man because he breeds pigs and uses rice to make wine to sell. Since his breeding pigs business is doing well, he wants to expand it by purchasing more piglets to add to his business. His wife, Mrs. Phal Malay, is employed in a garment factory. Mr. Reaksmi K. is 27 years old and the father of a child who is enrolled in the local school. Mrs. Sokthet H. did not come to take a loan but her husband did, so he is shown in the picture instead.  \r\n\r\nSeven members in this group have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

This is 36-year-old Tulafileka F. C. from Tukuyu. She is married with four children between the ages of 1 and 13. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent, an orphan whose parents died of HIV. \n\nTulafileka has been running a grocery business since 2007. A genge (grocery store) is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. \n\nTulafileka works at her business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Tulafileka currently earns about 95USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 625USD in order to purchase more sugar, beans, salt, cooking oil, rice, and wheat flour in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of her business. Tulafileka thanks you for your support!\n\nAbout SELFINA\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, and therefore they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":303767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more sugar, beans, salt, cooking oil rice, and wheat flour in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tulafileka F.

For this reason, Farrukh gives thanks to IMON and Kiva for the support they are giving him with this loan, which will be of great benefit to his crops. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He and his wife have six children, ages 19, 17, 15, 13, 10, and 8. Vitaliano's father died when he was young, so he began helping his mother on their farm. As a result, he never finished primary school and hardly knows how to read or write. Like many dairy cow farmers in the area, he learned farming by helping his parents when he was a child. Vitaliano is a dairy cow farmer who produces and sells milk but, at the moment, they have only three dairy cows. Vitaliano and his family live in a small and humble home in Quillacollo, a large suburb of the city of Cochabamba. \r\n\r\nWith this loan from CIDRE, Vitaliano will purchase another dairy cow to augment his milk production. He hopes to increase his earnings and improve his family's quality of life. Vitaliano would like to construct a new home for his family and hopes that his five younger children will be able to study to become professionals. His oldest daughter could not continue her studies because Vitaliano and his wife lacked the financing necessary to pay for her education at the time, so she only studied through primary school and is currently working in Argentina."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":423259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Yolanda has been engaged in her business for over 14 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Yolanda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Yolanda is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Yolanda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her fourteenth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stocks to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and meet her family needs. \r\n\r\nGina E. is truly a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Dungganon is a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable.\" Through this alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities they could not even have dreamed of.

is Cheryl A., 40, resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Leonardo, a pedicab driver, and together they have a child who helps her with the business. By the grace of God, Cheryl has managed to support her child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCheryl operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling at piecemeal rates. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nCheryl dreams of being able to finish college education of her children with all of her work with the business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":644281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-11-19T19:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cheryl ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2185.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816881},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2914.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652824},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2914.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191395979},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2913.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814087}],"funded_date":"2010-11-19T22:52:07Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":254128,"name":"Hellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen N. lives in the Busega neighborhood of Kampala, Uganda.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has three sons. Her husband has a store for selling generators where there is high demand for generators. This is the only source of income for the family. Lubna wants to help her husband in the purchase of more generators for sale but she does not have enough money so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Lubna gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to help her husband to sell more, increase his income and provide his family with better living conditions. Lubna is a conservative woman so her husband is photographed instead next to his store.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers, with the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings along to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

All of the women belonging to this bank have a least two businesses. <p>\r\nThey invest the money borrowed in different economic ventures like breeding bulls and pigs and selling chicken, vegetables, baked goods and other foods.  The also sell firewood, cosmetics and heliconia leaves (used to make tamales).<p>\r\nIt was impressive to see the entire group of women so decided about how they would be using the money that they were borrowing.  Norma M. commented that she was going to use a part of her loan to sell cosmetics while the other part would be invested in fruit to sell in the market.  Juana S. said that as soon as she received her loan, she was going to purchase 300 kg of chicken to sell in the market.  Mar\u00eda P., like the large majority of the group, was going to buy 150 bunches of heliconia leaves to then sell to distributors.  While the women sell one bunch of leaves for seven quetzals, a distributor can sell in the cities for double the price.  Mar\u00eda P. was going to invest her money in her tortilla business and in the purchase of firewood.<p>\r\nWhen asked why they like to work with Friendship Bridge, the women said that it was primarily because it gives them a chance to save money.  The inability to save is one of the reasons people can\u2019t get out of poverty.  Additionally, they said that the low interest and the timeframe the institution offered for repaying the loans help them with their businesses.  Also, working under the bank\u2019s methodology is something they like very much.<p>\r\nThe women believe that within the Barrio El Calvario Communal Bank they are all equal.  Not only that, but there is a lot of communication and understanding within the communal bank.  It seems that working with Friendship Bridge has changed their lives.  They are very grateful to the institution and to those who invest in them through Kiva because people have believed in them.  They are sure that they will not let us down.  That\u2019s why helping this and many other groups of women is important, because one gives them a chance and a ray of hope.<p><b>Translated form Spanish by Hugh Yarbrough, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Dentro de este banco comunal uno puede encontrar mujeres corajudas y con una visi\u00f3n empresarial muy caracter\u00edstica de las empresarias de la costa de Guatemala. Todas las clientas dentro de este banco tienen dos negocios como m\u00ednimo.\r\n\r\n<P>Ellas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en distintas actividades econ\u00f3micas, tales como la crianza de toros y cerdos, venta de pollo, venta de comidas, venta de verduras, venta de le\u00f1a, venta ambulante de cosm\u00e9ticos, panader\u00eda y la venta de hojas de mashan (las cuales son usadas para envolver los tamales).\r\n\r\n<P>Fue impresionante ver a todo un grupo de mujeres tan decididas en que utilizar el pr\u00e9stamos que se les iba a otorgar. Norma M., coment\u00f3 que ella iba a usar parte de su pr\u00e9stamo para la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos que los iba a vender de manera ambulante, mientras que la otra parte la iba a invertir en la compra de fruta para venderla en el mercado. Juana S., dijo que a penas recib\u00eda su pr\u00e9stamo lo iba a invertir en la compra de tres quintales de pollos destazados para su venta en el mercado. Mar\u00eda P., como la gran mayor\u00eda del grupo, iba a comprar 150 racimos de hojas de mashan para luego venderlo a los intermediaros. Ellas venden un racimo a siete quetzales, mientras que un intermediario puede llegar a venderlo en las ciudades por el doble del precio. Mar\u00eda P., va a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en su tortilleria y en la compra de le\u00f1a. \r\n\r\n<P>Cuando se les pregunto porque les gusta trabajar con Friendship Bridge ellas comentaron que era primordialmente porque les daba un espacio para ahorrar. La falta de capacidad de ahorrar es uno de los motivos por los cuales las personas no pueden salir de la pobreza. Adicionalmente, dijeron que los bajos intereses y el plazo que les ofrec\u00eda la instituci\u00f3n las ayudaba con su negocio. Tambi\u00e9n, trabajar bajo metodolog\u00eda  de bancos comunales les gusta mucho. \r\n\r\n<P>Las se\u00f1oras opinan que dentro del banco comunal Barrio el Calvario todas son iguales. No solo eso, sino que hay mucha comunicaci\u00f3n y comprensi\u00f3n dentro del banco comunal. Al parecer trabajar con Friendship Bridge les ha cambiado la vida. Ellas agradecen mucho a la instituci\u00f3n y a las personas que invierten en ellas desde Kiva por que confiaron en ellas y est\u00e1n seguras de no nos van a defraudar. Es por eso que seguir apoyando a este y a muchos gruP. de mujeres es importante, ya que uno les da un respiro y una luz de esperanza."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":149354,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

It was founded in 1974. Today, it has a total of 750 pupils with a staff of twenty-three teachers. Since its inception in 1974, the school has produced many of the professionals in town and the country at large.\n\nThis Primary School continues to prove itself in both the academic arena and in sport. Ninety-eight percent of the pupils they sent last academic year for the National Primary School Exams (NPSE) had clear passes. This academic year, they expect to have a 100% passes at the NPSE.\n\nThis is the first loan the school is seeking from SMT.  With this loan, they will be able to invest in some petty-trading in order to supplement their monthly salaries. Some however will use theirs to either buy pieces of furniture or in constructing houses. This loan will definitely improve the economic status of these teachers. \n\nJohn B. C.

He is fifty-five years of age, married with six children between the ages of two and thirty-four. John is currently building a second home for himself.  He will use his loan to buy building materials to continue with the building process. This house will consist of three bedrooms, a parlor, a store and a toilet. Once he is finished building it, it will be an estimated value of Le 10,000,000 \u2013 Le 11,000,000 (approx. US$ 3000 \u2013 US$ 3600). \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":259976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-24T04:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4575,"lender_count":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John B.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter C.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"William D.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan R.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zainabu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edwin S.

Tuao North, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 23 years old. Mary Joy is the group leader for a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or default.\n\nMary Joy is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Mary Joy owns and operates a business making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from preparing and selling pork and chicken barbeque. Mary Joy has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\n\nIn 2008, Mary Joy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mary Joy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to to purchase the raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Mary Joy is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the range of products offered. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Mary Joy from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs. \n\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":450781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Enecita has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Enecita joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Enecita is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her third from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

After this she became pregnant. After her children died during the Mozambican Civil War, she became despondent. Her sister invited Lorta to live with her in the district of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland. After moving there she began to work as a domestic servant.\r\n\r\nWith her earnings, Lorta started her own business, and then built a house with the profit from that enterprise. However, due to expenses related to her son\u2019s wedding she is close to bankruptcy. For this reason she is asking for a loan in the amount of 8000 meticais to shore up her business. She works two days a week, Wednesdays and Saturdays, selling at an unofficial market where people trade in imported goods. She earns about 5000 meticais per month and uses this income to cover household expenses. She also saves some each month.\r\n\r\nThis is Lorta\u2019s 3rd loan with Hluvuku and her 2nd with Kiva. The first loan, in the amount of 8000 meticais, was used to help shore up her business. The second, in the amount of 10,000 meticais, was used to increase her stock of merchandise. This third loan, for 15,000 meticais, will be used for the same purpose, to buy packs of used clothing for resale. Lorta is confident that she will repay this loan even sooner than required so that she can get another loan to finish building a house for her son.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":548391,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of packs of used clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorta Uaquene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":659.14},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":688.93},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":720.08},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":752.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":786.65},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":822.21},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":859.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":898.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":938.84},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":981.28},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1025.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1072},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1120.46},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1171.11},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1224.05},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1279.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.77},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.6},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.6},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.16},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.61},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.14},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

Adjo Georgette was born in 1979 in Lom\u00e9. She is single. She is a master hairdresser with a dozen apprentices. She supports her parents,  brothers and sisters. After graduating first of her class, Georgette opened up a shop under a shed by the side of a road where she brilliantly practices her job. Despite the number of her apprentices, Miss S. is not anymore able to satisfy her customers because of lack of adequate equipment and the tightness of her shop. To establish her customer loyalty and to increase their number, she imperatively needs to open up another shop and to equip it by buying hairdryers, shampoos and others modern products. To do so requires financial means that she does not have. Therefore, she is soliciting a $1200 loan that she will pay back with her income which will triple with the acquisition of the projected equipment.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from [French] by [Bijou Kuzimbu], Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\nMlle S.

The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today it remains a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About IMON International <\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":303823,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

G. is from the village of Malangka, Gingoog City, in the Philippines. She is twenty-four years-old and married with three young children. Marites owns and operates a mini-restaurant called a \"carenderia\".  While not the only revenue generator, the main source of income for the business comes from serving a variety of different meals to local customers. Marites has run her business for over four years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP per month from it.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Marites joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase food and drinks for the restaurant. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Marites from HSPFI. She plans to save the additional revenue generated from the business as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

G. sells merchandise through catalogs such as men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing, perfumes, and accessories.  She also produces hand-knitted purses, blouses, tablecloths, and fabrics.  Carmen is 34 years old and has two sons, ages 6 and 9.  She lives in the July 20th neighborhood of Barranquilla, which is a mixture of business and residential areas.  In this neighborhood, you will find shopping centers, supermarkets, the metropolitan soccer stadium, inns, taverns, and numerous residential buildings and houses.  \r\n<p>\r\nCarmen started her business in 2000 when a neighbor taught her how to knit.   She was still working as a salesperson at a department store in Barranquilla.  The birth of her son in 2001 forced her to quit her job so that she could dedicate herself to taking care of her baby.  Her customers consist of neighbors, friends, relatives, and people who have been recommended to her.  Although there is significant competition, she maintains her clientele because of the quality of her service and the prices she offers.  Every 21 days, she places orders for her catalog products and also purchases items that are not found in the catalogs but are frequently requested.  She has had three previous loans with the Foundation that have enabled her to increase her income and educate her children.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of 1,500,000 COP that she requested, Carmen will invest in the purchase of catalog merchandise such as clothing, perfumes, accessories, as well as wholesale yarn for cash.  She also plans to buy wooden utensils and ornaments made of stone.  Carmen says her biggest challenges are the lack of operating capital and not having her own home.  Sometime later, she dreams of buying a house and expanding her business with the loans provided by Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

John Awah and they have brought forth five children. A woman who does not like to depend on the husband for all the family needs, and finding it so difficult to accomplish this task, Lum J. joined GHAPE in 1998. \r\n<p>\r\nShe also has been having marital problems which causes her to be sad all the time but she is appreciative of the fact that she is alive. Her desire is to give her children love and education. She states that she feels better each time she provides something small to her children. \r\n<p>\r\nHer inability to get investment capital which could consistently generate income for her to meet her children\u2019s needs is what motivated her to obtain a loan from GHAPE.\u2028\u2028With her loan she plans to buy a two-wheel motorcycle. She knows this business will succeed because she is located at a good business site and she is a good rider for the motorcycle. \r\n<p>\r\nShe plans to use the profits generated to sponsor her children in school and to cater for the basic needs of her family.\u2028She plans to pay her loan in 24 months. The first installment repayment shall be done on the fourth month of loan disbursement.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works toward the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.\r\n<p>\r\nClients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":553184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a two wheel motorcycle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

He is married, 30 years old, the father of a three-year old boy and a carpenter.\r\n\r\nHe explains that he chose this profession because he learned it as a child as his father was a carpenter and left him his tools so he'd be able to work. He says it is a good business that provides him with a good income. He is going to use the loan to invest in the purchase of materials to continue working, including wood, glue and paint.\r\n\r\nThe earnings he is getting out of the business benefit him and his family very much. He is now financially more secure, which is going to help now that his son is starting preschool and they will have to buy school materials for him. \r\n\r\nHe also says that his business is benefitting the community as there aren't many carpenters in the town and people used to have to go far to order what they need. That's no longer the case, as they now have Joiy's carpenter's worshop nearby.\r\n\r\nHis main goal is to see his son grow up and support him through his studies so that he can have a career and a good profession. He would also like a larger workshop to support his mother, who is a widow and whom he helps financially, and to improve his standard of living.\r\n\r\nHe mentions that all group members are very reliable and responsible workers now they have had the chance to know each other. \r\n\r\nJoniy would like to thank FRAC and KIVA because they have enabled him to own his own business and change his life and his family's. \r\n\r\nCosta Brava group members and their business activities are:\r\nJoniy D.
