She is single and has two children who currently attend school. For the past four years, Elizabeth has been working hard to manage her salon where she does hairdressing for local women. Elizabeth's loan group is comprised of two hardworking women. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is requesting a 700,000 UGX loan to help expand her business and purchase equipment needed to do special braids. Her loan will help her generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Elizabeth hopes that in the future she will be able to own a boutique. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Elizabeth's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":914212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Edith  se dedica a la venta de productos de primera necesidad, para eso cuenta con una bodega que abri\u00f3 en su casa, comenzando con muy poca mercader\u00eda que logr\u00f3 comprar gracias a un peque\u00f1o capital que ten\u00eda ahorrado, luego con mucho esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n logr\u00f3 hacerse conocida y ampliar su negocio.

Lo que le gusta de su actividad  es el poder socializarse, logrando hacer nuevas amistades, con los cuales puede intercambiar ideas; adem\u00e1s del ingreso econ\u00f3mico que le genera y puede apoyar con los gastos del hogar a su pareja que se dedica al servicio de mototaxi. Si embargo, los clientes le insisten en la venta a cr\u00e9dito, por lo que niega debido a la impuntualidad de pago.

She lives with Emilio and their three children, who are 14, 16, and 20 years old, in a house that they own.  They were able to purchase the house with a lot of effort. \r\n\r\nEdith works selling necessity items in a general store located in her home.  She started her business with very little merchandise that she was able to buy with money she had saved.  Later, with a lot of effort and dedication, she became well known and expanded her store.  She has had this business for 20 years.  Her children help her serve her customers, who are mostly her neighbors.  The thing she likes best about her business is being able to socialize and make new friends with whom she can exchange ideas.  In addition to the income she earns that helps with household expenses, her husband works as a mototaxi driver.

(Yes, I did double-check the name of the lending group, but I will leave it to you for the correct pronunciation.) Since Lugazi is in a very rural area, most of the members are in agriculture. Aisha is an exception. When I asked her what her business was she told me she was a \u201chawker\u201d. <p>\r\nOnce I understood what she was saying, I still had a problem with the word, since in my culture it is often deemed a business that has illegal connotations. But I did not want to change the word, since this is what she said, so let me clarify. A hawker is someone who sells there goods without the benefit of a fixed location. They therefore walk around busy markets and taxi parks carrying and selling their wares.  Aisha sells used clothing. This is not an easy job and most would like to be able to afford to rent a store front. There are many hawkers on the streets and they are seen as just as respectable as storefront owners, though not as well off. \r\n<p>\r\nAisha has been a hawker for two years and a member of her lending group for nine years, hence her position as chairperson. I got the feeling she has had a downturn in her life, but is determined to be able to rent a storefront. She is married and has three children.

She\u2019s married with two children. The difficult circumstances and hardships in her life made her recognize the value of work from a very young age. For about 12 years she has been purchasing young sheep and calves in the local market, fattening and selling them.<P>\r\n\r\n Risky is a very hard-working woman, and her diligence is incredible. She works with a strength worthy of immense admiration. She has always looked for a way to be an important protagonist by providing extra income to her home. Risky wakes up early every morning to feed her cows and bulls, with the goal of fattening them and selling them at the best price in the local market. She started this occupation because of the recommendation and teaching of her beloved mother. <P>\r\n\r\nThanks to this activity Risky is offering her children an education. Risky wants to keep educating them because she hopes that they\u2019ll reach the goals that they have laid out for themselves. With this purpose in mind, she is requesting a loan of 800 USD to buy calves in order to expand her business. Let\u2019s support this brave woman who has a lot of courage and strength to live! \r\n\r\n<P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Lorna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. Lorna is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.

He still works occasionally in the timber business when he is available, but that is only a minor source of income for him these days. He requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo for Kes. 40,000 to start a poultry farming business.\n\nKaria is married with four children, ages 5, 8, 14, and 18 years old, all of whom are currently enrolled in school. It is hoped that the extra income from this loan will increase the family's overall well being and assist in paying the children's school fees. He wants to provide a comfortable life for his family so they do not need to constantly worry about finances.\n\nIn the future, Karia wants to purchase a vehicle so he can easily transport farm produce to market. He is hopeful for the future, and said that so far Juhudi Kilimo has provided a beneficial relationship.

Now she dedicates herself to raising and selling cattle, and with the income she generates she provides a better quality of life for her children, who are her greatest joy and have become her best friends.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<em><p>\r\nIMON's History<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives at his parents' house, along with his daughter, Karol, of 2 years old.  Above all, he wishes to offer her a better future and for that he is willing to working very hard.  When he was a child, his parents taught him everything he needed to know about their small farm and little by little with the passing of time, he began to become in charge of his parents' land, since his older siblings decided to dedicate themselves to other professions.  Nowadays, he has an extensive amount of land to plant cacao and coco leaves.  After they are harvested, they are sold in the city of San Francisco.  What he enjoys most about his job is the cultivation because he knows that, luckily, with this activity he can support his family.

She began by buying a small pig and then after awhile requesting a loan from FAMA so that she could buy several more. She learned on her own and one of her neighbors is her supplier. Gloria gets up very earlier to do her housework and take care of the pigs. Her husband helps her with the daily tasks she has to do, such as giving the pigs their concentrated whey and cleaning the pigsty.\r\n\r\nGloria has an advantage in that the investment she makes is short term and she is quickly able to see a return and re-invest.

This is why he is turning to a Kiva loan, the first funding he is getting from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he will buy materials such as leather, imitation leather, rubber, and hardware, wholesale and in cash, with the goal of taking advantage of this season of high sales and so increase his income and profits in his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":951612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials such as leather, imitation leather, rubber, and hardware.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-20T05:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marwin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":66643},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":79849},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":81712},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83619},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85570},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87567},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89610},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91701},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":93841},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96030},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":98271},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":115587}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.81},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.91},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.28},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.43},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.61},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.81,"local_amount":66643,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:44Z","rounded_local_amount":69333.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325025},{"amount":42.91,"local_amount":79849,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83072.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039087},{"amount":43.91,"local_amount":81712,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":85011.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651228},{"amount":44.94,"local_amount":83619,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":86995.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140835},{"amount":45.98,"local_amount":85570,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":89024.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100734},{"amount":95.21,"local_amount":177177,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":184330.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338352},{"amount":49.28,"local_amount":91701,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":95403.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774768},{"amount":154.85,"local_amount":288142,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":299775.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130044},{"amount":62.11,"local_amount":115587,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":120253.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071776}],"funded_date":"2012-01-05T20:31:40Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:09:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":376768,"name":"Maria Leucadia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leucadia tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad esta casada con el se\u00f1or Aristeo y tienen 7 hijos pero nada mas 5 viven con ellos los cuales estudian la primaria y la secundaria.

End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are very beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. These loans allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make their payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and a default rate of 0% on Kiva loans.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":231551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a cow and start a cow-breeding business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2008-11-29T19:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phalla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":218750},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":218750},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":218750},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":218750},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":218750},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":218750},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":218750},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":218750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T12:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":132330.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9899924},{"amount":45,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T12:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":185262.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9899925},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":132330.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14824018},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:52:22Z","rounded_local_amount":132330.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20360430},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":132330.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27049525},{"amount":60.42,"local_amount":235000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T11:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":248781.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35941273},{"amount":55.29,"local_amount":215000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":227608.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44398814},{"amount":160.73,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-27T07:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":661652.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52906629}],"funded_date":"2008-11-30T13:17:46Z","paid_date":"2009-07-27T07:40:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":80888,"name":"Association Ditorguine Agoe Zongo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette association est Situ\u00e9e dans le quartier Ago\u00e8 Zongo dans la ville de Lom\u00e9 (Togo), l\u2019association DITORGUINE AGOE ZONGO est une association qui fut cr\u00e9e en 2005 et regroupe en son sein  trois (3) femmes dynamiques, toutes clientes de WAGES : madame D. sofi, S.

In the beginning, her business suffered greatly--many times she was left with unsold produce because she didn't have a clientele.

Xilitla is a tourist place, which is visited by many foreigners.  It has natural places that are like paradise.  Its climate is warm and humid.\r\n\r\nThe group is comprised of four people; Martha Patricia H. C., Maria Olivia M. Zu\u00f1iga, and Laura H. C..\r\n\r\nFor over three years these people have been selling by catalog.  This activity has helped them get their families ahead and helped their husbands with the family expenses.\r\n\r\nVirginia M. Zu\u00f1iga has been making \u201czacahuil\u201d (a large tamale) for ten years.  She does this every Sunday, and she sells by the side of the road.  She is 51, and she has five children.  Two of the children are dependent upon her.  This activity has helped her give her children an education.  It also helps with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan for $2,000 to buy raw materials like \u201cpapatla\u201d leaves, which are similar to banana leaves.  She will also buy Chinese chili or \u201ccascabel\u201d, shortening, pork, and chicken for her customers\u2019 preferences.  She uses a clay stove, which her husband made in her own house.  It heats for three hours before she puts the zachuil in the oven.  She leaves them in for eight to nine hours so that they are ready for Sunday.  She does all of this work one day ahead of time.  This activity is a tradition in this region.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":399077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Making \u201czacahuil\u201d (a large tamale)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"XILITLA, S.L.P.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2009-10-07T15:10:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.18},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.18},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.18},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.18},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":229.53,"local_amount":3060.41,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3097.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96952649},{"amount":65.78,"local_amount":877.09,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:25Z","rounded_local_amount":887.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794806},{"amount":42.19,"local_amount":562.5,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":569.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794807},{"amount":42.19,"local_amount":562.5,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":569.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794808},{"amount":42.19,"local_amount":562.5,"processed_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":569.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794809},{"amount":162.33,"local_amount":2164.43,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2190.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110685964},{"amount":48.6,"local_amount":648.07,"processed_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":655.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080308},{"amount":42.19,"local_amount":562.5,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:47Z","rounded_local_amount":569.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080309}],"funded_date":"2009-10-08T21:06:18Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":146524,"name":"Vossin Rhode","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"L.

In all, there are 23 members of the group, and the majority of them make a living farming.  This is the first loan that Jorge has taken out with Cooperativa San Jos\u00e9.\r\n\r\nJorge also makes a living farming: he grows cacao and passion fruit. He makes his purchases in Matilde Esther each month and also sells his produce there.  \r\n\r\nJorge will use the loan he is requesting to invest in cacao and passion fruit seeds.  He sees the loan as an opportunity to get ahead.  His dream is to have a field so that he can increase his production.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ahmad has spent several years in the agriculture business growing potatoes and wheat on his land. He also raises cattle. It is important to stress that he is a man whose responsibility is to provide for his family by giving them all that is necessary for their development.  He has a friendly family who are always trying to help each other. \r\n\r\nToday Ahmad needs a loan to obtain technological assistance for his crops. With part of the loan he will also purchase cattle to increase his number of animals. He awaits the approval of this loan confidently, knowing that it will be of enormous use to his business, and that his family will benefit greatly.  The loan will improve Ahmad\u2019s income and his family's living standards, for which he offers a sincere thank-you!    \r\n\r\nAhmad\u2019s wife appears in the photo.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history.  It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tohirboy has worked for many years in the difficult business of raising cattle. He is an exemplary husband in that he always tries his hardest to provide food for his wife and two children in their home. After purchasing his cattle, Iskandar provides them with all the right conditions for their growth: taking care of their food and protection and making sure they don\u2019t get lost. Once they\u2019re fully mature, Iskandar sells them in his area and also provides their milk for sale. \r\n\r\nCurrently he needs to purchase cattle to raise and for this reason is turning to IMON International to obtain a loan of $1,000. Iskandar thanks KIVA for the support that KIVA presents to small entrepreneurs.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about IMON International's work, please visit:

In this way they make good profits.\r\n\r\nRodolfo enjoys his business a lot.  While his wife sells in the store, he travels the streets in his three-wheeled vehicle selling his fruit and, in this way, they make good profits which cover their children's education and well-being and the monthly rent for their business premises which is very expensive.  This enterprising man works hard with the conviction that in the future he will buy his own stall in the market itself or nearby.  For the moment, his priority is to stock his business with a range of fruits since they sell well in this summer season.\r\n\r\nThis is Rodolfo's first loan with MFP and he says that they trust him because he is very pleasant and responsible.

She has no higher education or work experience, only her wits and her desire to succeed in life. She is a very hardworking, progressive, and honest farmer from a very remote village in the Kitale area of Kenya. This area is very fertile, with favorable weather patterns that support farming activities. \n\nHellen is happily married and the proud mother of a lovely family, and together they live on a small piece of land that she really treasures. Her primary sources of income are eggs and milk. Although this humble and industrious mother makes a profit, she faces the challenge of not being able to produce enough to meet the ready market that is available. Therefore, she is seeking funds from Kiva lenders to buy farm inputs like good fertilizer and good-quality seeds. \n\nThrough this loan, she will double her production, and this will translate into increased income. She then intends to save more money in the future so that she can develop her farming and also build a new modern house.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in the neighbourhood of Parco loma near Santa Rosa which is located 45 minutes from the outskirts of Cuenca.\r\nShe is 31 years old and has been married for a few years. She has a good relationship with her husband who is a public transport driver. They currently live in the house of her relatives.

The advantages of her job are the rewards that she gains through the sale of her products. The disadvantages are late-paying clients and long hours spent walking, since she visits her customers house by house.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan and she gets along very well with the other members. Mar\u00eda Zha\u00f1ay encouraged her to become part of this great group of very happy and supportive women.

her own car for her convenience and to offer a better service to her customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Suzanne Grasso, Kiva

He lives in Kobenyang, Momo Division, in the northwest region of Cameroon. As a very hard-working guy. He has faced some major challenges in life, such as inadequate funds to pay for his children's education, ill health, and death of relatives. In 2008, he saw GHAPE as a source of relief and became a member. He has received and repaid loans from GHAPE twice and his previous repayments were encouraging.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he is requesting now, he plans to invest in his farm. With the profit from the loan, he will pay for his children's education, clothe them, and give them good food and good medication whenever they are sick.\r\n\t\r\nHe prefers to receive loan from GHAPE, rather than other financial institutions, because of the training GHAPE offers and because proper follow-up is done to ensure the loan is properly managed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach for People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum

With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her increase their family income to PHP 22,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th loan, she is requesting PHP 15,000 which she will use to purchase a new engine for their fishing boat so that her husband could continue with his fishing activities and Rosalie will have fish to sell. They are both working very hard to send all their children to school. Rosalie S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He lives in his own home along with his wife Maura, 56, and his youngest son Roberto, 30, who both help him plant and harvest his crops. His extensive fields of cocoa, coffee and coca leaves are the fruits of his arduous labor and firm conviction to move up in life. His products are in high demand in the city of San Francisco since his reputation of harvesting quality products helps him sell the items at very good prices. What he most enjoys about his work is guarding his crops from insects that could slow their development. He has been doing this activity for 40 years and considers the most difficult part to be transporting his products since they are very heavy and tire him out. In the future, he hopes to purchase new plots of land to expand his crops. This is his seventh loan with Kiva partner FP, and he knows that this support will be very beneficial to his work's progress. He is a very happy member of his community bank and he always keeps order at the meetings. With the 2,000 soles he is requesting, he plans to purchase fertilizer to apply to his crops so they are more productive."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":643809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer for his crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-20T05:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":168.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":176.97},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":181.24},{"due_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":189.62},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":196.32},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":203.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":210.42},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":217.03},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":225.51},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":231.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.7},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.74},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.68},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.27},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.68},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":61.13,"local_amount":168.63,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":171.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588878},{"amount":64.15,"local_amount":176.97,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:13Z","rounded_local_amount":180.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725378},{"amount":65.7,"local_amount":181.24,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":184.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463475},{"amount":68.74,"local_amount":189.62,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":193.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886858},{"amount":71.16,"local_amount":196.32,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":199.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327211},{"amount":73.68,"local_amount":203.24,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":206.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195764},{"amount":76.27,"local_amount":210.42,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":214.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269461},{"amount":78.68,"local_amount":217.03,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":220.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549515},{"amount":81.75,"local_amount":225.51,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":229.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718253},{"amount":83.74,"local_amount":231.02,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":235.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349857}],"funded_date":"2010-11-20T09:56:37Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":253852,"name":"Mesaid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mesaid S. is married and has three children, two of whom attend school.

training for medical professionals. Audrey has been working in the medical sector for over 30 years. She was originally a medic in the Army and then began training others in 1986. Her passion for teaching led her to open her own training center to ensure students receive top quality courses.  \r\n\r\nThe Visions CPR courses give medical professionals the skills to save lives. Audrey\u2019s loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana was used to replace old equipment, to pay three months\u2019 rent on the facility, and to put money aside to pay instructors. There are many companies that offer training in the industry, so Audrey has to make Visions CPR stand out. She does this by buying state of the art equipment and by hiring professional paramedics to teach classes. The professional paramedics give her clients \u201coff the books\u201d knowledge that they may not receive at other training centers.\r\n\r\nAudrey opened her business in 2006 and has been working to improve it since then. Her advice to people opening new businesses is to find the best ways to advertise because advertising can be difficult. She also wants to tell new entrepreneurs that starting a business is not easy. She says, \u201cYou have to have a desire to do what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Audrey has proven that being patient and diligent, despite setbacks, will help a business succeed. She looks forward to continuing to provide medical professionals with the courses they need.  \r\n\r\nFeel free to check out her website:
