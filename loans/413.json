Carolina has worked for 12 years as a chef, earning a fixed salary, at a prominent hotel situated 200 meters from her residence. She was the only source of income in her family (her mother could not work due to her age and her son was a minor). However, Carolina was able to save, and 8 years ago, she opened a grocery store in her home. Her mother and her son help her. She sells all types of common products, like sugar, olive oil, milk products, beverages, and ready-made foods, which she prepares herself. <p> Her biggest concern has always been her son's education. Thankfully, her effort and dedication has helped her pay for the education of her son, who, in the coming year, will eventually attend the university. Since the cost of his studies will only continue to increase, Carolina hopes to advance her business so that she can obtain greater profits. For her to be able increase her sales, she must increase her stock.

Kholmat keeps going, thanks to the help and enthusiasm of his children and his wife, who helps him with caring for the animals.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

From the time he was very young, he was characterized as an excellent student.  He finished his studies, but with the difficult economic situation in the country, he could not find work at any company. \r\n<p>\r\nDilshod decided to invest his small savings, to start his own business selling rice at the market.  Now it is the sole source of income for his family, including his wife and four children. \r\n<p>\r\nDue to the high demand for his products, because of their excellent quality, size and flavor,  Dilshod has decided to apply for a loan of $ 700 to buy more goods for selling.  This will allow him to earn more and improve his living.  \r\n<p>\r\n-------------------------------\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others.  The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History...\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and its lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells children's clothes. Thanks to the support of her spouse and through her own efforts, Shoira has been able to expand her business, which began with very little inventory and in a small space, and which now has a bigger space and a larger clientele. With this loan in the amount of 4,000 Somoni, she will buy a greater variety of clothing for sale, specifically by adding women's clothing to her inventory.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Ismatillo is a 56-year-old married man who lives with his daughter and owns a small farm. Ismatillo is a schoolteacher by profession and since he earns little, he also runs a business of raising and selling cattle. He has fifteen years of experience in this field. Since cattle raising and selling is profitable, Ismatillo has become a very successful businessman.\r\n\r\nIsmatillo has a friendly family which is always trying to help one another. Thus, his wife and daughter help him with his cattle raising business. He works very hard and spends his weekend time with the cattle, cleaning them, feeding and pasturing. \r\n\r\nNow Ismatillo wants to expand his business and buy more cattle, so he applied for a loan of $1500. He promises to repay the loan in time and thanks all lenders for their support. With your help Ismatillo can get ahead.  \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Mauro M., a welder.  Erlinda is the mother of six children, two of whom are already working and settled down with their own families.  Another two are enrolled in college, one is in high school, and the youngest is in elementary school. By the grace of God, Erlinda has managed to support her older children's education up to the college level. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send all of her remaining children through college. Erlinda herself has been a college student and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nErlinda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a bottle of shampoo, some cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at a wholesale price and selling them at a retail price.  Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She does a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue business operations, she is requesting a Php8,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nErlinda dreams to be able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her busines. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship group to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":597037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-09-09T21:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3199.98,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3556.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172089071},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2370.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380435},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2370.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816771},{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":533.38,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":592.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652720}],"funded_date":"2010-09-11T19:55:02Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Margaret Rosen","image":null}},{"id":233760,"name":"Chheang's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Twenty four people make up this group located in Slab Ta Aon village, Kandal province.

independencia y utilizar sus habilidades y conocimientos de una manera productiva. Fue as\u00ed como empez\u00f3 estudiando una carrera a distancia a trav\u00e9s del internet, compro su primer computador y posteriormente una impresora, donde se le facilit\u00f3 imprimir m\u00f3dulos de estudio, copias para su familia y para la comunidad que requer\u00eda de sus servicios dando curso a su altruismo innato; posteriormente lo convirti\u00f3 en su negocio y decidi\u00f3 ampliarlo, iniciando contactos con personal de gesti\u00f3n humana en la universidad donde estudiaba virtualmente, as\u00ed mismo empez\u00f3 a ofrecer los m\u00f3dulos a sus compa\u00f1eros de estudio, logrando hacerles una oferta m\u00e1s econ\u00f3mica en su carrera universitaria. No satisfecho con esto se puso en contacto con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, a trav\u00e9s de  su asesor para recibir asesor\u00eda y apoyo en cr\u00e9dito para ampliar su negocio de una forma organizada; comprar papeler\u00eda en volumen, vitrinas, y otros accesorios con los que potencializar\u00eda su capacidad comercial y con este objetivo conseguir  en un futuro, que la universidad a distancia apruebe su publicidad en los medios virtuales y hacer realidad su sue\u00f1o de crecimiento. \nGerardo es un hombre muy disciplinado y activo, trabaja como empleado en un almac\u00e9n de cadena, est\u00e1 estudiando a distancia y desde hace 5 a\u00f1os tiene el negocio descrito. En su negocio refleja estados financieros que muestran el buen manejo de su negocio, con resultados de liquidez pues no existe endeudamiento, as\u00ed como  su rentabilidad expresa un valor positivo de acuerdo con el tipo de actividad que ejerce y sus ingresos son provenientes de dos fuentes importantes: de su negocio y de su trabajo como empleado de una empresa.\nEn la actualidad sus buenas relaciones con su entorno ha impresionado, generando la recomendaci\u00f3n de la universidad en la cual estudia,  para que se vincule con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el fin de lograr capital para que ampl\u00ede su infraestructura, con la finalidad de darle un contrato de impresi\u00f3n de m\u00f3dulos por semestre para los estudiantes. Esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, pues necesita comprar papeler\u00eda al por mayor y un computador para ampliar su infraestructura de acuerdo a los requerimientos  que hace la Universidad para lograr el contrato que Gerardo persigue\n","en":"Gerardo is 44 years old. He is married and has 3 children that range in age from 9 to 20 years. He says that his stationary, printing and photocopying business arose from his desire to take care of himself and his family, have a better standard of living, independence and use his skills and knowledge in a productive fashion. That was how he began studying for a career remotely via the Internet, bought his first computer and then a printer, where he could print out study modules, copies for family and the community which needed his services and gave an outlet to his innate altruism. Later he made this into his business and decided to expand, making contact with the human resources staff of the university where he was studying online and began to offer the printed modules to his fellow students, making their college career cheaper. Not content with this, he contacted the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, via its advisor, in order to receive advice and economic support in expanding his business in an organised way, buying stationary in bulk, cabinets and other accessories with which to realize the potential capacity of his business and in the future achieve the goal of having the distance learning university adopt his online advertising and realize his dreams of growing his business.\r\n\r\nGerardo is a very disciplined and active man. He works in a chain store, studies by distance learning and has run the business described for 5 years. His business financial statements reflect his good management, liquidity, as there is no debt, and profitability expressed as a positive value as is normal with this type of business. His income comes from two major sources: his business and his job as a company employee. \r\n\r\nToday, his good relationship with his surroundings has impressed the university at which he studies and brought about their recommendation for him to join the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo in order to obtain the capital to expand his infrastructure. The end goal is to obtain a contract to print modules every semester for the students. This is precisely the reason he is approaching credikiva as he needs to buy stationary in bulk and a computor to expand the infrastructure of his business in accordance with the university's requirements so that Gerardo gets the contract.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":861398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

He now lives alone in his own house in the district of San Pedro de Cajas. Inspite of his family problems, Cesar continues to work as a craftsman, in different mediums. For example he makes: floor mats, alpaca ponchos as well as decorations and handicrafts. To make his textiles he needs 6 different looms of differing sizes. \"This business is very profitable because to make the ponchos I invest $48 per kilo of alpaca wool and produce 4 ponchos per kilo. I sell them as 160 soles each,\" he says. In addition to using alpaca wool he also uses sheep's wool and synthetic wool, but they are not in high demand. Parallel to this work, he makes fireworks: rockets, skyrockets and roman candles, etc., which he sells at a minimum price of 1000 soles, \" I earn very well but it has its risks as if you don't know how to calculate precisely the amount of chemicals needed you can cause a fire and explosions,\" says Cesar. Kenyi, his 13 year old son, always comes to visit him. He is the one that helps him with his work, for this reason, Cesar yearns to have another business selling ceramics and china to give his younger children a better education. With your help, Cesar will be able to get a loan with MFP for the first time. In turn, he agrees to be punctual with his repayments. Cesar is grateful in advance for the support. One of his goals is to open a ceramics and china shop and for it he will buy merchandise from the city of Huancayo and he will sell it to the tourists who visit his area. In addition he will invest in the purchase of alpaca wool and a few consumables with which to make his fireworks.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":906900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives in Ica, Peru. Ica is located in the Sechura Desert, around four hours south of Lima, the country's capital. Ica is celebrated by Peruvians as \"La Tierra del Sol\" [\"The Land of the Sun\"]. It is also known for its frequent earthquakes (8.0 in 2007 and 6.9 in 2011), its production of grapes, asparagus and olives, and perhaps above all, as the source of the traditional national beverage of Peru: pisco. The borrower's home and business are located in this hot and arid place. \r\n\r\nIn her free time, she likes to read. As is well known, Peru is noted for having the most delicious food in the world, and one of the dishes that Rosa likes a lot is \"Tallarines Rojos\u201d [\"Red Noodles\"]. Rosa attended school up to the fifth year of secondary school. She would have liked to study to become a secretary. She is married, and her husband also works very hard to get ahead. He works transporting marine plants. Rosa reports that he is her \"right arm,\" and although some days they are not together due to her husband's work, they are always united and support each other in everything. Together they have 2 children, aged 24 and 19, whom they are helping to get ahead with great effort and sacrifice: both are studying at the university. \r\n\r\nRosa works selling beverages (soft drinks, water, etc.). She dedicates herself to this work for 6 hours each day. Her father inspired her to go into this type of business. In one day, Rosa can serve approximately 15 to 20 customers, and this allows her to earn some 90 Peruvian soles per day; on a good day she can earn up to 660 soles. This helps her take care of some extra household expenses and also invest in her business. She believes that her business is going well for her thanks to the good treatment she gives her customers as well as her friendly personality. \r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since with the help provided to her she will be able to buy merchandise for her business. This improvement will help her offer a greater variety of products and earn a better income. Thus, in a few months, she will be able to save up enough to fulfill her great dream: opening her own store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":970361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Ocote sends out polluting smoke and provides poor lighting, besides being a health, security and environmental hazard due to smoke emissions and deforestation. \n\nDagoberto is 58 years old and his wife is very excited on acquiring a solar home system and providing their three children with an inadequate environment for studying in their home. Dagoberto works in the field, mainly with sugar cane. He processes the sugar cane by grinding it and sells the liquid sugar in the near commercial center. He processes it with a yoke and cattle, and Dagoberto mentioned the best time to do this is 3-5 a.m. because working the cattle during the day causes exhaustion in the animals due to the heat. It is very common to have to work during the night in the summer and with poor lighting that ocote pine gives, many community members have had accidents.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":303979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

He has two daughters, one in first grade and a 20-day-old newborn. He has worked in the Bank Services department of the Banco de Finanzas de Juigalpa for four years. His 25-year-old wife is not working while she studies in the university. In addition to his salary, Milciades earns a bonus of C$3,600, receives an additional US$100 a month from a brother who lives in the United States, and also earns some money selling the cell phones his brother sends him. He is requesting this loan in order to buy bars for the windows of his house to give his family greater security. The windows are made of aluminum and glass and are very fragile.

She works to complete orders that her customers purchase in advance, and always attends to her customers with her typical kindness and charisma.\r\n\r\nOne of Rosario\u2019s dreams that she hopes to achieve is to set up her own tailoring shop complete with new sewing machines\u2014exchanging her old sewing machines for new ones.\r\n\r\nRosario will use this loan of 1,000.00 soles to purchase different types and colors of fabric by the meter, along with supplies she uses such as scissors, large spools of thread of various colors, needles (some for hand stitching, some for her machine), pins, and buttons.  \r\n\r\nRosario now feels like she is a very accomplished woman who wants to achieve and make her dreams a reality.  She is grateful for the help that the Manuela Ramos organization gave her in starting her business, and for the help Manuela Ramos has given to many other women who want to grow their businesses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":353148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing different types and colors of fabric by the meter ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-07-17T06:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:17:00Z","rounded_local_amount":176.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63206193},{"amount":58.21,"local_amount":166.34,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":175.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635454},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":176.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074540},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":166.99,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":176.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989872},{"amount":58.21,"local_amount":166.35,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:40:36Z","rounded_local_amount":175.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834813},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:44Z","rounded_local_amount":176.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726740}],"funded_date":"2009-07-17T14:08:07Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":126396,"name":"Jacqueline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacqueline is a widow and 37 years old.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She lives in the Quiroga neighborhood of Bogot\u00e1, the capital of Colombia. She is married and has 7 children aged 14 to 33. Ana's biggest satisfaction is serving and providing customers with sanitary and well prepared food made by her and her employee. That is how her restaurant  \u201cRestaurante y comidas r\u00e1pidas Arch\u00edes 70\u201d has no competition in the area. At present, she is using a loan of  $1.800.000 to buy the necessary raw materials and ingredients to prepare this food: grains, dairy, edibles, beef and chicken as well as some tools for cleanliness and sanitation for the locale.  \r\n  \r\nAna started her restaurant in the year 2008 but she has had experience in this activity for 15 years. Her parents and relatives have had this type of business and she has been close to it since then. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a chain of restaurants that stand out with the quality of their processes and to generate more sources of employment. Another dream is to make her daughters into professionals in the areas they really like. The hardest part about deciding to start her business was the expectation of having the necessary economic resources to do it.   Now her biggest challenge is remodelling the restaurant, giving it an air of modernity more attractive to customers.  This way, when they arrive to consume the products, they will feel at ease and always wanting to return. Ana likes the neighborhood where she has lived for 25 years because it treats its people well, she considers it safe, and because it has in its schools, sports clubs  and in its church a real and potential market.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.

At that point in his life,  he became involved in business with the aim of generating enough income to continue his schooling.  Unfortunately, he did not continue.  He therefore decided to make business his career and thanks to God, he has achieved greatly in business.  He has been able to build a house, where he presently lives, and can now take good care of his home.  \r\n\r\nWorking 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about Le 900,000 every month from this business.  He serves the Makama community, where he sees over 30 customers each day.  His business is popular because he is the only person selling pharmaceutical products in his area.  He would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000 to purchase more pharmaceutical products -- ampicilin (100 cartons @ 120,000), pinoplex (5 cartons @ Le180,000), etc. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 300,000.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, he plans to take this loan, which will help him greatly as additional capital, and realize more profit so that he can give a quality education to his children and take good care of his wife.

y cumplirlos, por eso hace 5 a\u00f1os inicio con su negocio de papeler\u00eda y mercer\u00eda en uno de los ejidos cercanos a la ciudad, por que vio que seria una mejor opci\u00f3n de tener mayores ingresos al colocarlo en un lugar donde no hay mucha competencia. Jose Eduardo comenta que todos los d\u00edas sale de su trabajo hacia el ejido y hace 15 a 20 minutos en llegar pero esta teniendo resultados favorables y sobre todo en lo econ\u00f3mico para su familia. \n\nEl negocio cuenta con variedad de producto de papeler\u00eda, mercer\u00eda, regalos y servicio de internet para cualquier persona a un precio accesible. Para Jos\u00e9 Eduardo es muy importante mantener  su negocio con mercanc\u00eda variada para que sus clientes encuentren lo que necesiten ya que por la lejan\u00eda es muy dif\u00edcil de conseguir, por ello el pr\u00e9stamo lo utilizara para comprar cuadernos l\u00e1pices, plumas, marcadores, mochilas, listones, y equipo de c\u00f3mputo que este en mejores condiciones; de esta manera sus ventas incrementaran y su negocio ser\u00e1 prosperado.\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 Eduardo is a hardworking man who likes to set goals for himself and accomplish them.  Because of this, five years ago he started his stationery and variety shop in one of the \u201cejidos\u201d [system of cooperative land tenure] near the city because he saw that it was a better option for earning higher income to establish it in a place where there was little competition.  Jos\u00e9 Eduardo comments that he leaves work daily and heads to the ejido; it\u2019s a 15 to 20 minute trip but he\u2019s having favorable results above all for his family\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nThe business has a variety of paper goods, merchandise, gifts and Internet access service for anyone at an accessible price.  For Jos\u00e9 Eduardo it\u2019s important to keep his business stocked with a good variety of merchandise so that his customers can find whatever they need because it\u2019s hard for them to get things due to the distances involved.  Because of this, he\u2019ll use the loan to buy notebooks, pencils, pens, markers, backpacks, ribbon and computer equipment that\u2019s in better condition so that he can increase sales and his business will continue to make progress.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":879602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy notebooks, pencils, backpacks and computer equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acuna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"29.3 -100.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2011-09-27T23:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8396.05,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":680.78},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":733.21},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":789.68},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":850.49},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":916},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":986.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1062.52},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1144.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1232.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.68},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.78},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.31},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.09},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.18},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50.68,"local_amount":680.78,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:45:07Z","rounded_local_amount":707.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238581122},{"amount":54.58,"local_amount":733.21,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":762.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244539418},{"amount":58.78,"local_amount":789.68,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":821.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250750074},{"amount":63.31,"local_amount":850.49,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":884.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257392082},{"amount":68.19,"local_amount":916,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-17T07:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":952.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263704483},{"amount":73.44,"local_amount":986.54,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270008703},{"amount":79.09,"local_amount":1062.52,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1104.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276617885},{"amount":85.18,"local_amount":1144.35,"processed_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T13:38:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1189.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283109801},{"amount":91.75,"local_amount":1232.48,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:45:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1281.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287044330}],"funded_date":"2011-09-28T15:23:37Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:45:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":344446,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther, 42 years old, is married and has five children, three of whom are in school.

is a woman who is very dedicated to her work. Her tenacity and perseverance have allowed her to pull through, overcoming different obstacles that have arisen in her life. She is a mother of four, and from Kitale, a remote town in the Rift valley province of Kenya. \n\nBeatrice has spent the past 10 years of her life farming. She sells eggs, milk and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in a personal business to make ends meet. Beatrice is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities she involves herself in; poultry farming is closest to her heart. \n\nBeatrice wants to diversify and start a business selling cereals. She is requesting a loan to buy cereals to sell. The Kitale area has a ready market for cereals, but the problem is that there are no cereal suppliers. With your loan, Beatrice will be able to sell cereal to the local market and to her neighbors.

She lives with her mother and three adult children; 20, 22, and 24 years old. She runs a small restaurant where she sells sandwiches, rice and meat, other dishes, and juices. She runs this business from home, and most of her clients live in her neighborhood. She has previously received three loans from Esperanza; this will be her fourth loan. With these loans she has been able to invest in a freezer and gas cylinder. Today she probably sells twice as much as she did before receiving her first loan in June of 2007. She would like to expand her business even further and hopes that one day she will be able to employ another person to help run the business. She thinks that her neighborhood is ready for a larger cafeteria. She would also like to make some home improvements and adds that she would like to find a

Leur bonne organisation et leur d\u00e9vouement dans les activit\u00e9s de transformation leurs ont valu un appui de l\u2019US AID \u00e0 travers des s\u00e9choirs et une machine de collage de sachets.\nAinsi dans le souci de mieux rentabiliser leurs activit\u00e9s, elles ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019approcher Soro Yiriwaso qu\u2019elles ont connu \u00e0 travers l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Artisans de Markala. Apr\u00e8s avoir bien rembours\u00e9s les 2  pr\u00eats  pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents elles sont \u00e0 leur 3\u00e8me  pr\u00eat de groupe (pr\u00eat solidaire).\nCe pr\u00eat  sera utilis\u00e9 pour acheter, 10 sacs de sel de cuisine, 50kg de laye, 5 sacs d\u2019oignon dont une partie est s\u00e9ch\u00e9e au s\u00e9choir avant la vente et un sac d\u2019arachide qui serait transform\u00e9 en p\u00e2te. Elles s\u2019approvisionnent hebdomadairement au march\u00e9 de Diamarabougou  pour tous ces condiments ci dessus cit\u00e9s. Elles revendent en d\u00e9tail, au comptant et \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit au march\u00e9 de Diamarabougou et \u00e0 domicile  \u00e0 une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e essentiellement de femmes. \nElles comptent r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice mensuel moyen de 11.000FCA qui sera utilis\u00e9 pour acheter du savon et subvenir aux d\u00e9penses de nutrition de la famille.\n Leur ambition est de pr\u00e9parer les trousseaux de mariage de leurs filles.\n","en":"The 4 members of the Dj\u00e8kadi group are all married, are on average 38 years old with 5 children, and live in monogamous households in the Rails ko area of Markala (4th administrative region of Mali). Living in the same area, the members of the group met each other in a traditional mutual assistance association named Parissain.\r\nThis group of women runs as a revenue-generating business the sale of rice and the processing of vegetables (onions and tomatoes). Their good organizational skills and their dedication to their business  of processing vegetables earned them support from US AID in the form of dehydrators and a machine to seal bags.\r\nThus, with the hope of increasing the profitability of their businesses, these women decided to approach the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, which they found out about through the General Assembly of Artisans in Markala. After having repaid their 2 previous loans without problems, they are seeking their 3rd group loan.\r\nThis loan will be used to buy 10 bags of cooking salt, 50 kg of milk, 5 bags of onions, of which one portion is dried in the dehydrator before sale, and 1 bag of peanuts, which will be converted to paste. They supply themselves weekly at the Diamarabougou market for all the condiments mentioned above. They sell at retail, in cash or on credit, in the Diamarabougou market and at home to a clientele composed primarily of women.\r\nThey intend to realize an average monthly profit of 11,000 FCA, which will be used to buy soap and meet the nutritional needs of their families. Their ambition is to prepare bridal trousseaus for their daughters.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":273347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy food condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abibatou              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aich\u00e9                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":93644,"name":"Francisco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Francisco se dedica a la confecci\u00f3n y venta de chalecos, faldas los cuales vende en el altiplano, en estas fechas es cuando tiene mas demanda para estas prendas, vive en casa propia su esposa falleci\u00f3 tienes cuatro hijos los cuales ya son independientes su casa queda ubicada en la Calle Ayacucho, zona Puerto Camacho de la ciudad de El Alto.\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito lo destinara para la compra tela por cantidad hilo encajes que necesita para la confecci\u00f3n de las prendas. \n \nEs el primer  cr\u00e9dito con Impro, la evaluaci\u00f3n realizada lo califica para otorgarle el cr\u00e9dito.\n","en":"Francisco makes and sells sweaters and skirts, which he sells in the Bolivian Altiplano.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

(0) is a 32-year-old woman living in the town of Manono Tai.  She is married and has 2 infant-aged children.  To make a living, Falelua owns & operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community.  Falelua has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Falelua joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Falelua is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Falelua is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Falelua plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":382962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She is single and has 3 children, all of whom are independent.  Mar\u00eda Delicia is a hard-working and tenacious woman who decided to set up her own carbonated beverage business.  She tends to her customers herself with neither a schedule nor a boss.  She tells us that she began with a capital investment of 200 soles and bought 5 cases of soft-drinks.  When she saw that she did well, little by little she began to invest more.  Currently, she has the same business and is well-known by her customers, who are her neighbors, family members and friends.  With this 2000 sol loan she will buy cases of soft-drinks in various flavors, sizes and brands as well as still and sparkling mineral water.

San Antonio\r\nThe 12 members of this communal bank are very enterprising and responsible.  They have demonstrated this during the nine cycles in which they have worked with Edaprospo.  Their prime objective, among others, is to give their loved ones the best.  They put forth great effort everyday in their businesses in order to reach their goal.  What follows is Nancy\u2019s story.\r\n\r\nNancy is 31, and she has three children.  With a husband who gives her all of his support, she started in the world of business.  Since she was very young she has sold tripe as a traveling vendor and prepared food for some of the \u201cmotocarro\u201d (three wheeled motorized vehicles) drivers.  It was through these drivers that she found out that the motocarro business was profitable.\r\n\r\nShe then decided to get a motocarro with the income from her sales and what she could save from her husband\u2019s salary.  That way they rented one.  When she saw that this business was profitable, she decided to buy another motocarro.  She later came to have two more.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw the need for an immediate loan, she did not know where to go.  It was through a neighbor that she found out about the benefits that Edaprospo offers.  She used her first loan for the maintenance and operation of her motocarros.  Thanks to the loan with Edaprospo, her income was improving.  It was a big help and of great use.  \r\n\r\nBut, as time passed she felt the competition in this business.  She decided to sell her motocarros and invest in a new business, renting rooms in her house.  She currently has one motocarro that she got by selling her previous motocarros after about one year of use.\r\n\r\nShe plans on using her next loan from Edaprospo on the construction of her house in order to make the people who want to rent a room more comfortable.  What she has in mind is having a comfortable house to give her family a better quality of life.  She also wants to give her children a good education so that they will become good professionals.  These are plans for the future, and she is sure she will accomplish them.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2250,"image":{"id":506038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Build rooms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enma Gina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olinda Yola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha Giovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Llerlit","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermenegilda Trinidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celina Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana Eloina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":562.68,"local_amount":1563,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1580.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933830},{"amount":562.32,"local_amount":1562,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1579.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661443},{"amount":562.68,"local_amount":1563,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1580.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694103},{"amount":562.32,"local_amount":1562,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1579.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877067}],"funded_date":"2010-03-28T00:48:32Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":188726,"name":"Sreypov","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sreypov B.

She is an employee thanks to her husband\u2019s friend who was able to get her into the factory. \r\n\r\nFrom that time on she has made bricks, which are later sold wholesale.  However, she saw that the advantageous thing to do is to buy the bricks that she makes.  Then, she takes them to different cities to sell them for a better price.\r\n\r\nShe currently works half time, which allows her to devote herself to her children.  She thinks that this activity has united her family more.  She receives help from them in making and selling the bricks.  She is very pleased about this.  Later she wishes to have her own land to establish a factory to produce a greater quantity of bricks.\r\n\r\nThis is her ninth loan with MFP.  She is very happy knowing that she has financial support.  She has always demonstrated herself to be responsible with her payments.  It pleases her to be part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible and very supportive people.  Also, she is grateful to the people who will make the loan she is requesting possible.  It will be very useful to the progress of her business.

She is 38 years old, married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Florentina owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling food and daily use products in the local community. Florentina has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Florentina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Florentina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and to provide working capital. This will be the second loan that Florentina has taken out from HSPFI.

She supplies her business from wholesalers in Bamako and sells her goods retail in Ouelessebougou and at the various weekly markets, for cash and credit, to a customer base made up mostly of women.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to make a monthly profit of 25,000 CFA francs, a figure that will allow her to repay the loan and to reinvest in her business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":715364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou Koulikoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiaratou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":34138.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201361239},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34138.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226520},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":34138.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301361},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:51:53Z","rounded_local_amount":34138.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580933},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:10Z","rounded_local_amount":34138.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750757},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":34138.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120073}],"funded_date":"2011-03-01T23:44:29Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessalyn Pinneo","image":603028}},{"id":278869,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary was born in 1964. She is a widow and blessed with four kids, none below 15 years of age. She is a hard working lady and has faced many challenges in life, such as being a widow at a young age, ill health and being unable to take care of her children. Due to all of these challenges, she made up her mind to become a GHAPE member in the year 2009.\r\n\r\nIn this same year, Mary received her pioneer loan of 40,000 XAF, and the repayment was done promptly. With her new loan of 75,0000 XAF, she plans to buy seedlings. She is sure the business will succeed because she has been doing this business for a long period of time. She has good land for farming.\r\n\r\nHer neighbors are happy for the business she is doing because it will reduce their distances to the market and because they will be able to buy from her at a cheaper cost. She plans to use the profit from the business to plow back into the business, care for her son and provide good medical attention for herself and her son. She prefers borrowing from GHAPE because of the social services GHAPE offers, and because the method of repayment is comfortable. \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:  \r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works toward the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its

She lives in her own home together with her two beloved children: 21 year-old Jorge and 23 year-old Miguel, who she would like to provide with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThrough her hard work, Mar\u00eda has managed to ensure that her farm provides her with the produce she needs to support her family.  Before the sun is up, she leaves home and walks for almost an hour to reach her farmland where she grows potatoes, corn and beans, products which she later takes to sell in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.\r\n\r\nWhat Mar\u00eda most enjoys about her work is cultivating her land since she feels that she is putting it to good use.  Mar\u00eda has been in this business for 36 years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her produce to Tarma since the sacks are very heavy and they tire her out.  Over time, Mar\u00eda would like to set up a grocery store which would help her to improve her finances.\r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's ninth loan through MFP.  She is very happy to be able to access this loan and she would like to thank all the people who will make it possible for her to obtain the money that she needs.  Mar\u00eda is a very well-respected member of her community bank because of the order that she brings to their meetings.

Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells shoes, toiletries, and other goods for women.  She is married and the mother of a family.  She has been in this business for five years.  With the revenues derived from her work, she helps meet day-to-day expenses just like her husband does, and thus, she frees herself from marital supervision.  With this loan she's requesting, she wants to diversify the types of fruit she sells in order to increase her revenues and therefore to assert her role as head of household.  <br

She has three children, ages 12, 10 and 2. Like many of CIDRE's borrowers, Miriam is a dairy cow farmer. Her farm is located in the Mantecato-Machamarca district outside of the city of Cochabamba. \r\n<p>\r\nMiriam is a very hard worker because, when she was little, her father died and she was left alone with her siblings in the care of her mother. Because of the financial strain, she and her siblings never finished high school. This was really hard for Miriam because her whole life she had dreamed of becoming a primary school teacher. She loves working with children and she has a lot of patience around children. She loves her own children so much \u2013 they are her reason for working. Miriam and her husband work hard to make sure that their children have a good education and will be able to finish high school and attend university.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan from CIDRE, Miriam will purchase construction materials to build a stable for her livestock. Miriam hopes that this loan will help her to increase her milk production and protect her cows from illness, as they currently do not have a place to stay dry when it rains.

This is 35-year-old Valeria from Dar es Salaam. She is married with three children between the ages of 7 and 11. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting three dependents who are orphans. Valeria has been running a business selling traditional Arican cloth called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric, often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile--the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. Valeria works at the business for 13 hours per day, seven days a week. Valeria currently earns about 200 USD from her business, and she is requesting a loan of 250 USD to buy additional traditional African cloths. In the future, she plans to increase the amount of commodities in her business. Valeria thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":212536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase traditional African cloth in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-17T00:50:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valeria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-31T11:22:43Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:22:14Z","rounded_local_amount":30137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348061},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:16:00Z","rounded_local_amount":30137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970644},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":30137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886861},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":30137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436121},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":30137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130394},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":30137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027200},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":30137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613240},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":30137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010323},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":30137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232634},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:56:14Z","rounded_local_amount":30137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664450}],"funded_date":"2008-10-17T11:22:43Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:56:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":73196,"name":"Jamila Riaz Masih Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jamila baji is the wife of R.

Su dedicaci\u00f3n  le ha generado un importante n\u00famero de clientes a los que vende a cr\u00e9dito y recupera su cartera en plazos quincenales aunque tambi\u00e9n vende de contado de acuerdo al monto del pedido.\n\nUna de las dificultades que manifiesta es que su capital de trabajo no responde al numero de pedidos requeridos por su clientela, por eso recurre a la financiaci\u00f3n pues conoce su probabilidad de acceder a cr\u00e9ditos porque ha construido una buena historia crediticia en la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con quien viene trabajando desde  el a\u00f1o 2007. Mar\u00eda manifiesta que con los cr\u00e9ditos y el control de su endeudamiento, aprendido en la capacitaci\u00f3n empresarial, ha logrado estabilizar sus ingresos. \nSu pr\u00f3xima meta es adquirir vitrinas, diversificar su mercanc\u00eda y poner una miscel\u00e1nea, pues considera que es bien reconocida en el suroccidente de Barranquilla y sus clientes necesitan un sitio fijo donde ubicarla, para ello se prepara observando su mercado  y estando atenta a nuevas oportunidades de productos que le generen mayor margen de utilidad. Su m\u00e1ximo desaf\u00edo es tener una casa propia para independizarse, pero es una meta a largo plazo en la que no deja de pensar. Ella reconoce que desarrollar un negocio ha ido de la mano con su crecimiento personal, el cual se ve reflejado en la seguridad de si misma. \n \nEl cr\u00e9dito inmediato, por valor de $500.000 lo va a emplear en surtir el negocio con cosm\u00e9ticos, multiusos, lencer\u00eda  acordes a los pedidos de su clientela,  de esta manera  es oportuna y ofrece  un mejor servicio manteni\u00e9ndolos satisfechos.  \n","en":"Mar\u00eda left Sinc\u00e9 \u2013 C\u00f3rdoba, where her parents lived, and went to her brother\u2019s house in the city of Barranquilla to look for new horizons to be able to help her parents.  She started working different jobs, and at the same time she received training to be able to improve herself.  She took first aid courses, which later helped her get work taking care of elderly people.  As her health deteriorated because of her work schedule, she needed to look for other work that would generate income and accommodate her recuperation.  \r\n\r\nThat is how she started selling products by catalog three years ago.  She sells to customers in the Carlos Meisel neighborhood and the surrounding areas, which are known for their wide range of informal businesses.  She makes pre-sales visits from person to person.  She shows her products through specialized guides provided by the business she is affiliated with.  She knows and explains the benefits of each product to generate its purchase.  Her dedication has generated an important number of customers.  She sells to them on credit, and she collect payments biweekly.  She also sells for cash depending on the amount of the order.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties she has is that her working capital does not correspond to the number of customer orders.  That is why she turns to the loan.  She knows her probability of getting loans because she has built a good credit history with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She has been working with them since 2007.  Mar\u00eda demonstrates with her loans and the control of her debt that she has learned, through her business training, to stabilize her income.\r\n\r\nHer next goal is to get display cases, diversify her merchandise, and establish a general store.  She is well known in the southwestern part of Barranquilla.  Her customers need a fixed place to find her.  To that end, she prepares by observing her market and being attentive to new opportunities for new products that will generate a larger margin of profit.  \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge is to have her own house to become independent.  It is a long term goal, which she does not stop thinking about.  She recognizes that the development of her business goes hand in hand with her personal growth.  That is a reflection of her self-confidence.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan for 500,000 COP to stock her business with cosmetics, multipurpose items, and lingerie according to customer orders.  This is expedient, and she will offer better service, which will keep her customers satisfied\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She is 42 years old and is a widowed mother of 2 sons, ages 22 and 20.  Her younger son attends school.  In addition to her sons she also supports two grandchildren who live with her.  She is able to save 1.000.00 MT per month. \r\n\r\nHelena left Gaza when her husband was transferred to Vila de Namaacha on the border with Swaziland as part of the Border Patrol.  Years later her husband died, leaving her with two children to raise.  Life was very difficult for Helena.  Then her son-in-law gave her money to start her own business.  She started a business exchanging empty cans acquired in Maputo and reselling them on the border.  In exchange she received lagerins, plastic sandals and baskets, which she resold in the capital and vice versa. \r\n\r\nHer business was growing and she decided to change activities, as that one was very tiring.  In 2000 she was able to set up a booth in the Central Market where she sells basic goods.  Her best products are peanuts, tomatoes, coconut, and cooking oil obtained in Swaziland for the following prices:  a sack for 1.320.00 MT, a box for 500.00 MT, a sack for 500.00 MT and a box for 450.00 MT respectively.  She travels twice a week because in addition to selling in the Central Market she sells in the Informal Market (shoprite) on Thursdays and Saturdays. She makes a profit of 3.000.00MT. \r\n\r\nThis is Helena's third loan with Hluvuku and second with Kiva.  The first loan for 7.000 was used to restart her business.  The second for 8.000.00MT was used to purchase more merchandise.  This 13.000.00 MT will be used for the same purpose.  She is confident that she is going to pay back the loan without any problems.  In addition to being a businesswoman she is the secretary of the Bairro 25 de junho neighborhood, for which she receives tips every three months, and she is hoping to build her own sales counter at her home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

He plants rice and also raises pigs. He has been living on the lands for about 30 years. He primarily relies on rice to feed his wife and two kids, aged 15 and 9. Whenever he is in need of extra capital he goes and sells some pigs in the local market. This has been a great fallback for him and his family. He plans to use most of the money from the loan in rice production. He will purchase pesticides and invest in machinery to help in the collection process. <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Jorge is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":25067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T17:48:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-29T20:59:32Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":925,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:21Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21392},{"amount":192,"local_amount":192,"processed_date":"2007-07-08T09:15:20Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":192,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":30100},{"amount":133,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T09:15:23Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40152},{"amount":133,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2007-09-08T09:15:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51950},{"amount":133,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2007-10-08T09:15:07Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":64512},{"amount":133,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2007-11-08T10:15:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":78077},{"amount":127,"local_amount":127,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T10:15:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93283}],"funded_date":"2007-04-15T20:59:32Z","paid_date":"2007-12-08T10:15:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11748,"name":"Narinj","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Narinj N.
