For now, they are ascertaining the funds to open a soda shop in their home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":271924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buy wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-02-17T19:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20393233},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978384}],"funded_date":"2009-02-17T20:33:57Z","paid_date":"2009-05-29T08:17:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jay Osborne","image":883556}},{"id":93304,"name":"Korng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Korng S., 47, is a widow who lives with her two children in the Kampong Cham province.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is a 32-year-old single mother and has a business selling cooked food in the evenings from the front porch of her home.  Ana lives in the city of Pucallpa.\r\n\r\nAna has been working with Manuela Ramos, a Kiva field partner, for about two years. She belongs to the \"Las Romanticas II\" communal bank. Ana used her first loan of 300 soles (about $100) to purchase food for her restaurant business and also to purchase shoes which she sells to Pucallpa's prison.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She produces milk to sell to a company that markets a wide range of dairy products. Her husband helps her with the production of milk and also grows a variety of crops, such as bananas and hearts of palm, in the Chapare area.\r\n\r\nFrancisca lives in the Itocta area of Cochabamba. As her home is far from the center of the city it is difficult for her to go to banks in search of loans. Luckily, CIDRE took the initiative to go to her area and discovered that there were many small producers of raw milk in the area who were having problems because the price of feed for milk cows had increased in the last month due to poor weather conditions in Bolivia. Therefore, Francisca will use this loan to purchase feed for her dairy cows so that they do not suffer from a lack of food and their production will not be affected. \r\n\r\nFrancisca's dream is to continue producing milk as she has always done, to see her children and grandchildren have bright futures, and to one day have earned enough to be able to leave her children an inheritance that will help them in life, as conditions in her country are becoming more and more difficult.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kris Vickery, Kiva

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner.\r\n\r\nMarta is excited to be taking her third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business selling jewelry. She intends to use the loan capital to purchase underwear in order to expand her offerings. She will use the profits to complete construction on her home and to invest in her children's education.

She lives in Purok 5, Barangay Bonawon, Siaton, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing  business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $290. \r\n\r\nJulieta is borrowing 30,000 PHP so that she can purchase fishing gear and equipment. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Julieta aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She starts working very early, at approximately 4 a.m., when she is already up and ready to knead the dough and make the breads that everyone in her neighborhood enjoys. She is a very skilled baker, and that's because she learned the trade from her father since she was very young. What she enjoys most about her work is making the breads, which she does with a lot of care. She has had this job for five years, and the thing she considers to be the most difficult is getting up so early every morning, since for her weekends and holidays don't exist. In the future, her goal is to have a store where she could sell the items she bakes herself. This is her third loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she wants to have the funds to repay it, so she is ready to save day by day.

She lives with Raul, her husband of 20 years. They have 3 children but only take care of 2 of them in their own house which is located in the annex of San Pedro de Sa\u00f1o. Her main economic activity is farming. She plants corn and potatoes which she tends with great care as she must ensure the quality of her produce as at harvest time the very merchants visit her farm to negotiate for the produce. Her husband's help is crucial as together they make decisions to confront any difficulties such as a lack of labourers or the pests that afflict her crops. As she is a country woman she also keeps livestock, breeding 2 cows which give her milk that she subsequently sells to people of her area. She now wants to buy more farmland because she has plans to continue planting in large quantities. She belongs to the communal bank \"San Pedro\" and this is the 7th loan with MFP. She hopes for your collaboration so as to pursue her goals. She also promises once more to make her repayments. In addition, she likes being a part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible people and very united.

The program allows poor people like Levani to get a chance for starting or re-starting business. Levani plans to be involved in agricultural activity and set up a poultry-farm.

resell the summer time. \r\nShe also works at home making yarn from wool.\r\nShe would be happy to try using a loan as source of investment. \r\n\r\n <p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva

They are taking their first loan with Esperanza International, Kiva's partner. In view of the slow movement of the economy in the past few months, many people have decided to become self-employed as an alternative to unemployment. Hato Mayor is one of the provinces with the lowest population in Dominican Republic, and many of its inhabitants are forced to perform their work activities elsewhere, or commute to other provinces to work. This results in an additional burden to their businesses and families, as on many occasions, our clients have to be away from home either for work or to restock their inventory. \r\n\r\nAltagracia S. has been appointed as group representative. She has 4 children; the oldest is 19 and the youngest is 6. Her group mates recognize her as a leader and trust her to do a good job in keeping the group together. Altagracia has set up a clothing sales business, so she will use her loan to buy new clothes to sell. For the present time, she will sell from her own home and visit her acquaintances with her merchandise. She hopes to eventually set up a store where her customers can come to her instead. She also wants to start building a house with her sales profits and be able to help her children acquire a college education. \r\n\r\nPlease help us support this group of new micro entrepreneurs

He is 35 years old and has lived in his hometown since birth. In 2004 he started a food trading business with his brother, but in 2007, the two ended their partnership. Now, with the help of his wife, Nergui runs his business from a rented container shop at the local market. Thanks to their hard work, the business has been very successful. This success has much improved the family's quality of life and enabled them to buy their own home. One of the main reasons for his business' success is Nergui's strong customer service practices.

A farmer for 12 years, he has mastered farming techniques and always achieves good agricultural harvests, especially when the climatic conditions are favorable. The good yield, Ubaid realizes, is in general due to the seeds he uses. His current seeds have already been used for 3 years and are beginning to lose their productivity and need to be replaced by new ones. However, the lack of investment capital is his current problem. For this, Ubaid is asking for a loan of $3000 USD to buy selected seeds and fertilizers to revitalize his business. The improvement of his yield will give him the financial means to meet the needs of his family.\r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva, seeking a loan of 1,500,000 leones each to enable them to expand their businesses. With their loan, they will be able to add more stock to their businesses and make more sales and profit. Consequently, they will be able to improve their standard of living, send their children to school and feed and clothe them. \r\n\r\nMohamed D. (pictured on the left) is the leader of this group.

Originally, they used to rent the premises in which they made their bread but now they own their own premises.\r\n\r\nPiedad is requesting this loan to buy a mixer and some trays on which she can place her bread.  Her customers are happy because she always serves them with kindness and they enjoy the special flavor of her home-made bread.  At the moment of requesting this loan, Piedad feels happy because she knows that she will get her mixer which will help her to increase her production.\r\n\r\nPiedad is 40 years old and studied up to the third year of high school.  She is married and has two daughters.  Her eldest daughter is 20 years old and married, and her younger daughter is 13.  Piedad would like to use the profits from her business to continue providing her daughter with an education so that she can eventually become a professional.  This group has 10 members."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":695739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy electrical appliances for making bread","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Estado de Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":158,"posted_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Piedad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ilse","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1540},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1579},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1620},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1662},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1704},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1748},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1793},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1839},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1886},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1934},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1984},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2035},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2087},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2141},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2196},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2252}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.9},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.35},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.42},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.92},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.74},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.77},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.99},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.28},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.2},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.83},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1293.73,"local_amount":15370,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":15517.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195982126},{"amount":856.98,"local_amount":10182,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":10279.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201264174},{"amount":374.29,"local_amount":4448,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4490.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206131080}],"funded_date":"2011-02-02T01:55:09Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:39:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":270351,"name":"Genara Marcelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Genara tiene su actividad econ\u00f3mica que acopio y pesca artesanal.

from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! This is 39 year old Martha K.. She is single with four children, between the ages of 9 and 25.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> In 2001, Martha established a charcoal and small retail business. Working seven days a week for nine to twelve hours a day and assisted by her children, she earns about $225.00 per month from this business. Martha now requires a loan to purchase additional stock in bulk. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately $170.00. In the future, Martha also plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that these small, black, and dirty pieces of dry earth are important not just to charcoal sellers but to their customers, who rely on charcoal to cook their meals. Many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags, or kerosene to light them.

De peque\u00f1a realizaba las labores agr\u00edcolas y el cuidado de las vacas, ahora con su propia familia, siembra mayormente espinaca; pero le es m\u00e1s rentable comprar por chacras porque al comprar se puede calcular por un aproximado de 40 canastas, pero al cosechar saca entre 60 o 70 canastas, esto le permite pagar peones y transporte de los productos, as\u00ed gana un 50 % m\u00e1s de lo invertido.

El dinero  que ha solicitado es para la compra de grandes cantidades de avena para alimentar a sus vacas y que no deje de faltarles la leche, y de ese modo cubran sus gastos familiares. ","en":"Rosmery is 27 years old, has lived with her husband for 9 years and has a son.  At night she sleeps at her home, but prepares food in her mother\u2019s home.  Since she was young she has worked in farming and raising cattle.  Now that she has her own family, she mostly grows spinach.  Spinach is profitable because when you purchase a field and calculate that it will yield about 40 baskets of spinach, it will actually yield between 60-70 baskets during the harvest.  The extra crop allows her to pay workers and to transport her products, and she earns 50% more than she invests.  At the same time, she also works with her mother delivering milk.  For the past 27 years her mother has delivered milk to restaurants and bakeries.  Now Rosmery and her mother alternate weeks\u2014one week Rosmery delivers milk and the next her mother delivers it.  Rosmery is very content with what she does and has plans to increase her spinach crops.  She will also increase her oat crop in order to feed her cows.  Rosmery is an entrepreneurial  member [of the community bank] and very punctual at their programmed meetings.  This is her twelfth loan and she has always been on-time with her payments.  The money she is asking for will be used to buy large quantities of oats to feed to her cows so they will continue producing milk and she can pay for her household expenses.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":272009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy oats to feed to cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-17T22:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.06},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.06},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.06},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.06},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.06},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.06,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":338.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117073},{"amount":104.06,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":338.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011986},{"amount":104.06,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":338.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595571},{"amount":104.06,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":338.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989833},{"amount":104.06,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":338.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210969},{"amount":104.7,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":340.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640472}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T00:02:50Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":93336,"name":"Milka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Milka A. is a 40-year-old mother of 5 children, aged 20, 19, 17, 14, and 8.

His dream is to have a country with greater opportunities for people who want to work. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":342380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"for the purchase of batteries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Caaguaz\u00fa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yomny ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63177534},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602915},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87038990},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:00:11Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96951424},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103793522},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110684291},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-17T09:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118078902},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123915079},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128950794},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136679626},{"amount":54.5,"local_amount":272727.3,"processed_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:20:29Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144714025}],"funded_date":"2009-07-18T03:13:15Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:20:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheila McCormick","image":null}},{"id":122008,"name":"Firdavs","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"I.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

However, most of the financial and emotional investments she had then vanished when her husband died just recently. She spend thousands of money for her husband's medication before the death and even until the burial. Having her only 11-year-old child beside her, Edna realized she has to be strong to restart running her general store business for her child's education and future.\n\nFrom a Php12,000 previously, Edna chose to lessen the amount she will loan now despite her qualification for loaning large amount because she will start all over again and for the first time, without her husband's support. In the near future she believes that she will be able to grow her business again with loans she will be getting from ASHI.

S. (0) is a 29-year-old woman living in the town of Savalalo.  She is married and has 1 infant-aged child.  To make a living, Korina is starting a business venture in the food sector making & selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling baked goods in the local community.  Korina has just started operating this business and earns approximately 300 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Korina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Korina is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Korina is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Korina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":382303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Maynard is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Maynard from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":572114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Baliangao Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maynard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1742.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166855154},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1742.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121865},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1742.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415962},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1742.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182555497},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1742.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188692217},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.65,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:46:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1742.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191431468}],"funded_date":"2010-08-05T01:07:48Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:46:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Misty McNally","image":77472}},{"id":221192,"name":"Sadiatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"il y a plus de 10 ans que cette femme s'est sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans le commerce de tissus et de bazins, elle ma\u00eetrise parfaitement ce march\u00e9. elle fait ce commerce de fa\u00e7on ambulante pour toucher plus de clients; elle s'approvisionne au burkina faso, un pays voisin  et \u00e0 lom\u00e9. le stock actuel de marchandises ne lui permet pas de subvenir aux besoins de ses clients. elle sollicite de WAGES un cr\u00e9dit pour l'achat de divers tissus et divers bazins de diff\u00e9rentes qualit\u00e9s. elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 5 enfants","en":"For over ten years, Mrs. K.

He is still quite young, but he has proven to be a successful entrepreneur with his computer and games shop. He has owned and run this shop for more than three years. With his loan request of $800 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l., he will improve his business and purchase new computers at good prices and he needs this amount to add to his saving to buy them. Those computers will allow him to significantly increase his productivity and also his income. He is positive about his business prospects and plans to further expand. He is hoping to open a new branch of his shop in the coming year. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages them to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen: Ameen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l., we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

She started selling jewelry, handbags and cosmetics that she bought and restyled from her home. Marcel was able to sell items even cheaper than available at the souk market.\r\n\r\nMarcel needed this loan to renovate her workstation and purchase additional stock.  She dreams of continuing to branch out into additional items and utilizing her sewing and artistic skills.

In time, she gained customers and a good reputation for her work. Talat\u2019s children are all studying at school and the next year two of her sons are planning to enter university and need tuition.

The loan will be her 2nd from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

Moreover, he also has a tractor which helps him generate additional income in spring when he plows fields for other farmers in his region. Alexei has been growing vegetables for three years.

Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing, and other items. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory.

She has been struggling to raise these children with the help of her husband. She faces difficulties providing for their school needs, especially payment of their school fees on time. She has successfully borrowed and repaid loans seven times with GHAPE since 2002. She plans to invest this loan in a provision store which will contain rice, beans, palm oil, groundnut oil, savon, magi, salt, and the sale of firewood. She has been in this for a long time now, and success is her watch word. She believes the business will succeed because she has targeted a period where there will be scarcity of firewood and at that time it will be expensive. The loan will help her community because they will be able to buy firewood and other items in her provision store at affordable prices.\r\n\r\nP. will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. Her children\u2019s school needs will be taken care of.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":723944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy palm oil, groundnut oil, rice, savon, firewood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Foncha St, Nkwen, NW.

Marivic was a high school graduate. At present, she is a wife to Jose, a construction worker, and a loving mother to four children. Two of her children are already working, while two are studying in high school. Their family resides in Pasay City. Aside from her family and business, Marivic also spends time attending weekly Bible fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nIn order to make a living, Marivic sells frozen food from house to house in their community in Pasay. She sees this as an effective strategy since it also gives her a way to build relationships with her customers on a more intimate level. She has been doing this by herself for six years now, and earns a monthly net income of Php 9,000.\r\n\r\nTo help continue the operation of her business, Marivic is requesting a loan for Php13,000 to help her increase her sales. She will use this to add more to her stocks of processed meat such as hotdogs and sweet ham, as well as pork and chicken meat. She admits that the loan will definitely boost her capital and will serve as a step toward business growth. According to her, part of the profits will be used to finance the schooling of her children, so the loan benefits not only the business but also her family.\r\n\r\nOne struggle Marivic faces is delayed payments by her customers. Some do not pay in full and leave part of it to debt. Marivic frequently worries about the education of her children, but she fights these struggles and makes sure at the end of the day that she is happy inside out, because a happy family starts with her, the light of their home.  She desires to see her business grow and presently looks for other sources of income. She also prays that her husband and children would have stable jobs and that her two younger children will finish their schooling.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":779633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This is 56 year old Monica M. M. from Mbeya. She is a widow with 8 children, between the ages of 18 and 40. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because their parents cannot care for them.  Monica has been running a bar since 2000. Her bar is a good place to relax with a beer if you manage to finish work early on a Friday afternoon. You can relax on a plastic chair under a tree, with a local beer in hand, the aroma of roasting \u2018mishikaki\u2019  (kebabs made on an open fire) wafting around you, and talk to everyone who happens to wander by.  Monika works at the business for 9 - 12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by two employees. Monica currently earns about 230USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 300USD in order to purchase more drinks in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the range of her business. Monica thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":303452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more drinks in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica M.

At the end of several loan cycles, these savings are returned to Giannina and the other communal bank clients, providing each of them with an additional source of capital to use to improve their business and quality of life.  \r\n<p>\r\nGiannina\u2019s business is buying and selling clothes, which she has been doing for the past 6 years.  She buys her inventory in Lima, Arequipa and Cusco, and then sells the clothes in one of the main markets in Cusco.  Giannina wants a loan to buy new lines of clothing to sell in her market stand and thereby grow her business.\r\n<p>\r\nGiannina appreciates Kiva lenders and thanks you for the loan. She promises to pay the monthly payments on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":451232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy clothing to sell in market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-12-18T16:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giannina Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":117.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":122.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":127.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":132.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.21},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.21,"local_amount":117.75,"processed_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":118.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118034400},{"amount":42.94,"local_amount":122.69,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123872496},{"amount":44.62,"local_amount":127.48,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":128.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905755},{"amount":46.23,"local_amount":132.08,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":132.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633228}],"funded_date":"2009-12-18T18:41:05Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T09:49:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Olson","image":null}},{"id":167387,"name":"Lina Amely","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lina es socia del Banco Comunal Amor Divino.\nLina es soltera, tiene 27 a\u00f1os y 1 hijo, Lina vende materiales de construcci\u00f3n, cuenta con un local para almac\u00e9n y sus ventas los realiza a domicilio, actividad que realiza con la ayuda de su pap\u00e1.\nLina necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1750 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de arena.\nLina sue\u00f1a con aperturar una ferreter\u00eda y tener una tienda de ropa.\n\n","en":"Lina is a member of the Amor Divino communal bank.\r\nLina is 27 years old, single, and has a son.

She lives in her own home and what she most desires is to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nSince she was a little girl, Mar\u00eda has been taught to work hard at everything in order to achieve her goals.  Her business is selling alfalfa and guinea pigs that she grows and raises herself.  In parallel with this, she also works together with her sister making cheese and 'manjar' (a sweetened condensed milk product).  They sell these products in the city of Lima.\r\n\r\nWhat Maria most likes about her work is raising her guinea pigs and she does this with a lot of love.  She has been in this business for 16 years and she considers that the most difficult part of her work is having to constantly travel to Lima with her 'manjar' and cheese orders.  Over time, Mar\u00eda hopes that her business will continue to grow and that it will make her better profits.\r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's 12th loan with MFP and she is ready to make all her repayments on time since she doesn't want to make difficulties for her community bank.  Mar\u00eda is very supportive of the other members of her bank.  She will use the 2,800 Peruvian soles she is requesting to buy more feed for her guinea pigs since this is the business that is making her the best profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":714840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy alfalfa and other feed for her guinea pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-18T14:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":422.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":439.05},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":456.62},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":474.88},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":493.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":513.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.54},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.73},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.15},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.84},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.8},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":154.54,"local_amount":422.17,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":427.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327734},{"amount":160.73,"local_amount":439.05,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":444.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196259},{"amount":167.15,"local_amount":456.62,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":462.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269938},{"amount":173.84,"local_amount":474.88,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":480.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549953},{"amount":179.47,"local_amount":490.27,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":496.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718632},{"amount":189.27,"local_amount":517.01,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":523.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350056}],"funded_date":"2011-02-18T20:42:30Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":278593,"name":"Nelson Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Desempe\u00f1\u00e1ndose como Maestro de Primaria desde el a\u00f1o 1,985  es soltero viaja de le\u00f3n a su centro de trabajo diario, este se\u00f1or ha obtenido 2 financiamientos con la empresa bajo el convenio firmado con dicho colegio, ya que los financiamientos les han ayudado a mejorar su situaci\u00f3n y nivel de vida, ya que la necesidad actual es un tratamiento M\u00e9dico y Mejoramiento de la vivienda antes que entre el invierno.","en":"He has been working as an elementary school teacher since 1985.

","en":"Margarita lives in Atlacahualoya, in the State of Morelos, Mexico.  She is 70 years old, married, and has six children who are all married.\r\n\r\nMargarita owns a grocery store.  She requested this loan to buy soft drinks, Sabrita-brand snacks, soap, bleach, salt, matches, cookies, toilet paper, eggs and sugar with which to stock her store.  She started her business two years ago with some savings which she added to some money her children gave her.  Her son-in-law lent her some shelves to display her merchandise and she bought a refrigerator to keep her soft drinks cold.\r\n\r\nMargarita used to make casserole dishes, pots and pitchers from clay when she lived in San Marcos.  However, she moved because her husband and children came to work on the land in Atlacahualoya.  Margarita's business is important because, although it isn't much, she is prepared for any unforeseen circumstances as she has work.  She also feels happy serving her customers who are her neighbors, visitors and tourists.  She uses her profits to re-stock her store.\r\n\r\nMargarita is planning to grow corn and onions during this rainy season since her husband enjoys working on the land and she likes it when there are ears of corn that she can grill and eat.  Her dreams and hopes are for her family to be well and live happily.\r\n\r\nAtlacahualoya is a beautiful village with land where people work growing onions and corn.  There are market gardens full of green 'guajes' (a type of squash).  Margarita would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Thank you for the loan.

University and has completed her apprenticeship and two years further work. She now wishes to set up an independent practice in Sur Baher in south Jerusalem, not far from her home in Sharfat, where she lives with her husband, an electrical engineer. There are currently two dental practices in Sur Baher but neither employs any female dentist. As the community in this area is traditional, it is likely that many women would prefer to be treated by a female dentist. She also has been commended for her gentle touch, which is important especially with small children; so she has acquired much experience working with young patients. Therefore, she intends to specialise in the treatment of young children. Finally, she recognises a need in the community to provide dental services at home for elderly housebound patients. She has received business training from MATI (a local training organisation). So, she now plans to acquire the equipment to set up her dental practice. She has negotiated a deal with an organisation that specialises in providing such equipment \u2013 the overall cost would be NIS 64,000 but she needs a downpayment of NIS 27,000.

She learned how to do this very early on from her mom (like most women of her ethnic group:  the Minianka).  She has been doing this work in her home for fifteen years.  To obtain the supplementary financial resources, she decided to turn to the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which she is on her first individual loan.\r\n<p>She gets her basic supplies in the villages surrounding Koutiala on market days.  With this loan, she intends to buy 30 sacks of n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds of different grades that she will have taken to Koutiala.  These seeds are pounded, boiled, and crushed and then transformed into rounded forms or into a powder.  Next, these Sounbala are put into a container for sale in bulk in Koutiala with enterprises at the marketplace or in the home.  A portion of the production is dispatched to Sikasso and to Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali) and is sold on credit, payable monthly, and sometimes by cash, to customers essentially made up of women and retailers.  \r\n<p>With this new loan, she intends to realize a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that she intends to use to cover the loan interest and to help with family expenses, the bulk of which falls upon her shoulders.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, a Kiva volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\nMadame Agn\u00e8s Berth\u00e9 est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 36 ans et  vit avec ses 3 enfants (1 gar\u00e7on et 2 filles) son mari et des parents dans une grande famille traditionnelle \u00e9largie au quartier K\u00f4k\u00f4 de la pr\u00e9fecture de Koutiala (troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion \u00e9conomique du Mali)\r\n<p>Depuis sa tendre enfance elle commence les activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de revenus de toutes sortes, mais d\u00e9cide finalement de se sp\u00e9cialiser dans la transformation des graines de n\u00e9r\u00e9 en Sounbala (un condiment alimentaire naturel aux vertus multiples) qu\u2019elle apprena tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t aupr\u00e8s de sa maman (comme la plupart des femmes de son ethnie : les Minianka).

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase dryers and to renovate her building","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T21:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zainabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613717},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010796},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233082},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664873},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105585}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T05:18:16Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Sharfman","image":562243}},{"id":105672,"name":"Eugenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eugenia es socia del Banco Comunal Reto\u00f1o.\nEugenia es conviviente, tiene 39 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, Eugenia vende hoja de coca de manera ambulatoria en el mercado Nery Garc\u00eda, sus productos los adquiere en la selva ayacuchana a donde viaja semanalmente.\nEugenia necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1500 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de hoja de coca.\nEugenia sue\u00f1a con comprar una casa y mejorar su negocio.\n","en":"Eugenia is a member of the Banco Comunal Reto\u00f1o.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

business. They started with one piglet that they raised and sold. This is their source of income to support the basic needs of their four children and their education. However, the hog business alone cannot finance the family's financial needs, therefore Salvacion also sells fish. Even with all of her hard work and perseverance, the business wasn't stable because of insufficient business capital. In 2003, Salvacion joined Ahon Sa HIrap, Inc. (ASHI). She took out a loan from the institution to finance her business. As a result of the loans she received, her business has grown and she has been able to send all of her children to school. Three are high school graduates and her 8 year old youngest child is in elementary school. \r\n\r\nOut of the profits her business had generated, Salvacion was able to buy a motorcycle. Her desire for taking out a larger loan from ASHI is to increase her hog business and her profits to be able to buy a sidecar to attach to her motorcycle for a tricycle for hire business in the future.\r\n\r\nTricycle is one of the most common means of transportation all over the province. With this business, Salvacion could provide a daily income for her family's needs. She also hoped that out of her business profits her two children who are still in school will graduate from college."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":372713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She is 67 years old. Benita is married and has 8 adult-aged children. To make a living, Benita owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Benita has been engaged in her business for over 50 years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2001, Benita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Benita successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from PMPC, which was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Benita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be the 11th loan taken out by Benita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
