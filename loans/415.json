It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Edilberto lives with his wife and two daughters. Like many member of the Los Chiles community, Edilberto is a farmer. He dedicates his time to the planting and harvesting of various subsistence crops including chili peppers. Edilberto is always busy. He organizes his day so that in the morning he wakes up early, eats breakfast and then tends to his chickens. At night, when he has finished working in the fields, he puts in a few more hours at the corner store, which is a part of his house. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Habanero chili peppers.  Specifically, Edilberto will use this money to purchase seeds, fertilizer, tools, pesticides, and other materials\/ingredients necessary to the production of chili peppers. All labor and transportation tasks will be carried out by Edilberto and his family. Edilberto dedicates part of his time as a hired hand on a nearby farm. He worries about the coming harvesting season and hopes that he will be successful this year.  Edilberto\u00b4s goal is to maintain stability in his family, achieve higher production rates, improve his economic situation and offer a better standard of living to his family. A major difficulty and limitation for Edilberto has been his lack of working capital. He hopes to use this loan effectively to improve life on the farm for everyone.\r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or, PROPICA is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products.

PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Los Chiles, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA, represents a unique opportunity to Edilberto, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Edilberto wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. He wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his neighborhood. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":573606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase seeds and nutrients for the production of chili peppers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Los Chiles","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-07-23T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edilberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95914.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97513.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99138.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100790.99},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102470.84},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104171.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.97},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.39},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":174.19,"local_amount":88946.9,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":89708.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222221629},{"amount":1000.81,"local_amount":511053.1,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":515426.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315614319}],"funded_date":"2010-07-25T04:00:52Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":221628,"name":"Mario Ivan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mario de 45 a\u00f1os, vive en la Perimetral de Guayaquil (zona periurbana, rodeada de un estero salado) el tiene una peque\u00f1a tienda en la parte delantera de su casa. \n\nMario comenz\u00f3 vendiendo arroz, bebidas y otros v\u00edveres para poder mantener a sus dos hijos y esposa que le ayuda en el negocio.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns a living selling pigs.  She has a small stable where she raises them and when they've been fattened, she sells them at a local livestock market.  Jazmina gets up every morning, very early, to feed her animals.  She feeds them 3 times a day in order to get the best price for them because well-fed pigs fetch more money.  For the future, Jazmina is thinking of selling more pigs, a plan that will require her to expand the stable where she raises them.  This is her first MFP loan and she's very glad to be able to help herself and to be considered for membership in her community bank.  The money that she's applying for will be used to buy siding, bags of cement, bricks and framing to improve her stable.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":304277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Improve pig pen for livestock business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T22:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jazmina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1012.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842102}],"funded_date":"2009-04-18T00:40:46Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":106076,"name":"Juana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juana es socia del Banco Comunal Desarrollo.\nJuana es casada, tiene 29 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, Juana junto a su esposo fabrican ladrillos de manera artesanal, para lo cual cuentan con un horno a le\u00f1a, sus ventas los realiza en el mismo lugar.\nJuana necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1200 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de tierra.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Juana son mejorar su negocio y construir el segundo piso de su casa.\n","en":"Juana is a member of the Desarrollo (\"Development\") Community Bank.

Hog fattening is raising piglets for three to four months. After those months, the pigs have grown and they will be sold. Profit from this kind of business is double the amount of its capital. Piglets bought for Php 1,500 to Php 2,000 can be sold to Php 4,000 to Php 6,000 after four months. Norma started by raising two piglets. After that, the loans she accessed from ASHI were used for growing her later business. Profits she made from the hog fattening were re-invested in her variety store business. <P>\r\n\r\nSomeday, Norma hopes to have bigger pig pen to raise many pigs for a bigger profit. Her ambition of growing her business and having more profits is because of her desire to have savings for her unemployed husband and herself in case of emergency, for she doesn't like her children to be financially bothered about them. She and her husband have been living alone together for many years since their children have had their own families.

She is 32 years old. Cecelia is the group leader of a ten-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCecelia is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising pigs for fattening and sale. She is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Cecelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.\r\n\r\nCecelia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which again will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 7th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She lives with her spouse and their two-year-old son.  They live together in her parents\u2019 house with her parents and her grandparents.  \r\n\r\nIda\u2019s work consists in selling fish.  She goes out early in the morning to look for fresh fish in the city\u2019s Bellavista market.  From there she takes the products to her spouse\u2019s father\u2019s house, a place with lots of passersby.  She sets up a table there to sell this seafood and waits for customers to come by looking for fresh fish.  She\u2019s been doing this work for a year and to date has been doing it alone because her spouse works in another department of Per\u00fa; he sends her a bit of economic help.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that it leaves her with time to be at home doing other things during the afternoon and also because every day she earns good income because her work produces good profits.  She hopes to be able to support herself and perhaps later on open a grocery store at home.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second MFP loan.  She did well with the previous one and was responsible with her payments.  She is very grateful for the opportunity she\u2019s being given to increase working capital because that will lead to higher profits.  She will use the requested 1000 soles to buy fresh fish as well as a few trays and materials to be able to sell her fish more comfortably.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":907568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more fish and trays.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-30T20:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":144.12},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":158.56},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":172.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":185.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.76},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.47},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.05,"local_amount":144.12,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":146.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621886},{"amount":59.75,"local_amount":159.34,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":161.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835961},{"amount":59.46,"local_amount":158.56,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":160.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245719},{"amount":64.76,"local_amount":172.69,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":175.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385755},{"amount":67.47,"local_amount":179.92,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":182.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098849},{"amount":69.51,"local_amount":185.37,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":187.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712976}],"funded_date":"2011-10-30T21:52:08Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":356912,"name":"Madina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Madina lives in Kampala, Uganda.

He is a married man and lives with his wife and 3 children, aged between 9 and 16 years, in the municipality of Soledad where he has a restaurant. He sells meals, set meals and fast food among the other delights of Caribbean cuisine. He started out as an entrpreneur selling fish which he brought from Sucre, a municipality he used to live in before, to sell at the public market in the city of Barranquilla where he sold it at his brother-in-law's stall. Gradually he built up a large clientele and for this reason decided to move to Soledad, where he bought a plot of land and built his own house, looking for a way to not have to travel so much and pay more attention to his family. There, together with his wife, he started making meals and this is what he currently does and with which he has managed to take care of his family. Currently he is applying for his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo with which he will buy ingredients to make his food in larger quantities. He will also repair his industrial oven, looking to get it in excellent condition for the end of year, a season of  great commercial activity in the food sector as families celebrate and buy ready made food instead of making it themselves. His main customers are his neighbours and a few people who work in companies and usually come to savour the delicious sancochos (traditional, regional type of stew), prepared at the small rneighbourhood restaurant of Ciudadela Metropolitana and which are now well known. His investment will be successful because he will receive discounts for bulk purchase buying and cash payments and because it will increase his working capital and earn him a bit more than usual.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":939930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to make his food in larger quantities and also repair his industrial oven.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-11T14:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristo  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":73173},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":74880},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":76627},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":78415},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80245},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82117},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84033},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85994},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88001},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90054},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":92155},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94306}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.12},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.42,"local_amount":73173,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":74027.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188780},{"amount":39.31,"local_amount":74880,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":75754.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324985},{"amount":40.23,"local_amount":76627,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":77521.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039046},{"amount":126.41,"local_amount":240777,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":243588.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338319},{"amount":89.26,"local_amount":170027,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":172012.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301394902},{"amount":46.2,"local_amount":88001,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":89028.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774738},{"amount":47.28,"local_amount":90054,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":91105.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386728},{"amount":97.89,"local_amount":186461,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":188637.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993624}],"funded_date":"2012-01-13T17:11:06Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":373300,"name":"Adnan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adnan is a 30-year-old young man, and he is a father to two sons and two daughters.

She is currently helping her son in polishing the furniture. Her husband is a construction worker and her other child is a blue-collar worker. The family\u2019s income, as a result, has become much more stable. Mrs. Hoa is very interested in borrowing loan and paying it back in a certain period of time because it has helped her better manage the family\u2019s finances. She and other members in her group have fully paid back the loans in the first round. In the next round of loan, other members in her group include:\r\nMr. Nguyen Van Tai, aged 46, would like to borrow 5.152.000 VND to make and sell rice.\r\nMrs. Nguyen Thi M., aged 50, would like to borrow 4.704.000 VND to raise poultry.\r\nMrs. Man Thi Luyen, aged 29, would like to borrow 4.704.000 VND to make and serve breakfasts for customers. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese

Cuando aument\u00f3 el volumen de clientes, hizo cr\u00e9ditos a prestamistas de la calle, para diversificar el negocio ofreciendo  refrescos, fritos y mekatos, esta financiaci\u00f3n le resultaba onerosa y  muchas personas en su barrio, le hablaron de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, fue entonces que inici\u00f3 su relaci\u00f3n con esta entidad, y con su primer cr\u00e9dito reemplaz\u00f3 los pasivos costosos. Actualmente se encuentra tramitando un segundo cr\u00e9dito, el cual va a usar para surtir con refrescos dulces y productos derivados de la harina de trigo sus estantes y va a mejorar la infraestructura su negocio con una cubierta, porque en invierno se moja y no tiene tiempo de recoger sus  muebles y enseres.  Sus principales clientes son los operarios de los talleres industriales que funcionan en este sector comercial que es altamente concurrido.\n\nFernando todos los d\u00edas agradece a Dios  por el amor de la familia y el apoyo de  instituciones y de todas las personas que han cre\u00eddo en \u00e9l.

He is originally from Polonuevo-Regencia, a community in the department of Bolivar. He finished high school with support from his parents. He is grateful to his parents and 5 siblings for the material and emotional support they provided him after he suffered polio when he was 4 years old. He was left with difficulties that prevent him from moving very quickly. He now has his own family with his wife and three children.\n\nFernando is an enthusiastic and optimistic man. He started a business selling sweets and cigarettes with money lent to him by his sister and it has grown, little by little. When he increased his number of customers, he took loans from street lenders to diversify his business of selling soft drinks, fried foods, and sweet breads. This type of financing turned out to be onerous and many people from his neighborhood told him about Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and that was when he began his association with this institution. With his first loan he repaid his previous, expensive loans. He is now requesting a second loan to purchase soft drinks, sweets, bread products, shelving, and he will improve the infrastructure of his business by putting a covering over it, because during the rainy season things get wet and he doesn\u2019t have time to put away his furniture and other belongings. Most of his customers are workers in the industrial workshops that fill this busy commercial area of town.\n\nFernando thanks God every day for the love of his family and the support of the institutions and all of the people who have believed in him. For the future, he hopes to continue being the pillar of strength for his household and, along with his wife, to provide a good example for his 3 children and to give them an education. \n<br

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from these services. Miguel has been engaged in his business for over two years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Miguel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Miguel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from GDMPC. Miguel is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to repair existing vehicle for better service. This will be the tenth loan taken out by Miguel from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She is separated temporarily from her husband because his labor obligations take him out of their city in order to find work to meet their financial needs and responsibilities.  During one of their difficult times, with the help of her eldest daughter, she decided to embark on making juices in her home and to sell them in the city market.  At first it was difficult because she didn't expect how hard it would be to store the prepared juice, since she didn't have the proper space.  Later, and with much effort, Meredith managed to rent a space in the nearby market and in just a short time, things began to improve considerably. Now, due to the increasing demand for her juices, Meredith has decided to acquire more utensils and associated juicing merchandise in order to improve service.

She lives in a rented house with her dear daughter Joselin, age 10, who is the reason for all Emperatriz's work efforts.  Emperatriz's life hasn't been easy, since she was very young she has had to worry about helping with household expenses.  Currently she has a business selling clothes, located in the Tupac Amaru market (a very well-known market in Juliaca city), which offers different types of clothing such as jackets, sweaters, pants, etc.\r\n\r\nShe has done this work for seven years and what she likes best is chatting with neighboring vendors and finding out what is happening in the market.  Emperatriz longs to improve her stand and fill it with more clothing.  What she likes least about the work is having to stay inside her store all day without leaving, although she is willing to make any sacrifice as long as she reaches her goals.  \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP and Emperatriz is determined to make her payments on time, as she did for her previous loans.

Her family are residents of Tabao Baybay, Prk. Malipayon, San Enrique, Negros Occidental. She dreams of providing a proper education for her children, supporting the family's needs and providing them with a better future. This is Mrs. P.'s main concern, because  she knows that if she relies only on her husband's income, all of her dreams would come to naught, because his income is just too small to sustain the needs of her fairly large family. \r\n\r\nBecause of her strong determination to fulfill her dreams, she thought of ways to earn more income. To have access to the much-needed capital to start her business, Perpetua joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, and started selling gasoline in her community. Their place is relatively far from the nearest gasoline station, and there is a demand for gasoline because of the many motorcycles and tricycles (motorcycle with a side-car for passengers) that ply the roads of their community. For 10 years, Perpetua has been fairly successful in this business and it earns her about PHP 4,000 per month.\r\n\r\nThis will be Mrs. P.'s 14th loan from NWTF. She wants to borrow Php 20,000 to use as additional working capital so that she can expand her gasoline retailing business.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

Florence is married to Julien Dossou, an auto mechanic by training who has switched to selling second-hand vehicles. Florence is the mother of three children, all in school, of whom the eldest is in seventh grade. The family lives in Xwlacodji, a shantytown in Cotonou, the economic capital of the Republic of Benin. For 6 years, Florence has had a business selling charcoal; she runs this activity in her area in Xwlacodji. With the aim of enlarging her stock of charcoal and better satisfying her clientele, Florence took out her first loan through ALIDE (one of Kiva's field partners) in 2007. This loan experience was fruitful for Florence, and she recently began selling locally-produced alcoholic beverages. \r\nFlorence has already obtained four loans through ALIDE, all of which she repaid without problems, and with which she was able to raise the level of her business. To continue developing her business activities, Florence is seeking a fifth loan to strengthen her working capital.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

She is 46, single, and has two children.  One child is still dependent upon her.\r\n\r\nRosario is a fighter and a hard-working woman.  She decided to set up her own business selling carbonated drinks.  It is in a very well equipped area in her own house.  She runs the business without having a schedule or a boss.  She tells us that she started with 200 PEN; she bought five packages of soft drinks.  She saw that it went very well for her, so, little by little, she invested more.  She currently continues with the same business.  She is well known by her customers, who are her neighbors, relatives, and friends.\r\n\r\nWith this loan for 1,500 PEN she will buy more drinks like packs of soft drinks in different flavors, sizes, and brands.

He can then better meet the needs of his family and improve his working conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rejelyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Rejelyn from HSPFI.

just for herself but for her family as well. Emma lives in Baseco Port Area, Manila, along with her eight children. Three of her children are already working, four are living at home and one is in elementary grade.\r\n<br>Emma presently owns and manages a small store of accessories, electronic items, gift items, kitchen utensils and other items commonly used in household chores in Filipino homes. Her store is situated along Corazon Aquino Public Market in Baseco, Manila. She buys her items in bulk quantities and sells them piecemeal with minimum mark-up. Emma earns at least 10,000 PHP monthly from her business, which she uses to meet her family's needs and add to her present business capital.\r\n<br>Emma's current challenge is that the local government keeps transferring vendors' stores, including hers, from one place to another. She hopes this month the local government will settle them in a permanent location at the market. She also hopes that her business will continue to grow and that she will be able to send all her children all the way through college. To help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 14,000 PHP. She plans to use this loan to purchase additional items for her store. Emma believes that through this loan, she will be able to expand her inventory and increase her earning capacity.\r\n<br>As a CCT community partner*, Emma faithfully attends her weekly fellowship meetings where she can draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God as a mother and as a micro-entrepreneur.\r\n<p>\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.

She and her husband have been together for 25 years.  They have seven children, but only six live with them in the house they own in the village of San Antonio.  Every morning Solema proceeds to her farmland located outside of town.  Her daily routine involves carrying her work tools with her because she spends a great deal of time removing weeds that can negatively impact the growth of her crops.  Her main products are potatoes, peas, corn, beans, and carrots.  These products are sold at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma, the place where she travels to after each harvest.  In addition, Solema engages in raising bulls.  After purchasing her animals, she fattens them before taking them to the city of Huancayo to be sold at a better price.  \u201cI raise three or four young bulls at a time and earn at least 200 PEN for each one,\u201d says Solema.

She and her husband, Emiliano, have been together for 5 years and have a daughter, Helen.  The family lives in a house they own in the rural town of Quebrada.  With working capital of only 2,000 soles, Modesta is building a better future for her family.  She goes to town on Fridays to buy merchandise for her general store, the only one for miles around.  She goes on Fridays because there's a market in the town that day.  She buys her animals at the market--sheep and pigs, for example--animals that she raises with a lot of care and dedication because they are an important source of income for her.  She says that her husband is a farmer and his most important crop is maca.  Every morning, very early, he goes out to his fields to tend the crop, taking great care because maca is very valuable.  They are now planning another maca crop and they are sure it will be a big success.  Modesta belongs to the Los Puquiales community bank and this is her fifth MFP loan.  She is grateful for the help she has received from the bank in the past and expects that the new loan will help her meet her goals.  She is committed to repaying the loan in the agreed-upon time.  She will use the loan to buy 5 kilos of maca seeds for her next crop.

Mrs. Adela is the group\u2019s representative.  Mrs. Adela and her fellow members all live in the same neighborhood.  There are four men and eleven women in the group who make a living doing various things like:  selling beer, plants, bread, clothing and some who build houses, work in transportation, and others who work as employees at various businesses.  There is a lot of competition, which is why they need to be able to count on some capital, so they can buy merchandise, supplies, and tools for work that will help them generate better incomes and help maintain their families.  Most members are new at being in a solidarity group, but they know how to be responsible, since the wellbeing of their homes depends on this.  This is why the Agrocapital Foundationoffers them financial support.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva

Luzviminda has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Luzviminda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the product range. This will be the fourth loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

servicio de transporte de carga y pasajeros desde hace mas de diez a\u00f1os. El encargado de manejar el veh\u00edculo es su esposo y diariamente recorre rutas en el pueblo de Za\u00f1a, el cercano distrito de Cayalt\u00ed y los anexos de la zona. Esta actividad es la unica fuente de ingresos con la que cuentan, por lo que siempre tratan de trabajar el mayor tiempo posible.\n\nPrecisamente, debido al continuo uso y al estado accidentado de los caminos de la zona, el veh\u00edculo ha empezado a sufrir algunas fallas mec\u00e1nicas que requieren de urgente reparaci\u00f3n para garantizar su correcto funcionamiento, es por ello que Amelia ha solicitado a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 2000 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en la reparaci\u00f3n y mantenimiento de la unidad m\u00f3vil, as\u00ed como en la compra de diversos accesorios para equiparla.\n\nAmelia es conocida en su vecindario por ser una persona tranquila y de confianza.

This district is known for its Afro-Peruvian dances and traditions, and is located 45 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband have a mototaxi (a motorcycle with a transportation cabin attached) and have been offering a freight and passenger transport service for more than ten years. Her husband drives the vehicle and everyday he travels around the town of  Za\u00f1a, the nearby district of Cayalt\u00ed and other neighbouring areas. This work is their only source of income, so they always try to work the longest possible hours.\r\n\r\nTherefore, due to the poor condition of the area's roads and the continuous use of the vehicle, it has begun to suffer a few mechanical faults which require urgent repair in order for it to run properly. This is why Amelia has requested a loan of $725 (2000 'nuevos soles') from Edpyme Alternativa, which she hopes to spend on the repair and maintenance of the mobile unit, as well as the purchase of various accessories for it.\r\n\r\nAmelia is known by her neighbours to be a quiet and trustworthy person. She has worked with our institution in the past and has shown that she is punctual and responsible when it comes to making payments.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate

She has worked in this business for a long time. At the beginning she had only a simple sewing machine, a lot of energy, and the support of her family. Gradually she managed to acquire her flat-bed sewing machine and her serger, and thus she has continued growing her business until she had a workshop infrastructure that produced profits, with which she can acquire everything necessary to support her three children, of ages 4 months, 7, and 9. For this reason, her dream is to grow and strengthen her workshop in order to have a future with better well-being and more opportunities for her family.\r\n\r\nWith her Kiva loan, which is her first, she will buy a collar machine and a serger. With them she will be able to improve the quality and time in production, in addition to decreasing the cost of production, since she hires these services and has to pay transportation to obtain them. Now her greatest challenge is keeping up with production, which grows every day, since she does not have the machines that her work requires or the time that she needs to dedicate to her little children. But she knows that she is building the family future, and this is precisely why she works hard.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva

She lives in Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing and fish vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,600. Evelyn is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase fishing net and more fish to sell. This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Evelyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.

This is also  with the help of her husband, who for many years was employed at various stores, but always with the intention of one day having his own. He achieved it after uniting with Georgina, when his desire for independence increased. Four years ago they used their savings to acquire a small store in the municipality of Galapa, which went well for them. However, since their plans were to achieve a bigger sales point, they moved to the parish of Juan Mina, where they acquired the store that they have today.  They bought the house on credit, agreeing to a term of 5 years to make the complete payment. To date, they only owe the last two years.  The financial state of the store shows the profit margin that allows them to easily cover their costs and expenses, which allows them to permanently reinvest in their business.

Her aim is to show the world that, in spite of all the difficulties that she faced, she was able to get ahead in life.  For this reason, Nelly works hard selling beauty products.  She gets up very early in the morning to prepare food for her family and then heads off to carry out her work.  Her husband works as a construction worker while she grabs her catalog of beauty products and goes through the streets of her district, offering her goods for sale to friends and acquaintances who are her potential customers.  Nelly is happy with the work that she does because, thanks to her work, she makes profits and some bonuses.  In the near future, she would like to open a beauty salon.\r\n\r\nThis will be Nelly's first loan from MFP and she pledges to make her repayments on time.

This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. <P>The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":191852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional supplies in bulk for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T01:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yasinta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T05:14:20Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":100571.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":102344,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356196},{"amount":87,"local_amount":99428.57,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":101181,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347938},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":101762.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970512},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":101762.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886729},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:22Z","rounded_local_amount":101762.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435989},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:51Z","rounded_local_amount":101762.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130287},{"amount":87.49,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":101762.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027118},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":101762.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613158},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":101762.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010241},{"amount":87.51,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":101762.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232552}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T05:14:20Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65167,"name":"Bashir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bashir R. is 25 years old, single, and lives in the Southern Suburbs of Beirut.

She has been selling food since she was very young, but the cost of rent at her restaurant drove her to bankruptcy. She had to find other ways to earn a living, so she began doing cleaning at a high school where she began to get clients for whom she prepared foods. For the past 2 years she has been bringing food to the teachers at the school and some of the students.

Three years ago, H\u00e9ctor and his wife owned a grocery store that they were forced to close because they were not able to stay in business.  Happily they have invested a lot of effort into reopening the business and are looking forward to making it happen.

The couple cover the household expenses between them. Epiphanie went to school very little. For almost eight years she has been carrying out a business selling various products (liqueurs, appetizers, mineral water, soaps and washing powder, etc.) in her shop in Catchi in Porto-Novo. At the same time Epiphanie has a secondary activity which is the sale of fabric; this allows her to have several sources of income. She stocks up at Cotonou, the economic capital of B\u00e9nin. Epiphanie has had one loan from ALID\u00e9, which she repaid without incident. Her ambition is to increase her working capital and raise her activity level in order to satisfy her customers better. But currently Epiphanie has difficulties getting supplies.

She lives in her own home with her husband Richard, age 34, and their two darling children for whom she hopes to provide a better future.  Mariluz works every day in her fields.  Her crops are among the best cultivated in the village of Paucarmarca.  Every day she leaves early in order to work her land because she knows the importance of keeping it maintained.  In addition, Mariluz raises animals because it is very profitable and she is one of the few people in the area who does this type of work.  What she enjoys most about her job is the freedom to make her own decisions.  She has been in this business for 15 years and says the most difficult part is transporting her animals to the livestock fair in the city of Tarma.  For now, she hopes to buy more cattle to increase her existing herd.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  Mariluz feels obligated to complete her payments on time because she does not want to create problems for her Communal Bank.  She is greatly admired by the other members and is always receiving advice from them.  With the loan of 1000 PEN that she requested, she will buy a bull.  The actual cost of the bull is close to 2000 PEN, but she is willing to use her personal savings to cover the remaining cost.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":541309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a bull","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-19T11:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariluz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1063.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886433}],"funded_date":"2010-05-19T13:44:05Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":205322,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anita L. is from the village of Marabulig 1, Cauayan City.
