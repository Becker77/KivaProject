She hopes to continue helping her children so that they keep making progress and know how to look after themselves, and so that in the future all of their needs are met.\r\n\r\nSaadia has run her own business selling sheets for 10 years.  She started the business on her own count, with half a dozen sheets that she put on display in the small grocery store run by her mother so that when customers came into the store they would see her merchandise.

Karomat is a 63-year-old woman who has been working the land for twenty years. She is a strong physical and spiritual woman and, each day, she and her husband work diligently to make sure that they take good care of their crop.\r\n\r\nTheir biggest source of income is the fruit of their labor; they grow onions, wheat and watermelons. Karomat is proud of the quality of her crops and of her knowledge. While waiting for the best moment of production, she is requesting a loan in order to maintain her crops, holding off on the harvest until the market indicates that it is the best time to yield the biggest profits.\r\n\r\nKaromat\u2019s dream is to acquire more land and produce more crops in the future because the land that she loves and has been a part of her life has allowed her to move her family forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 58 years old, is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Maura owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling food products in the local community. Maura has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 12000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maura joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Maura is requesting a new loan of 35000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married and has 2 children aged 30 and 25. In 1980, she established her agriculture business, and works 7 days a week and 8 hours a day to support her family. She has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan from Patan BPW, which she used to increase the investment in her agriculture business. In the future, Krishna Kumari plans to increase her income from agriculture. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

de 31 a\u00f1os, vive en su casa que es propia en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo Ronald de 30 a\u00f1os, que es obrero en una f\u00e1brica y de sus 2 peque\u00f1os hijos, juntos habitan en un populoso barrio al  norte de la ciudad. Desde muy joven se ha dedicado ha laborar en distintos oficios, y luego que se junto con su pareja, se le ocurri\u00f3 emprender un nuevo negocio para ayudarle con los gastos del hogar. En la actualidad, y en sociedad con una amiga se dedica a la crianza y comercializaci\u00f3n de pollos, dice que la labor debe ser constante, pues desde muy peque\u00f1os los polluelos requieren de esmerados cuidados para lograr crecer sin dificultad. Al principio fue f\u00e1cil, pero a medida que aumentaba estos animales tuvieron que trasladarlos a un espacio m\u00e1s amplio. Le gusta mucho el negocio de comercializaci\u00f3n de pollos, pues \u00e9stos crecen r\u00e1pido y en solo un mes ya los pueden vender. Pero lo que no le gusta es subir el cerro donde esta ubicada el galp\u00f3n, pues es algo dificultoso, ya que ella adolece de los ri\u00f1ones. Y como es una mujer emprendedora tiene grandes sue\u00f1os para ampliar este negocio, y uno de ellos es comprar un terreno para aumentar la cantidad de pollos, y as\u00ed mejorar sus ganancias. Es el primer cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP, y promete pagar con puntualidad sus cuotas, ya que desea seguir trabajando en busca del progreso, adem\u00e1s esta muy agradecida con todas las personas que hicieron posible el dinero que le permitir\u00e1 ampliar su negocio. Ana tiene planeado invertir este cr\u00e9dito solicitado en la compra de alimento balanceado y vitaminas para brindarles a sus polluelos el mejor cuidado, de esta manera espera venderlos a mayor precio y obtener mejores ganancias. \n\n","en":"Ana is 31 years old and lives in her own house.  She lives in the company of her 30-year old husband, Ronald, who is a factory worker, and her 2 small children.  Together, they live in a populated neighborhood north of the city.  \r\n<p>\r\nSince she was young, she has worked in different jobs but after marrying her husband, she decided to start a new business to help with the household expenses.  Now, in association with a friend, she works raising and selling chickens.  She says that the work must be constant because from the time that they are very small, the chicks require a great deal of care so that they grow without any difficulty.  At the beginning it was easy, but as the number of animals increased, they had to take them to a larger space.  She likes selling chickens very much \u2013 they grow quickly and they can be sold in just a month.  However, what she doesn\u2019t like is going up the hill to where the barn is located, as it is difficult since she has backaches.\r\n<p>\r\nSince she is an enterprising woman, she has big dreams to expand this business and one of those dreams is to purchase a piece of land to increase the number of chickens and, in that way, increase her earnings. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she promises to make her payments punctually, since she wants to continue working in search of progress.  In addition, she is very grateful for all of the people that made this loan possible, which will allow her to expand her business.  Ana plans to invest the loan requested in the purchase of balanced diet and vitamins to provide better care to her chicks.  This way, she hopes to sell them at a better price and earn more money.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kathleen O&#039;Connell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":596792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase feed for her chicks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-08T05:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":118.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":139.51},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":148.85},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":152.19},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":157.68},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167.94},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170.79},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":175.65},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":182.01},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":189.98},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":194.99},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.93},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.96},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.16},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.98},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.87},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.68},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":42.93,"local_amount":118.43,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":120.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449930},{"amount":50.57,"local_amount":139.51,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":141.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588629},{"amount":53.96,"local_amount":148.85,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:01Z","rounded_local_amount":150.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725134},{"amount":55.17,"local_amount":152.19,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":154.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463229},{"amount":57.16,"local_amount":157.68,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":159.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886632},{"amount":60.88,"local_amount":167.94,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":170.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326955},{"amount":61.91,"local_amount":170.79,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":173.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195546},{"amount":63.67,"local_amount":175.65,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:09Z","rounded_local_amount":178.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549389},{"amount":278.75,"local_amount":768.96,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":779.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718161}],"funded_date":"2010-09-08T15:44:32Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen O'Connell","image":578556}},{"id":233628,"name":"Rosa Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa vive en una zona urbana en el suburbio.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This will be her third cycle with the communal bank and she likes the quick loans with low interest rates. \r\nHer dream is to open her own boutique.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":932708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-11-29T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilis Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":990,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":123.75,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250774722},{"amount":250,"local_amount":247.5,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257183091},{"amount":250,"local_amount":247.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263318510},{"amount":375,"local_amount":371.25,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033592}],"funded_date":"2011-12-03T17:05:12Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:25:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

For the past two years, she has been working hard to manage her small shop, which sells second-hand clothing. <p>\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Moreen has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more bundles of clothing for resale, and will help Moreen to generate greater profits and improve her family's standard of living. Moreen hopes that in the future she will be able to buy land to build a house on. <p>\r\n\r\nMoreen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Moreen's future prospects by helping her to develop life goals.

The trip is long and dangerous.\r\n\r\nEven though it\u2019s a sacrifice, it\u2019s very profitable because, thanks to her skills, she is able to give a good life to her children.  This is the reason that she is planning to increase her coffee production, so that she can increase her income.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan through MFP and she guarantees that she will make each payment on time and prove that everything is possible with perseverance.

V. is a 58 year-old man who lives with his wife and son in the Costa Rican community General Viejo de P\u00e9rez Zeled\u00f3n.  Their community is known for its location in the General's Valley.  The area's principal economic activities are livestock, agriculture, and commerce, with the latter having grown significantly and offering new opportunities for work.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has worked in agriculture his whole life, but he has ten years of experience raising and fattening pigs, which has been one of his principal economic activities.  He and two partners are in the process of building the largest pig pen in their community.\r\n\r\nFor now, Jos\u00e9 would like a microloan of \u00a2615,000 to buy more pigs and improve the care conditions and infrastructure of his pig pen.  With this loan, he hopes to reach his goal of having 150 pigs to fatten and take advantage of the current market's high prices for pork, which will allow him to increase sales and improve his living conditions.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is a member of the Association of General Valley Producers, one of the hundred partner organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.

Habitat, Brgy. Cantil-e, Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  General Store and Food Vending businesses. Her husband Eugenio P., who is 35 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are 8 to 16 years old. \r\n\r\nMarivic joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marivic has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.

She is married and supports her family by operating a fish vending business. She lives in Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. \r\n\r\nMarites has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6000. \r\n\r\nMarites is borrowing PHP 18000 so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step on her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nMarites aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is married to Ruth, a 38 year old lady. From his marriage, Fazri has been blessed with 2 children, namely Gloryanti, 16 years old who is in the 1st grade of senior high school, and Imanuel who is in the 2nd grade of junior high school. Fasri and his family live in Oesao Village.\r\n\r\nFazri generates money by working as a motorcycle mechanic. He started this business using initial capital of IDR 500,000. He bought simple mechanical equipment while he uses his house as a repair shop. By using inadequate tools, Fazri needs more time to repair a motorcycle. Usually, Fazri needs about one week to repair 1 or 2 motorcycles. The income is usually spent on rice, side dishes and other daily needs. \r\n\r\nFazri wants to set up a repair shop which is more strategic. However, he also needs more mechanical equipment to support him in doing a better job. According to Fazri, adequate equipment is very essential to the progress of his business. Fazri is requesting a loan of IDR 5,000,000 from TLM to purchase the mechanical equipment. He really hopes that he can improve his business well."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":715165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

historical background, but also for its citizens, who are hardworking, self-confident people. One of the examples is Gulzat A.. She is a well-educated young lady. After graduating from the university, she worked in the bank as a financier for many years. Everything was fine, but since the ambitious mind wants success, as it always does, she was not satisfied with her salary and left the job. \r\n\r\nThen she attended a sewing course. Later on she borrowed 20,000 KGS ($445) and opened up a rented pavilion. Now she sews curtains and makes national crafts. At present, she is thirty-six years old and married. She has a daughter, age sixteen, who attends the local school. Her husband works in a plastics factory in the capital. \r\n\r\nNow her profits per month are about 9,000 KGS ($200). She wants a loan to buy fabrics to expand her assortment, because in March she is going to another city to trade. With the money that she would earn, she wants to buy domestic appliances.\r\n\r\nBubukan C. is a married woman whose husband is a pensioner, but has enough strength to help his wife in her business. In 1997 they began to fatten and sell sheep. With the money earned they married off their son and expanded their number of sheep. They began this business with 2,000 KGS ($45) and now their monthly profit is about 15,000 KGS ($335). With the loan they want to buy nine sheep for 2,000 to 2,500 KGS ($45 to $55) each. \r\n\r\nBakytbek C. is a married man, forty years old. His wife works as a credit manager. He has two children and the elder one attends school. He works in forensics (death investigation) as a dispatcher, and his salary is 6,000 KGS ($134). He is planning to provide education for his children and buy a car as well. With the loan he wants to buy hay.\r\n\r\nRahat A. is a thirty-six year old married woman. She saved some money, approximately 35,000 KGS ($778), with which she bought materials and sewed them using patterns. Her husband does not work now. Her profit per month is about 10,000 KGS ($225). Also she has a daughter who studies at the university and she paid her tuition of about 18,000 KGS ($400). By getting a loan she would expand her assortment of fabrics in order to work in another town.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of a 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Her fondest wish is to offer her two darling daughters, Celeste and Antuanette, a good education.\r\n\r\nFrom early on she saw it was necessary to work to make a living, since by 15 years old she was already a mother with a daughter to support. Her sister-in-law, wanting to help her out, hired her as an assistant in her food stall in the city market, where Lisely now works serving customers and helping with all the kitchen duties.\r\n\r\nLisely really enjoys cooking and takes full advantage of the few opportunities her sister-in-law gives her when she asks her to cook and take care of the business. She's been working in the food stall for six years, and what she finds most challenging is attending to all the customers at once. In the next few months she plans to set up her own food stall, since she feels it's time to have her own business.\r\n\r\nThis is Lisely's fifth loan with MFP and, just as she did with her previous loans, she intends to pay it off in full and on time.

todas las integrantes son oriundas de zonas muy humildes  y  desprotegidas alejadas de la ciudad es por ello que las mismas se sienten muy agradecidas por la oportunidad que les brinda el Programa de

estas se\u00f1oras hay poco movimiento econ\u00f3mico por ellas deben viajar hasta el centro de la ciudad para ofrecer sus productos como por ejemplo, leche, yuca, queso, verduras frescas, ma\u00edz, man\u00ed, chipas, grasas, y otros productos que las mismas elaboran para vender.\nUna de las integrantes es la se\u00f1ora Teresa a A. quien se dedica a la venta de leche.\nElla posee varias vacas

Katupyry Women's Committee was formed in November 2009 and is now developing the third cycle of its Women's Committee program. \r\n\r\nThis group belongs to one of the rural zones of Encarnaci\u00f3n so all the members are from very humble, unprotected areas outside of the city. Because of this they feel very grateful for the opportunity offered by the Committee of Rural Women program which provides them with the chance for people to know about the work they do day after day to help their families get ahead. In the area where these women live, there is little economic activity so they need to travel to the center of the city to offer their products such as milk, yuca, fresh vegetables, cheese, corn, peanuts, tortillas, oil and lard, and other products that they produce for sale.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Ms.Teresa A. who works selling milk. She has several milk cows and to care for them she must work several hours each day taking care of the cows since her husband works the entire day as a farmer. She sometimes does the work with the help of her children who also study.\r\n\r\nEvery day she gets up very early to milk the cows since by early morning she must have everything ready for sale from her house or to take to the city.\r\n\r\nShe requests the loan for the purchase of wood since she wants to construct milking stalls that will greatly facilitate her daily work.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

She is married and has 3 children aged 12, 6, and 4 months.  In 2005, she established  her agirculture business.  Working 7 days a week and 8 hours a day, she supports her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid 3 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to purchase vegetable seeds and materials.  In the future, Bishnu plans to send her children to school.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The members of this communal bank have a variety of businesses, including: food sales, potato chip production, neighborhood store, aluminum sales, jewelry store, metal mechanic, medicine distributor, bookbinder, blanket weaving, and popcorn sales.\r\n\r\nMagali states that this is her first time taking a loan as a member of Pro Mujer, which she joined at the invitation of a loan officer.  She currently has a business making and selling potato chips.  She learned this trade from her mother-in-law, and she has been doing this work for a year.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she will take will be used to increase her working capital (so that she can buy sacks of potatoes and cooking oil.)  She will buy these supplies in the Ceja neighborhood near the railway (the commercial area of the city of El Alto), and she will later sell her products in the schools and stores from Mondays until Fridays.  This type of work allows her to generate resources to support her family as much as she can; she lives with a partner and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answered that she enjoys sharing with her friends.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph the member Lucia is missing because she was in the office."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":800567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy sacks of potatoes and cooking oil ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2011-06-28T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magali Gricelda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tereza\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha  Eugenia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina Mauricia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristian Marcos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joaquina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":13131.3,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1313.24},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1313.24},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1313.24},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1313.24},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1313.24},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1313.24},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1313.24},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1313.24},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1313.24},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.02},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.02},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.02},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.02},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.02},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.01},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":380.03,"local_amount":2626.48,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2645.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221746227},{"amount":570.05,"local_amount":3939.72,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3967.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227115851},{"amount":380.03,"local_amount":2626.48,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2645.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232877506},{"amount":380.03,"local_amount":2626.48,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:20:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2645.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238694213},{"amount":189.86,"local_amount":1312.14,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1321.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244650247}],"funded_date":"2011-07-04T05:11:12Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":315621,"name":"Ulpatkan's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ulpatkan is the leader of this group.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":24385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing five young cows, feed, and veterinary care","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Mboul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.749444 -17.0975","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2007-04-11T01:17:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moussa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-25T18:26:55Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2007-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2007-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":109,"local_amount":109,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T03:56:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41417},{"amount":109,"local_amount":109,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T16:58:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50154},{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:21:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63296},{"amount":109,"local_amount":109,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:34:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80018},{"amount":189,"local_amount":189,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:35:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":189,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93764},{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T05:03:39Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106905},{"amount":172,"local_amount":172,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T20:59:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717},{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158720},{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183474},{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211070},{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239218}],"funded_date":"2007-04-11T18:26:55Z","paid_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11584,"name":"Celine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celine was born in 1948.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

","en":"Bubutay is a 66-year-old pensioner and a window.  She had worked as a seamstress for a long time and is now involved in sewing national goods that are in high demand among the local population.  Bubutay is a mother of seven children and a grandmother of 21 grandchildren.  In search of a financial source, her family started their own animal husbandry and farming business in 1995.

This is 46-year-old Isabella M. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with four children. Isabella has been running a caf\u00e9 business since 1990. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all-local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces. Her business is doing well. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by two employees. Isabella currently earns about 50 USD from her business and is requesting a loan of 275 USD in order to buy additional utensils, cooking oil, rice and maize flour. In the future, she plans to establish another caf\u00e9. Isabella thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

With funds she is requesting, she will buy more wood to keep her business active. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lauren Jackson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":423392,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-10T01:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":111.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":111.65},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":116.27},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":121.97},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":128.31},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":130.31},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":137.95},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":142.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.08},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.69},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.91},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.61},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":111.12,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:16Z","rounded_local_amount":113.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843179},{"amount":77.97,"local_amount":222.77,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":228.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734766},{"amount":1.8,"local_amount":5.15,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124120},{"amount":42.69,"local_amount":121.97,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":124.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959831},{"amount":44.91,"local_amount":128.31,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:28Z","rounded_local_amount":131.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992676},{"amount":45.61,"local_amount":130.31,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":133.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717459},{"amount":48.28,"local_amount":137.95,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":141.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751199},{"amount":49.85,"local_amount":142.42,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933752}],"funded_date":"2009-11-10T06:15:00Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauren Jackson","image":null}},{"id":155172,"name":"Rachel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rachel is a mother of four currently living in Asugkah, just outside of Bamenda.  \r\n\r\nThrough various struggles, Rachel has managed to keep a positive attitude that is reflected in her smile.

Despite her troubles, Rachel is very hopeful for her future and that of her children.   \r\n\r\nRachel has been a GHAPE member for 18 years!  She is currently on her ninth loan and has successfully repaid each one.  She has requested GHAPE for an additional loan in order to purchase socks and shoes to be sold at retail.  After an exploration into various businesses including the management of a farm and raising of livestock, Rachel believes her shoe and sock sales will not only succeed but be her best business to date because she can sell year round and there is little environmental risk.  \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its

Just recently, she had the courage to undergo an operation to remove a cyst from her ovary. One of the reasons why she had to endure the ailment she had for so long was because she lacked the money to pay for the operation.  Moreover, she felt she had no one encouraging or supporting her morally.\r\n\r\nFilomina lives with her 69-year-old mother and she acts as a provider for herself, mother, and other close family relatives. It was through ASHI, one of Kiva's field partners in the Philippines, that she had savings which she used to spend for her operation. Loans from ASHI have also enabled her to start up and maintain a small \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store business. Little by little, Filomina\u2019s business is growing, but it's not growing as fast as she'd hoped because  the living expenses incurred by her family and the cost of her medicine is almost equal to her income.\r\n\r\nFilomina\u2019s health is now in better condition after her operation, and she's gotten good post-operative results from her doctor regarding her condition. She is excited to grow her \u201csari-sari\u201d store. She wishes to increase the inventory of goods in her store for the convenience of people in their village, which is far from the main market.

Collective farms, which worked only for the government, stopped functioning. The process of \u201cprivatization\u201d started. Families were given land according to the number of people in a family. Private businesses of cattle breeding and farming took place in the end of 20th century. Rosa I.\u2019s family also became land owners and their own story began. \r\n\r\n\r\nRosa I. is the treasurer of this group.  Rosa and her colleagues formed a group when applying for this group loan. Rosa\u2019s group members are not only close friends, but each of them is also a professional in farming. All of them are residents of a small town called Kochkor in northern Kyrgyzstan.  Fifty-two-year-old Rosa is the most experienced of the group.  She has been involved in farming for at least fifteen years. \r\n\r\nRosa is a proud mother of six sons and two daughters.  Her youngest son, a junior in college, is the only one still dependent on Rosa. Rosa and her husband, who is also a farmer, received land in 1995 and started cultivating it. This occupation brought enough revenue to purchase cattle and additional land in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan.  Now the family is hoping to get this loan to purchase more cattle, and spend the proceeds on a gift for Rosa\u2019s husband:  a long-waited automobile. \r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

After harvesting his crops, he sells them in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma where he has several customers who are aware of the quality of his produce and so do not hesitate to wait and buy all his produce wholesale.  What Crispin most likes about his work is sowing his land and making it fertile and productive.  He has been in this business for 22 years and he considers the most difficult part of his work to be spraying his fields as he has to do it very carefully since he doesn't want the chemicals to make him sick.  In the future, he hopes to continue selling his produce but, in order to improve his profits, he would also like to buy a car so that he can use it to transport his crops himself.\r\n\r\nThis is Crispin's first loan with MFP and he knows that he must make his repayments punctually if he would like to access another loan in the future.  He will use the 1,000 Peruvian soles he has requested to buy insecticides since he has to spray his
