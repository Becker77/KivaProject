Meet Amina, who is 52 years of age. She is a very hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer who lives in Kipsaina, a remote village in Kitale. She is happily married and has six children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland.\n\nLike many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 60,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry.\n\nThrough the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level.

She has been a GHAPE member since the very beginning of the organization and is now looking to take out her 9th loan from the organization. With this last loan, she is looking to expand her provision store, and she is hoping that she will be able to sell fruit and other foodstuffs in addition to the regular things to be found in a provision store, such as candles, soap, drinks, and dried goods.\r\n\r\nP. is sure that this expansion will be a success not only because of the larger selection of things that she will be able to offer to her customers, but also because of the loyal base of customers that she has as well as the experience that she has in running such a business. Because of this experience, she has been able to pick out a good business location, and has also been able to see that there is a much larger profit margin in selling fruit, as compared to other produce items.\r\n\r\nThis growth will benefit the community in that people will be able to have access to more nutritious food at any time that they would want to purchase it, and also because of the practices that P. has learned over time that aid in building her business.\r\n\r\nWith the profits of this venture, P. will be able to afford the drugs that she needs to stay healthy, and she will also be able to pay her grandchildren\u2019s school fees. In addition to this, she will be able to pay her rent and reinvest in expanding her business.\r\n\r\nPatrica originally came to GHAPE because of the long term repayment, lack of collateral and low rents. But since that time, she has found use in their training programs for business development, and also because of the follow up that GHAPE credit assistants and community members make to be able to be sure that people\u2019s businesses are succeeding and that they are getting all the help that they need to be able to stay successful into the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profit and loss, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

With the previous loan she bought materials to build a room but she couldn\u2019t finish it because she needs to buy more stone, zinc, concrete and other materials to finish the construction because everything is expensive and it\u2019s hard to build, nowadays one has to work really hard to achieve what one wants.  She thanks the institution for the support with the loan because she now has a roof for her daughter and privacy in her life.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sofia Burt, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":424105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Buy stone, concrete and zinc to finish building a room","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-10T22:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28.24,"local_amount":564.81,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":584.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601751},{"amount":28.06,"local_amount":561.2,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":580.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003194},{"amount":27.13,"local_amount":542.66,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":561.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841351},{"amount":27.68,"local_amount":553.57,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":572.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874266},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":574.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604164},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":556.55,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":575.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639628},{"amount":28,"local_amount":560.04,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":579.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821402},{"amount":55.33,"local_amount":1105.61,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1144.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561417}],"funded_date":"2009-11-11T01:30:20Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sofia Burt","image":1306467}},{"id":155579,"name":"Ana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana  I. is a 33-year-old woman living in the town of Auala 2.

He lives in a rented house with his family and his greatest desire is to get ahead in life.  His auto mechanic shop is one of the busiest in town because the cars come out well repaired after the rigorous repairs he provides.  He learned this skill at an early age because he has worked in other shops before which has made him highly skilled in car repair.  What he likes the most about his work is making the cars be like new since he puts in a lot of effort to repair them.  He has been in this line of work for 10 years and considers the most difficult part of it to be lugging the heavy replacement parts that he has to place in some cars.  For later on, he hopes to open a shop in a more centrally-located site in the city because his current shop is far.  This is Roberto's first loan with MFP and he wants to repay it without delay because he wants to have access to future loans.  With the fifteen-hundred new soles requested he will buy new replacement parts to better repair cars.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

They live in the community of Sirenachayocc, which is located in the beautiful forests of Cusco where they have their own house. Claudia knows very well that carrying out any activity depends on the work you do and the efforts you put in. That is why she puts all her time into agriculture, specifically the cultivation and commercialization of cacao and the coca leaf, thanks to the lessons her parents taught her. Her success is due to the quality of her product and the attention she gives to her clients. Generally, her products are sold in the market centers of her community, at competitive prices. This gives her much satisfaction for the work she has accomplished so far. Her priority is to expand her crops to other strategic areas to minimize cost and time. That way she will have good economic results. Generally, she receives help from her husband and together they make a good working team. Also, they are always trying to improve new techniques to care for their plantations, working from 7 in the morning to 6 in the evening. This is their second loan from MFP, for which she promises to comply faithfully with the payment obligations in a timely manner. She also feels strengthened and more secure with her communal group. With the requested loan, she will buy a small parcel of land to plant cacao seeds. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tania Mazumdar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":549359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy a parcel of land to grow cacao.

Benita has been engaged in her business for more than four years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Benita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Benita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from PMPC, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business. Benita is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to expand the business. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Benita from PMPC. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":563708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Expansion for the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Calamba-Sapang Dalaga Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":240}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":217708,"name":"Lilian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilian A. sells foodstuffs in a restaurant and is requesting a loan to stock more foodstuffs in her restaurant.

He owns a house that has neither electricity nor piped water. His greatest monthly expenses are food, medical fees, and school fees for his children.\r\n\r\nFor over twenty years, he has operated his snake park business from home for local people and foreigners.

She studied up to high school level and has her high school diploma.  She lives in Ahuehueyo, in the town of Ciudad Ayala, in the State of Morelos, in Mexico.\r\n\r\nMargarita has a business selling clothes and gifts.  She also sells (Jafra) perfume through catalogs and plastic products.  She will use her loan mainly to stock her business with merchandise such as men's and women's clothes.  She will invest in a (Jafra) perfume order, purses, leather bags and will also stock her business with toys for 'Kings Day' (January 6th - when children receive gifts from the Wise Men).\r\n\r\nMargarita found out about Kiva loans through a friend who invited her to take part in a group and decided to request support to set up her own business since she used to work as an employee.  Margarita has had her business for 25 years.  She started selling door to door and gradually attracted more and more customers until she decided to set up a sales location in her town.  She started out selling (Jafra) perfumes through a catalog and then leather bags that her sister brought her from Toluca.  She also brought shoes because they are cheaper there.\r\n\r\nSomething else that favors Margarita's business is the fact that she pays a very low rent on her business which is in Ahuehueyo market.  Her husband also supports her financially.  Margarita doesn't have far to travel from her home to her business since it is only two blocks away.  This means that she can walk.  Margarita's business is very important to her as it makes her the money she needs to cover her needs and, for that reason, she tries to benefit from it as much as possible.  Margarita likes selling and she normally works until 3.00pm every day.  It makes her very proud to have many customers of all ages who she sells to for cash and on credit.

She also comments that she likes work more and making crafts.  Her parents taught her how to make figures and pots since they too were artisans.  For the last 25 years she and her husband, Ausencio, started their own crafts business during the December season which is when most of the butterflies are sold; she paints them like Monarchs since the Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary is nearby.  She also sells pots to make pi\u00f1atas for the December season.\r\n\r\nThey have had a stand near the Zit\u00e1cuaro bus terminal for the last 15 years.  She sells her various crafts there.  They started out selling in Mexico City but when street vending stalls were banned they decided to return home to sell their crafts.  They have three children: Raquel who works and helps with household expenses, Esther, 15, who is in middle school and Elsi, 13, who is in elementary school.\r\n\r\nAngelina comments that now, thanks be to God, she\u2019s doing very well in her business but needs the loan to be able to invest and buy what they need to continue selling crafts like different colored paints to decorate them, clay, firewood, varnish, etc.  The goal she has for her business is to ask the municipal government to rent her a space where she can sell her crafts because the space she currently uses to sell her items is very small and she wants to display more of her crafts.\r\n\r\nThe other six group members are: Araceli, Leticia, Mar\u00eda Fernanda, Fernando, Anayeli, and Ana Velia.

She works everyday, 10 hours a day, and believes that things are going well because of her good performance and because of the friendly way she treats others. \r\n\r\nLissex is very grateful for the Kiva micro loans because they will help her buy a sewing machine which will help her, in the near future, open her own seamstress shop and increase her income."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1312107,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"purchase a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lissex Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":140.26},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":138.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":145.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":149.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":156.78},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":161.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":167.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":175.03},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":180.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":188.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":194.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":202.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.8},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":550039,"name":"Jackelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jackelina is 48 years old and lives in the Philippines.

He manages a motorcycle transport business and he earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2009, Lemuel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. He is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used for the repair and maintenance of his motorcycle used in his business. This loan will be his second loan taken from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support the immediate members of his family. \n\n\nAbout ASKI:\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Two of the children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nRosalie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in December 2007, in the hopes that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she was able to increase the family's income by engaging in her general store business. Now, she earns an average monthly income of 5,600 PHP from her business activities.\r\n\r\nRosalie is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of 11,000 PHP was used to fund the operation of her general store, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now, she is borrowing for her fifth loan, the amount of 13,000 PHP, which she intends to use on the general store. Rosalie is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":468666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Mar\u00eda managed to get ahead thanks to her own efforts, and she retained some of the people she used to have as clients. She went out to present her catalogs every three days and when people would call her to bring them. She plans to have a larger business so she can help meet her household expenses. The reason she is requesting this loan is to buy new catalogs and to supply as many orders for shoes that she has for pants. People hear about her business through the recommendations of others.

A. lives in the town of Moyotepec, municipality of Cd. Ayala, in the state of Morelos, Mexico. She is 41 years old. As a girl she studied basic education in primary school and finished high school in the INEA open system after marriage. She is going to use this loan principally to buy consumable products for her business: a griddle to toast pumpkin seeds, a gas grill, string cheese, tomatoes, chiles, sugar, tamale leaves, butter, meat, and chocolate.   \r\n\r\nMs. Antonia hopes to use a part of the loan to carry out some improvements to her home which will allow her to improve her business. Specifically, to put down a hard floor in the kitchen of her house. She has a business which sells tamales, atole (a maize drink), and toasted and ground pumpkin seeds for green mole\/pipian (a sauce for stewing). She started this business 10 years ago when necessity obliged her to take on an economic activity. She learned the trade from a cousin of her husband who taught her how to make tamales. Before dedicating herself to tamale sales, she had other activities; selling fruit and vegetables door to door, and selling hand-made tortillas and picaditas, and her business was going very well. As well, she sells mangos and grapefuit when in season.\r\n\r\nHer business is not fixed. She sells door to door on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays in her community. Her work, although heavy as she does it on foot, is important because it helps her to get her children ahead in school and with the household expenses. She enjoys the tasks of her trade, such as browning the seed and preparing the tamales. A big satisfaction she gets from her business is always having money for her necessities as well as for her pleasure. A moment of great pride for her was when, with some savings from her work, she bought material to plaster the walls of her house.    \r\n\r\nHer business principally helps housewives who, when they don't prepare something to eat, buy her products (tamales, mole, picaditas, etc.) We mention that on average she serves between 50 and 60 people. Some of the challenges she has confronted in her business are the constant rise in prices and harsh weather. \r\n\r\nMs. Antonia points out that her business is very important to her because it has helped her and her children to get ahead and she would like that through her work each day is better with her family and that they don't lack anything. She is pleased to receive this loan and feels a large responsibility to repay it. Ms. Antonoa wants to say to Kiva \"thank you very much for having confidence in me and giving me this loan because it is a big help for my business and for my family. Also, it gives me easy repayment terms and small interest.\" She likes her community because from here on clear days you can see the volcano (popocatepetl) and the hills, and it is open country. \r\n  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":681224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy a tortilla griddle to brown the seed, a gas grill, leaves for tamales, chiles, butter, cane, Oaxaca cheese, sugar, chocolate\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-03T21:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1159.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430793},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":773.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850051},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":773.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292324},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":386.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160589}],"funded_date":"2011-01-04T04:09:52Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa C","image":null}},{"id":266897,"name":"Johana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Johana tiene 22 a\u00f1os, vive con sus padres y hermanos en una casa propia.

centers in Uganda. The rising demand for this milk has been brought to pass by the increase in cheap milk supplies from Western Uganda, where most people rear sturdy milk producing cattle. This is a far cry from a decade ago when cow milk was scarce. In the present age, cheap cow milk outlets have opened up in almost every major town in Uganda. As a result, even those who could not afford milk in the past are in a position to buy it.\r\n\r\nA case in point is 45 year old Clement who does not purchase her milk for home consumption but for resale. She has been engaged in the cow milk sales business in Mukono for the past 12 years. Creating a good rapport with her milk suppliers has been playing to her advantage in many ways, principally the fact that she is supplied with milk every time her supplies run short.\r\n\r\nMukono, like many other Ugandan urban areas, now gets most of its milk supplies from traders who transport their milk from Western Uganda. Clement, a happily married mother of three, says she was pep talked into this business by her brother. Before that, she was engaged in a hides and skins sales enterprise. Weekly, her sales profits total 100,000 Ugandan shillings.\r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan, Clement plans to purchase more jerrycans of milk for resale."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":812050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more jerrycans of milk for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mukono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.25 32.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-15T10:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clement","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorothy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geofrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rukia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gideon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yunia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":950000},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":950000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":329.32,"local_amount":853234,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":858862.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227248974},{"amount":603.42,"local_amount":1563399,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-01T09:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1573711.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868544},{"amount":399.99,"local_amount":1036333,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1043169.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648378},{"amount":302.06,"local_amount":782600,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:20Z","rounded_local_amount":787762.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313743},{"amount":377.09,"local_amount":977001,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":983445.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275371},{"amount":183.26,"local_amount":474799,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-28T08:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":477931.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264223718},{"amount":4.86,"local_amount":12634,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-10T08:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":12717.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270319336}],"funded_date":"2011-07-18T02:57:04Z","paid_date":"2012-05-10T08:13:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diana Biggs","image":1109521}},{"id":320173,"name":"Luz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luz is 34 years old and lives in the Philippines.

He is a pillar of the family, since he is his mother's oldest son but also since he is the father of a 1-year-old child. \r\n\r\nMr. Gora has been a member of a branch of the micro-finance institution U-IMCEC since April 2011. He is requesting a loan of 500,000 francs for buying basic products (cement) that will allow him to make bricks and flagstones, which he markets. This financing will enable him to bolster his working capital, to grow his profits, and to develop his business further.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":862187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy cement","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2011-08-30T18:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cheikh Gora","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":42343.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232885317},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":42343.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238703433},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":42343.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244660601},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":42343.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250881315},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:58:46Z","rounded_local_amount":42343.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257290912},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":42343.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263433170},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:16:37Z","rounded_local_amount":42343.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270147122},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":42343.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276766899},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":42343.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283411472},{"amount":281.25,"local_amount":124999.97,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-17T08:17:35Z","rounded_local_amount":127030.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287817068}],"funded_date":"2011-09-15T15:04:03Z","paid_date":"2012-07-17T08:17:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":336576,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph is a business man.

This family lives in the warmth of their own home in the district of Palcamayo.  Thanks to his abilities and skill, Edgar has known how to carry out his activities with great efficacy.\r\n\r\nAs a child, he learned how to work the land at the side of his parents.  Currently, he has potato, olluco and oca (Peruvian tubers) crops.  At harvest time, his product sells very well at the wholesale market in Tarma.\r\n\r\nHe also has 250 heads of sheep and some cows.  With these animals, he was able to start a business selling meat.  \u201cFor each fair, I butcher 2 sheep and sell their meat, head, hide, and the hooves and giblets,\u201d he comments, adding that his business\u2019 profits hinge on capturing repeat customers.  To facilitate both activities, Edgar counts on a small truck that he uses to transfer his crops, animals and other products.\r\n\r\nIncreasing his tuber production is one of his goals, as well as opening meat sales stalls at the market in Tarma, which is why he continues to work arduously.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been growing potatoes and vegetables for 20 years.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her work is being able to see how the plants develop.  Selling all of her productions depends upon the growth of her plants.  She usually sells in the market in her city.  As a hard-working woman, she manages her money very well.  \r\n\r\nHer goal is to buy hectares of land in order to be able to plant potatoes and vegetables.  That way she will have stock for the customers she usually has in the capital.  That is where she travels to sell her production.  She is currently employing techniques to increase her sales.  Therefore, she hopes for support from each one of you so that she can carry out her proposal of buying farmland.  That way she will get greater income, which will allow her to provide her children with the quality of life that they deserve.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the Los \u00c1ngeles de Llanco Communal Bank.  This is her seventh loan with MFP.  She hopes to get a small loan in order to meet her objectives.  She pledges, once again, to make all of her payments as she has done with the previous loans she has had.  It pleases her to be part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible and very supportive people.  She will use the requested money to buy sacks of organic fertilizer to spread amongst her plants.  That way she will get a good production.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":793095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy sacks of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-20T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1242.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245252}],"funded_date":"2011-06-20T18:23:55Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":311992,"name":"Salome","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salome is 32 years old.

Thi Bay, 35 years old, joined the TYM Fund in 2006. Born in the rural area, she understands that she would face financial problems if her family only relied on farming. Right after she was married, she discussed with her husband to find a business that would stablise their family's economy, and they decided on selling pork. Everyday, her husband goes to the town market to buy pork which her sells at home whiL. Mrs. Bay then sells in the village market, bringing back a daily profit of 150,000VND (about 10USD). Since joining the Fund, her family has had more capital so their business has been even more smooth. Besides, she still has a source of income from farming and raising livestock. This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550.00USD) to further invest in her business. Her family's average monthly income is 6,000,000VND (about 400USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb L\u00ea Th\u1ecb B\u1ea3y 35 tu\u1ed5i.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling cooked food in her carenderia and she also had her sari sari store in the local community. Sherlina has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sherlina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sherlina is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Sherlina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She always enjoyed working and wanted to start another business.  Now her customers include her friends, relatives, and neighbors.  She goes to their homes to boost her sales by advertising whenever she has new products.  However, she considers her greatest challenges to be the location of her business because it is not visible from the outside, the lack of space, and insufficient capital.  To resolve these issues, her goal is to have a larger store in her main room that provides more space and is more visible from the street.\r\n<p>\r\nMuriel is currently requesting a loan of 2,000,000 COP.  Half of the money will be invested in the purchase of products for her business.  The other half will be used to improve her home by raising the ceiling because it is quite low.  Although this is her second loan, her husband has been associated with the Foundation for several years.  During this season, the two of them plan to acquire more supplies, attract more customers, and continue making more sales.  In addition, they hope to build a kitchen and add another room to their home.  Later on, Muriel dreams of completely remodeling her house and also providing her children with an education so that they can finish both high school and college.

She is 54 years old. Delia is the leader of a 5-member loan group sponsored by ASKI. Although each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for repaying the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Delia A. Group.\r\n\r\nDelia is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Delia owns and operates a general store where she sells a variety of different products in the local community. Delia has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Delia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Delia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Delia is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Delia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":527913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

This time, for her tenth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase raw materials for her food vending business. Her goal is to continue to save up for the future, specifically toward children's education and her family's needs. Anita P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, the Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon, a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable.\" Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass their dreams.

His children and wife live with him in his house.  His wife does catalog sales of makeup and shoes.  To help his wife out with the finances and to be a little more free with their expenses, they have their house payments deducted from Juan Hermilo's paycheck.  This is the second time they are seeking a loan with this organization.  They are very honest and hardworking people.

With his previous loan he was able to buy two cows at a time, and he would like to expand his business even further to generate more income. The other group members operate different types of businesses. Saidu has a small local restaurant, Mohamed B. buys and sells cows, and Hassanatu B. and Alphajor B. own small grocery stalls in the market. All would like to expand their businesses. They are requesting loans of approximately $275 US per member. Group members guarantee each other in case of failure to repay the loan by any member, and the group already has some savings and are saving additional money weekly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":150605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Capital for expanding several businesses:  livestock, restaurant, and grocery stalls","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kabala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.583333 -11.55","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-04-18T10:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibrahim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saidu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hassanatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alphajor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-02T18:55:18Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":138,"local_amount":401454.55,"processed_date":"2008-06-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":403236,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":225701},{"amount":138,"local_amount":401454.55,"processed_date":"2008-07-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:58:42Z","rounded_local_amount":403236,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":255042},{"amount":138,"local_amount":401454.55,"processed_date":"2008-08-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:00:21Z","rounded_local_amount":403236,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283771},{"amount":138,"local_amount":401454.55,"processed_date":"2008-09-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":403236,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":313923},{"amount":138,"local_amount":401454.55,"processed_date":"2008-10-02T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-03T07:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":403236,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":345269},{"amount":135,"local_amount":392727.25,"processed_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:04:47Z","rounded_local_amount":394469.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5345792},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":401775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9968352},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":401775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14884762},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:53:32Z","rounded_local_amount":401775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20434231},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":401775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128592}],"funded_date":"2008-04-18T18:55:18Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:43:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":48937,"name":"Hagar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hagar A. prepares food for sale and also sells plastics and provisions.

A temprana edad quedo hu\u00e9rfana de madre, era la mayor de 4 hermanos por lo que se hizo responsable de ellos, trabajando en la chacra de sus vecinos quienes le pagaban en productos (papa y ma\u00edz) que los compart\u00eda con sus hermanos. En vista de que le faltaba dinero se propuso criar cerdos y luego vend\u00eda la carne a sus vecinos. Al pasar los a\u00f1os, a base de mucho trabajo, compr\u00f3 sus propias tierras agr\u00edcolas, en ellas sembr\u00f3 papas y arvejas, algunas veces le result\u00f3 muy rentable, como tambi\u00e9n tuvo p\u00e9rdidas, pero jam\u00e1s desisti\u00f3 en su trabajo.

Espirita atiende su bodega mientras va conversando con sus clientes y brind\u00e1ndole un buen trato, puesto que valora la preferencia que le tienen, lo que le permite acumular dinero para cubrir la educaci\u00f3n superior de su hijo mayor, con los anhelos de que sea un buen profesional. Mientras tanto, Espirita sigue trabajando hasta terminar de educar a su hija menor a quien tambi\u00e9n ama mucho. Este es su cuarto cr\u00e9dito con MFP, durante los ciclos pasados demostr\u00f3 puntualidad en cada una de sus cuotas. En una oportunidad en que a su hermano le faltaba dinero para cubrir sus cuentas (ambos pertenecen al mismo banco comunal) ella pag\u00f3 la diferencia, lo que muestra que a\u00fan sigue pendiente de sus hermanos menores. El dinero que ahora viene solicitado es para la compra de fertilizantes para sus cultivos y en mayor parte para adquirir cuadernos y papales para su mini librer\u00eda. ","en":"Espirita is 52.  She is a very hard working woman, and she is a single mother.  She lives in her own house with her 18 year old son and her 11 year old daughter.  They are the motivation for her efforts.\r\n\r\nAt an early age she was left as an orphan without a mother.  She was the oldest of four siblings, so she became responsible for them.  She worked on the neighbor\u2019s farm, and they paid her in products (potato and corn), which she shared with her siblings.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that she did not have money, she set out to raise pigs.  She later sold the meat to her neighbors.  As the years passed, and after much work, she bought her own fields to cultivate.  She planted potatoes and peas.  Sometimes it was very profitable.  There were also losses.  But, she never stopped worked.  That was how she was able to build her house and set up a store in it.  As of nine months ago, she also has a small bookstore, which her daughter takes care of in her free time.\r\n\r\nEspirita takes care of her store while she chats with her customers.  She treats them well, and she appreciates them.  This allows her to accumulate money to cover her son\u2019s high school expenses.  The goal is for him to be a professional.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Espirita will continue working until she finishes educating her young daughter, who she also loves very much.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  During the past loan cycles she has demonstrated punctuality in all of her payments.  One time her brother did not have the money to cover his accounts (they both belong to the same community bank), and she paid the difference.  This shows that she still watches over her younger siblings.\r\n\r\nThe money that she is now asking for is to buy fertilizers for her crops. The larger part of the money is to buy notebooks and paper for her mini bookstore.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":343813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise and buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-27T15:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Espirita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1150,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3513.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717163}],"funded_date":"2009-06-27T18:18:39Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":122684,"name":"Ephraim Plus Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Henriette B. est vendeuse des haricots, \u00e9pices, et divers devant sa maison dans la partie nordique et la plus peupl\u00e9e de Kinshasa.

He is noted for being a very simple and hard-working father.  He lives in his own home together with his wife, 57 year-old Julia, and his three dependent children who he looks after with a lot of dedication.\r\n\r\nIgnacio's arduous workdays on his farm have helped him to improve his family's economic situation.  He and his wife are responsible for looking after their children's well-being and so they work as hard as they can, growing potatoes, peas, beans, corn and other vegetables.  They then take their produce to sell in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.\r\n\r\nWhat Ignacio most enjoys about his work is caring for his crops since he knows that healthy produce fetches a better price.  He has been in this business for 12 years and he considers the hardest part of his work to be having to climb the steep hills of Antabamba which is where he has his farmland.\r\n\r\nIgnacio has support from his wife who buys and sells cattle.  She fattens them up and then sells them on for a higher price.  In the future, Ignacio hopes to improve his farm and sow all of his land.\r\n\r\nIgnacio is a member of the \"Los Pinos de Antabamba\" (The Pine Trees of Antabamba) community bank and this is his sixth loan from MFP.  He hopes for a small loan which will enable him to reach his goals.  For his part, he pledges once more to make his repayments on time, as he has done with his previous loans.  Ignacio enjoys being a member of his community bank because all the members are responsible and very supportive people.\r\n\r\nIgnacio will invest the money he has requested in buying a bag of pea seeds, 20 sacks of Yungay potatoes, organic manure and natural fertilizers.
