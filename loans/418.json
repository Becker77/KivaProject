Rustam is a 43-year-old cattleman who is married with three children. Owing to his father, who was a farmer, Rustam has been associated with this business since he was young.

Every day, Rustam gets up early in the morning in order to feed his animals. And all day, until late at night, he is busy looking after the cattle.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Two of her children are currently attending school.\r\n\r\nMary is a farmer from Western Kenya near Kitale town. She has been farming for twenty-five years and has only one employee. Her main produce consists of maize, beans, avocados, passion fruit and sugarcane which she sells to the local market. She also sells dairy cows to the local market and earns income from a tailoring shop she owns in the area.\r\n\r\nMary is one of the many active clients in Juhudi Kilimo, having recently completed her fifth loan of KES 50,000. She has requested this new loan from Juhudi for KES 80,000 to purchase a tractor. This tractor will help her in her farming activities.\r\n\r\nMary\u2019s biggest challenge in farming came when she started to practice dairy farming since she did not have the know-how to keep dairy animals.

For more than ten years she has worked as a seamstress, making aprons used by housewives.  Her main piece of equipment that she uses for work is her sewing machine.  She has a sewing workshop inside of her home.  Even though her sister helps her with selling aprons, Antonia must travel to different places and neighboring cities.  Her business generates good earnings, thanks to the long hours of work she has performed.  Moving forward she wants to buy new sewing machines for her business and other equipment that she needs to keep her sewing workshop operating.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP.  Antonia is very happy to know that she has financial backing, which is why she has demonstrated that she is responsible with her payments.

Khursheed\u2019s husband works for a Municipal Corporation; however, his income is not sufficient for supporting the family. Therefore, Khursheed, with the help of a loan from Asasah, started the embroidery business to share the financial burden with her husband. Over the past few years, Khurseed has borrowed from Asasah three times and has maintained a good credit record every year.\r\nNow, Khurseed has applied for a new loan from Asasah, which will be her fourth one, and which she will use to expand her embroidery business by buying additional embroidery materials, such as beads, cloth, colored thread, and sketches. She hopes that the expansion will help her increase the business profits and, in turn, allow her to provide sufficient dowry for her elder daughter, who is nearing marriage age.

She only has a second grade education because her parents did not have the financial resources to provide for more education, so she began learning how to work in the home.  Years later she got married to Alfredo, who is a baker.  They have five children, four of whom are now married and the youngest who still lives with them and attends junior high school.  Maria and her family live in San Miguel Soyaltepec, Oaxaca.  The Cerro de Oro hydroelectric dam is located here, along with a lake that offers much fishing and work to the men of the community.\r\n \r\nShe tells us that her husband knows how to bake and work in a bakery, but a little more than six years ago he decided to start working his own business and taught her how to bake.

The two sons drive people in vans on local routes, while Salomat sells traditional Tajik flatbread at the market.  She has been doing this for several years.  Early in the morning one of her sons drives the flatbread to the market, helps her to arrange it on the counter and then leaves for his job.  One of the daughters helps Salomat to sell.  Salomat has many regular clients and she sells all of her flatbread in 3 hours.  5 months ago the price of flatbread increased slightly and Salomat decided to get a loan from MicroInvest.  The loan brought additional profits and since then she has been borrowing continuously.

To supplement her income, she rented a small store on the main street of her neighborhood and stocked it with groceries.  The store has been a real boon for her family, yet the cost of raising this large family prompts Rosa to seek other ways to apply her talents.  She has been knitting shawls in her free time and this brings in much-needed income.  Rosa feels that with more working capital the shop could generate more income, so she is asking for a loan of $325 to jumpstart the business and raise the family's standard of living.

children. Laura has been selling agrifood products for five years. She requested a loan of $1,000 from Al Majmoua in order to purchase merchandise for her work. This is her second cycle and she has always paid on time. \r\n<p>\r\nHer previous loans helped her improve her sales. Laura is an active woman who is always willing to participate in forums in order to sell her products. She is also very active within Al Majmoua, participating in several training sessions like vocational training, business-management training and lots more. Laura is special in her work because she is good with her agrifood products. Her clients are her friends, neighbors and others.

Currently she is continuing with the same business and tells us that it is going very well and that already she is well-known and has a good reception. \r\nWith this loan of 1500 PEN she will buy supplies to prepare her dishes, such as kilos of rice, sugar, potatoes, plantains, live chickens in crates; as well as some kitchen tools to replace the old ones. \r\n\r\nIsabel feels that she is a calm, happy, and successful woman with a desire to ensure a peaceful retirement. She would like to thank the Manuela Ramos Movement for helping her to fulfill her dreams and goals, as well as for helping other women who want to grow professionally. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

He is regretting that he did so, because his family comes first and he became mature as he knew life's real face early. Ali is requesting a loan from Al Majmoua for the second time in order to do necessary renovations to his shop such as changing the painting color, pasting floor tiles and fixing the shop's roof top. Ali might also change his chairs if he saves any money after making the requested changes. Through his last loan, Ali paid for an advertisement for his shop, which came with positive feedback and increased his clients and income at the same time.

T. is from Barranquilla.  She has three children aged 10, 12 and 23.  Her main business for the past 15 years has been making garments, costumes and casual clothes, especially for women.  She also makes other income because she has a sales location where, in addition to the clothes she makes, she also sells a variety of other products and offers a photocopying service.\r\n\r\nMartha sells her products through two commercial consultants and directly to companies and universities in the city.  She also sells her products from her sales location to passersby.  Martha started her business after having followed a course in dressmaking where she learned all the techniques necessary for designing, preparing, assembling and putting the finishing touches to women's dresses.  She developed her experience as she worked on other dressmaking projects.  When she was ready, she started her own entrepreneurial adventure.  She bought her first fixed assets and supplies and, for 12 years, she worked out of an apartment, in a small workshop.  However, her first business challenge was that customers didn't come to her workplace so she rented premises and moved her workshop.  She started to obtain the results she hoped for both in terms of sales volume and in number of customers.\r\n\r\nThis is Martha's second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and her first through Kiva.  She plans to use it to buy raw materials and supplies such as fabric, zippers and threads for making seasonal clothes such as school uniforms.  She will also stock her display cabinet with stationery and other products, taking advantage of the fact that her business is located in an area surrounded by students and teachers.  With her first loan, Martha managed to increase her working capital and improve her family income.  She is working on realizing her dream of increasing her production capacity, increasing her income and helping her children to become professionals so that they can have better opportunities in life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":733596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials and supplies such as fabrics, zippers and threads for making clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-03-20T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":98093},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":99973},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":101889},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":103842},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105832},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":107861},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":109928},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112035},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":114182},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":116365}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.71},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.73},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.8},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.07},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.21},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.71,"local_amount":98093,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":99523.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157482},{"amount":53.73,"local_amount":99973,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":101430.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230495},{"amount":54.75,"local_amount":101889,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":103374.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509347},{"amount":55.8,"local_amount":103842,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":105355.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673570},{"amount":56.88,"local_amount":105832,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":107374.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320126},{"amount":57.96,"local_amount":107861,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":109433.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803262},{"amount":59.07,"local_amount":109928,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":111530.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614347},{"amount":60.21,"local_amount":112035,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":113668.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568319},{"amount":61.36,"local_amount":114182,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:46Z","rounded_local_amount":115846.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779665},{"amount":62.53,"local_amount":116365,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:22Z","rounded_local_amount":118061.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188083}],"funded_date":"2011-03-21T18:34:18Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":287081,"name":"Lucia Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lucia Del Carmen tiene 52 a\u00f1os, su actividad es una pulper\u00eda.

Kunduzkan is a registered nurse by profession, but, given the low salaries of medical personnel, she had to seek an additional source of income of her family. After the Soviet Union had fallen apart, Kunduzkan decided to start her own business to sell children\u2019s clothing, shoes and school uniforms. With  a starting capital of 500 Soviet Rubels, Kunduzkan made a huge effort to grow her business and achieved success \u2013 now her monthly sales are about 30,000 KGS. The income from her business allowed Kunduzkan to purchase a Volkswagen Passat. In order to develop her business further, Kunduzkan turned to \u201cBai Tushum & Partners\u201d in order to obtain a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to stock up on seasonal goods for children.

Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":898184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buys seeds and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Sunakoti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-10-24T16:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Krishna Maya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T09:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1306.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647942},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1306.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865074},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1306.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275059},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1306.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416525},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-25T08:04:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1306.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270131326},{"amount":50,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-28T08:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3920,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947126},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1306.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283296514},{"amount":50,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3920,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294646172}],"funded_date":"2011-10-24T16:13:54Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T09:14:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":352681,"name":"Dimas Wilfrido","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dimas Wilfrido tiene 20 a\u00f1os de edad es soltero no tiene hijos, vive con los padres en el Cant\u00f3n Chillanes provincia de Bol\u00edvar.\nLA VRC MONTE DE LOS OLIVOS, se encuentra ubicada en la parroquia San Jos\u00e9 del Tambo a 60 minutos de la oficina conformada por 14 socios y socias.

A. was born in Niamey (Republic of Niger) on April 23, 1959.  Coming from a family of nine children, she could not continue in school.  So, at a very early age, she started learning how to make and sell corn mush.  She was able to save a little money from this business and expanded into general grocery items sold from a display located in front of her house.  Business is booming, allowing her to help with household expenses, since she is married and the mother of four.  Today, Ms. A. would like to go professional by opening up a shop, but she lacks the funds to do so.  She is therefore requesting a loan of $1,000 to open a shop, that she will call \u00abChez Yawano\u00bb and to widen the range of goods for sale.  Her experience as a merchant to-date will guarantee the success of her plans.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\nMadame A.

This is 52-year-old Daines from Dar es Salaam, a divorced woman with three children between the ages of 25 and 31 years. Daines has been operating a bar business since 2003. Her bar is a good place to relax with a beer if you manage to finish work early on a Friday afternoon. You can relax on a plastic chair under a tree, with a local beer in hand, the aroma of roasting 'mishikaki'  (kebabs made on an open fire) wafting around you, and talk to everyone who happens to wander by. <p>\r\n\r\nDaines 's business is doing well as she works 16 hours per day, seven days per week, assisted by three employees. She currently earns about $100 monthly and is requesting a loan of $250 in order to buy additional stocks of beer and soda. In the future, she plans to purchase more equipment including tables, chairs and glasses. Daines thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Basak, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a sugarcane plantation, a corn plantation and charcoal selling. Her husband Pablito, who is 58 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 12 children who are 11 to 35 years old.\r\n\r\nAnita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Anita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 20,000. She intends to use it to buy and sell charcoal so that she can continue to save up for their future and to send their children to school and expand her business. Anita D. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Her grandparents were the ones who started her in the business because they have a workshop. She even remembers that when she was a child and didn\u2019t behave, her grandfather punished her by making her turn the shirt collars or iron the pants pockets.  This was how she learned, and as a young girl, she decided to study and perfect the traD..  When she married, she bought a house and saw that there was no other tailor shop in the area, and she thought it would be a good idea to put one in since the area was starting to increase in population.  She wasn\u2019t wrong and she recognizes that her work has offered her the ability to pay the family expenses, especially because of the sudden illness of her husband.  Melita is the one who pays all and figures out how to handle everything.  Currently she is making school uniforms and sweatsuits for 2 schools.  She will use the loan to buy fabric to make sweatsuits.  What she would like most in the future is to fix up a place in her house where she can put a bigger workshop for the public and especially to buy industrial sewing machines since her goal is to produce the uniforms for all the schools in the area where she lives.  Melita is a member of the 8-person group \u201cLas Rosarinas\u201d.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He hopes that he can provide them with better a better future than his by giving them an education. With the loan he will invest in machinery for collecting the raise after it has grown. With the profits he hopes to make improvements to his home. <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Mario is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":25060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T17:18:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T02:54:27Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":825,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":117.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":118,"local_amount":118,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21388},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:14:41Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40776},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:08:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45295},{"amount":567,"local_amount":567,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:07:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":567,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99049},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:48:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106809}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T02:54:27Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:48:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11744,"name":"Nizami","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nizami N.

She learned the ropes of buying and selling fresh fruits and vegetables by working alongside her mother for 22 years. When she got married, she started her own business called \"La Guadalupana fruit sales\". She sells fruits both wholesale and retail, including apples, mangos, pineapples, and papayas. In the summer she specializes in selling fruits that grow in coastal low lands, and in the fall she sells elote, cooked corn on the cob. She travels every Saturday to the main market in the regional center of Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa to purchase her whole week's inventory and then returns back to her home where she sells the fruit.\r\n<p>\r\nCarmen is married and has 6 children ranging in age from 19 to 4 years old. Her husband works in the fields cultivating crops and brings home very little money due to the poor wages and seasonality of his work. So her income is an important part of supporting her family, and she is very proud to have the wherewithall to earn it. Her dream is to provide an education to all of her children. So far she has been successful. Her oldest daughter has already graduated and now is employed as a teacher. Paying back the loan monthly is another important goal which because of her own commitment she has been successfully doing. She realizes that by being in this program she can grow her business a little bit at a time and better herself and her family slowly but surly.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is a religious person and calls upon God to help her resolve the lingering problems with her first husband. She decicates her free time to working in her church and hopes that with God's help she can find her way though this challenge. \r\n<p>\r\nInterviewed by Lucia Tunay Ixcol<br\/>\r\nWritten by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva Fellows"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":70541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fruit for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro Yepocapa, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.504167 -90.956944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2007-09-30T23:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-15T01:42:01Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-11-15T10:21:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":81886},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-12-15T10:21:11Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97478},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-01-15T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116028},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-02-15T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":135750},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-03-15T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158364},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-04-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183035},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-05-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210563},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-06-15T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238684},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-07-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":267549}],"funded_date":"2007-10-01T01:42:01Z","paid_date":"2008-07-15T09:05:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24033,"name":"Zarif","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zarif has been in business for over 15 years.

Every year he makes a good profit from his land, and from his savings he purchased a car for the transportation of his crop.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Jenny started selling breakfast and lunch at her house, and little by little began buying food, a freezer, and plates to establish her restaurant \"Buffet 'J and M' Ketherine\",  which she has been running in her home for the past seven years.\r\n \r\nJenny has taken various cooking classes and began to teach in the municipality, as she works in the area of  workshop production.  She started her business when she began working with Finca (the microfinance partner).  Jenny is very grateful for all that she has been to do with the help of loans and the culture of saving money that she learned.  Finca gave Jenny a method to work with, and she likes the Bancomunal meetings where she can interact with other people who have a business vision like her own. \r\n\r\nJenny needs a loan of 3,000 Peruvian Soles to purchase kitchen utensils, cups, plates, and cupboards, because renting these goods is very costly.  Jenny's dream is to have her own home, and together with her children, continue with her restaurant.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Lucas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":260450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase material inventory for her restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenny Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":504.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397272},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":504.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088976},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":504.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982312},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":504.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442861},{"amount":316.68,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52953273}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T23:25:56Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:26:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Lucas","image":133535}},{"id":89592,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Julia S.

She is currently hoping for her fourth loan as she has made great progress since she first joined.  She is hoping for a loan in order to expand the number of items she sells through her food stand.  She would like to add flour, seeds, palm oil, bananas, and cocoyams to the items she currently sells.  Tanjong considers her business will succeed because she has always experienced strong sales through her food stand.  She expects the expansion of products available at her location will strengthen her offering as well as strengthen her relationship with her customers.<P>\r\n\r\nTanjong is an enthusiastic individual who, despite severe hardships, has managed to maintain a positive outlook on life.  Tanjong\u2019s most difficult loss was the recent passing of her husband.  She felt a deep pain at the loss of her spouse and leaned on her friends and family during her difficult time of mourning.  She considers the best manner by which she can contribute to her community is to provide healthy food as well as the option of a nice room in her house for a reasonable rent.      <P>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.<P>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":431465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of vegetables, fruit and palm oil for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

hog-raising businesses. Tirelessly making and selling her candy directly to people in the market to earn money for herself and her two children, Amparo also accepts as many orders for her product as she can accommodate.  She sometimes has to turn down orders due to insufficient capital, the same problem that affects her hog-raising business. Her desired growth for a hog after four months or so is often not achieved because she can\u2019t afford to buy the necessary food. This in turn reduces the profits she is trying to earn to make her life as well as her children\u2019s comfortable. <p>\r\n\r\nAlthough Amparo\u2019s two children are already 29 and 37 years old, she still feels responsible for making their lives worth living for. Her 29-year-old daughter, a high school graduate, is a contract-based sales lady in one of the stores in the province. Her other child is a special child who needs her financial and emotional support. With these considerations, Amparo would like to request a loan to finance her plan to grow her businesses. Once they are stable, she will have a valuable inheritance for her children to enrich and maintain in the future. Despite the fact that she is an elderly widow, her love and concern for her two children provide her with the strength to live and continue dreaming.\r\n

Dadap, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 46 years old. Mary Jane is married and has 4 infant-aged children. To make a living, Mary Jane owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling home products such as glasses, plastic wares, and watches in the local community. Mary Jane has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mary Jane joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mary Jane is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Mary Jane from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Just to mention one of them, she doesn't have a formal job. But her courage, perseverance, and desire to succeed make her get up every day to work on her poultry business. <br \/><br \/>She has been practicing mixed farming for the last 13 years and has gained much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her three children, she has been selling dairy milk, eggs, poultry, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in other small personal business. <br \/><br \/>The Kitale area is very populated, and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part of poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. <br \/><br \/>She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 80,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being an African woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. <br \/><br \/>Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets, and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions even more.<br \/><br \/>The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children. Roda always thinks and dreams big; that\u2019s why she wants to give the best quality of life to her children. You can help Roda to accomplish all her dreams, and a loan will do that for her."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1978254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2346.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2415.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2485.59},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2558.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2633},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2709.95},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2789.15},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2870.66},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2954.56},{"due_date":"2016-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3040.9},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3129.77},{"due_date":"2016-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3221.24},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3315.38},{"due_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3412.27},{"due_date":"2016-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3512},{"due_date":"2017-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3614.64},{"due_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3720.27},{"due_date":"2017-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3829},{"due_date":"2017-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3940.9},{"due_date":"2017-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4056.08},{"due_date":"2017-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4174.61},{"due_date":"2017-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4296.62},{"due_date":"2017-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4422.19},{"due_date":"2017-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4551.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.86},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.58},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.1},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.89},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.71},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.41},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.3},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.21},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.15},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.12},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.12},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.15},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.2},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.29},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.41},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.56},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.75},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.22},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":992745,"name":"Jemelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jemelyn is 33 years old and married with three children.

She would also like to help her children be able to study.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":304081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Comprar materiales de construccion para hacer un muro en la parte de atras","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-04-16T19:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":61.36,"local_amount":1227.29,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1242.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890840},{"amount":61.08,"local_amount":1221.62,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1237.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63112147},{"amount":60.57,"local_amount":1211.39,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1226.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533549},{"amount":61.03,"local_amount":1220.57,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1235.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964911},{"amount":61.85,"local_amount":1237,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:46:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1252.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875365},{"amount":54.11,"local_amount":1082.13,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713306},{"amount":67.26,"local_amount":1345.16,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1362.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601007},{"amount":60.25,"local_amount":1204.97,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1220.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118002487},{"amount":60.46,"local_amount":1209.18,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1224.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123840667},{"amount":52.03,"local_amount":1040.69,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1053.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128873620}],"funded_date":"2009-04-18T22:59:07Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Hubman","image":226625}},{"id":105992,"name":"Ludy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ludy L. is 41 years old, residing at Gango, Ozamiz City with 2 children, and her husband is a tricycle (three-wheeled vehicle) driver in the City of Ozamiz.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She tells us that the small house in which they live is very old, and they are in the process of constructing a new one, but the family was missing the resources necessary for the completion of the project.  For this reason, they are now asking for a loan which will be used to purchase construction materials so that Judi can achieve her dream to finish the construction of her house to give her family,

The name for the group came from a perfume brand name that they like and this is how their group is identified.  \r\n\r\nElaine has been working in catalog sales  for fifteen years and she is requesting a loan to buy more merchandise. She wants to  increase her business income as she needs to buy the merchandise first and then sell it.  She started this business to earn some money since she is a single woman with no one supporting her.  She needed to earn money to support herself and help her family with the household expenses.  With the income she is earning from her business she will buy more merchandise in order to be well stocked and keep her customers satisfied.  She will also be happy to make money on every product that she sells.  She wants her business to grow a little more every day so that she can rely upon it and get ahead.  What she desires most is to be able to buy construction materials to build a house.

Most of her customers are people who used to wake up early in the morning for work or studies who do not have enough time to cook for themselves and still others are tricycle operators and drivers who just parked their units in front of her store while waiting for passengers. Rhodora and Antonio gather a net income of PHP 10,000 monthly, which they use to meet the needs of the entire family.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 22,000 loan. Rhodora plans to use this loan to further her food vending business and to finally install their own electrical power supply.  Basically, the loan will serve as additional capital that will enable Rhodora to make her business more profitable and lead to more savings.\r\n\r\nAt present, Rhodora experiences complaints from her customers about the quantity of her food serving because she just adjusted it due to increasing prices of the raw ingredients she uses at present.  She is determined not to be swayed by these struggles, explains to them these adjustments and aims to make her business grow.  Rhodora dreams of seeing her children finish their studies and be used as one family for the glory of the Lord whom they serve.  As a CCT community partner, Rhodora attends faithfully to their weekly fellowship* meeting where she can draw inspiration and strength from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.

Afterwards, she got together with her friends and neighbors to create what became the group. All the women united around the proposal of improving their condition of life and that of their families.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Andresa who has a notions shop where she sells all sorts of articles, including items of clothing, gift articles, and other things.

This area has harsh weather conditions and to survive, you must have tough skin, but Mary has defied all the odds and has been engaged in farming for the past nineteen years. Her primary sources of income are crops and animal farming. She also gets some income through personal business. \r\n\r\nMary is contented with the farming way of life. Mary is a very enterprising woman, and although she never had formal employment, she has always worked hard on her farm and she has always assured her children and family of a decent meal. The Kitale area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to buy seedlings and start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business. Because of these factors she will be able to sell her horticulture products both in the local and international market. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Mary feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising women like her. Mary is well disciplined with finances and she plans that through the accumulated profits, she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children.

James lives in a town called Ruai on the outskirts of Nairobi. James is a businessman. He runs a general shop which is situated at the Ruai Center. James started off as a waiter in a hotel from the year 2002-2003, but he decided to quit the job due to poor working conditions including a very low salary. In the year 2004, he started a green grocery stand with savings which he earned from his previous job. Through the profits that he earned from the grocery, he expanded his business and started selling cereals and stocking items like sugar, flour and salt.\r\n<p>\r\nJames's business has been doing well, although he finds that he has been unable to increase his stock due to lack of finances since he has a business to run and also a family to support. As a result, his business has come to a standstill while he has been wondering where he can get money since the few banks that he tried to approach charged high interest rates that he felt he could not pay. While still wondering about this, he noted that his friend and neighbor, Mary Wamaitha, who is a beneficiary of a Kiva loan, had suddenly raised her business from nowhere, and it was growing fast. He therefore inquired how she had managed to do it so quickly, and she informed him about Kiva. He was greatly impressed. Mary went further and brought him to the ANK offices so that he could also receive support. \r\n<p>\r\nJames is kindly requesting a loan of US$650 which he will use to stock his shop with cereals like maize, peas, beans, rice, sugar, and flour, among other items. He believes that, with this loan, he will be able to expand his business and increase the number of customers he has. This way, he will be better able to support his family. Since he is a young person, he also hopes that he will be able to expand his business up to a wholesale level over time.\r\n<p>\r\nThe repayment period for this loan will be 9 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":99820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase stock for a general store, including cereals like maize, peas, beans, rice, sugar and flour etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ruai, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2008-01-01T08:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-15T15:06:01Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-02-15T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":135692},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-03-15T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158282},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-04-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182975},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-05-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210469},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-06-15T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238604},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-07-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":267485},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-08-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":296683},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-09-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-16T07:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":327299},{"amount":66,"local_amount":4061.54,"processed_date":"2008-10-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-16T07:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4138.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":360799}],"funded_date":"2008-01-01T15:06:01Z","paid_date":"2008-10-16T07:04:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":32257,"name":"Ludmila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Ludmila is an enterprising business owner from Pavlograd in central Ukraine.

G.  es un se\u00f1or de 58 a\u00f1os de edad, quien vive en una casa propia junto a su esposa ya que sus cuatro hijos ya viven fuera de la misma. \n\nLa comunidad en la cual vive don H\u00e9ctor se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nDesde hace tres a\u00f1os don H\u00e9ctor se involucr\u00f3 en la tarea de producir leche y queso como una forma de generar ingresos para su familia. Sumado a esto, hace dos a\u00f1os se  instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos, propiedad de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce, motivo por el cual  le vende sus productos a esta planta. \n\nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive don H\u00e9ctor  es famoso en todo Costa Rica. Es un queso fresco que se le conoce tradicionalmente como \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d. A los \u201cticos\u201d (como se les conoce a los habitantes de Costa Rica) les gusta mucho consumir este producto; se le encontrar\u00e1 en las mesas acompa\u00f1ando cualquier tipo de comida, especialmente en los desayunos  junto a tortillas, arroz, frijoles, huevos, el t\u00edpico \u201cgallo pinto\u201d, entre otra variedad de comidas.  Por esta raz\u00f3n, el mercado para dicho producto es realmente bueno.\n\nLo que desea don H\u00e9ctor por el momento es obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito para comprar una vaca lechera m\u00e1s y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche. El sabe que contar con una vaca m\u00e1s es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo pero dice que si quiere sacar su familia adelante tiene que esforzarse en producir m\u00e1s. \n\nDon H\u00e9ctor  es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la micro financiera EDESA. Gracias a su vinculaci\u00f3n con esta organizaci\u00f3n ha obtenido ya 5 micro cr\u00e9ditos y los ha cancelado satisfactoriamente.

Their four children are grown up and live on their own.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The community where Hector lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, in the province of Cartago.  It's a small rural community of approximately 2000 people.  The residents of the community work primarily in dairy (milk production) and cultivation of coffee.  The local terrain is a bit rough, and the climate is that of tropical forest.  There are many picturesqe paths running through the area that combine the tropical forest with two pretty lakes, along with coffee plantations and dairies.  El Sauce is about one and a half hours by bus from Turrialba, the closest commercial zone.  However, many times during the year the road is impassable due to the rains.  This is no doubt one of the disadvantages of the community.   <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> When there is no work, many people opt to leave to look for work in Turrialba, or on banana farms located in the Atlantic zone of Costa Rica.  Lately, the prices for coffee and milk have gone up, so more people are trying to work in the area instead of migrating away.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> For three years Hector has worked producing milk and cheese to generate income for his family. To help with the local economy,  two years ago a cheese factory was set up in the community, and now Hector can sell his milk to the cheese factory.   The cheese from this region is famous in all of Costa Rica.  It's a fresh cheese that is traditionally known as \"cheese of Turrialba\".  The \"Ticos\", as the people of Costa Rica are known, like this cheese a lot and you will often find it at meal times served with all sorts of food, especially at breakfast.   They eat the cheese with tortillas, rice, eggs and beans amongst other dishes.   For this reason, demand for the cheese if very high. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Hector would like a loan to buy an additional dairy cow and increase his production.   He knows that another cow means a sacrifice and much more work, but he says that if he wants to continue to support his family, he will need to produce more.    Hector is a client of the Association of Producers of El Sauce, a local organization affiliated with the micro finance entity EDESA.   Thanks to his involvement with this organization, Hector has been given 5 micro loans, all of which he has paid back on time.    The new loan will be used to purchase the additional dairy cow.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Charnes, Kiva

Bashorat, a 44-year-old woman, is married with three children. Bashorat cultivates a small farm, which she has done for more than five years. She grows different types of vegetables and wheat. Everyday she gets up very early. At 5 am, she drives to the produce market in the capital to sell her products, while her husband and sons take care of the daily work on the farm. \r\n<p>\r\nBashorat is very proud of the work they've done together as a family, and grateful that they've been able to acquire the comforts they have in their home. They have made good use of loans, since nowadays it's very difficult to get ahead without the extra help. Bashorat has applied for a loan from IMON International for the first time. This loan will be used to buy fertilizer, seeds and insecticides that they need for their farm.   \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Bateyes typically lack potable water and any kind of reliable electricity, and have far from sufficient medical services.
