Due to the fact that it is too difficult to take care of the family singlehandedly and that her husband could not provide for the children's basic care alone, Mary decided to joint GHAPE in 2000. She has been having many marital problems with her husband\u2019s brothers, which has made her sad all the time but she is appreciative of the fact that she is alive. Her desire is to give her children love and education. She states that she feels better each time she provides something small for her children. Mary's inability to get investment capital to generate income to meet her children\u2019s needs is what motivated her to obtain a loan from GHAPE.\r\n.\r\nWith this loan, Mary plans to buy a two wheeled motorcycle. She knows this business will succeed because she is located at a good business site and she has a good rider for the motorcycle. In addition, Mary has saved money that she can now withdraw to purchase her bike. This is the reason that she asks for only 50,000 XAF. She plans to use the profits generated by the business to sponsor her children in school and to provide for her family's basic needs. She plans to pay her loan in 24 months. The first installment of repayment will be made on the fourth month of loan disbursement. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as candies, biscuits, napkins, shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc. in the local community. Rosela has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosela joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC which was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Rosela is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan Rosela has taken out from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Police officer and Trisikad driver to earn a living. They have no children. \r\n\r\nWena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Wena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to purchase raw materials so that she can improve her business, repair her house and have savings in the future. Wena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started her adventure in business four years ago with a loan she got from a firm that sells the products she sells via catalogue.  With it she purchased a code and started selling cosmetics, women\u2019s accessories, silver jewelry and derivatives.  Very soon her business started to grow because she would reinvest her profits into it and being supported by her spouse who has helped her during the times of greatest challenge she faced at the beginning because she would not recuperate her credit capital as fast as she had planned to.\r\n\r\nLuz Marina dreams with her business\u2019 growth and expansion and this is why she\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy a small display case and cosmetics that are on sale for the end of year that she\u2019ll use to stock up to be ready for the season of highest sales at Christmas and New Years; she will be able to display them better and have the best sales of the year.\r\n\r\nFinancial indicators show her business to be profitable and with much growth potential according to its characteristics because she currently has a profit margin of 34%, an indicator from which she starts to continue raising her expected sales having new working capital from her Kiva loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":939977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

This is 26-year-old Mary M.. She is married and has three children aged two, six, and nine. She also has two additional dependents that she cares for. In 2000, Mary established her genge (small shack selling groceries). Working seven days a week, and  one to four  hours a day, she earns about 90 USD every month from this business, in which she is assisted by her husband. Mary requires a loan in order to purchase more sugar, rice, soap, and cooking oil in bulk. In the future, Mary plans to expand and establish another business. She thanks you for your support.  \r\n<P>\r\nThe Swahili word for an outdoor shop or stall is \"genge.\" A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general grocery items such as onions, tomatoes, chiles, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people usually send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and discover they are missing an ingredient.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192577,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more sugar, rice, soap, cooking oil in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T19:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T20:24:07Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356207},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347949},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970523},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886740},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436000}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T20:24:07Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65440,"name":"Noor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ten years ago, this 46-year-old man was a military officer, but now he has a bicycle repair shop.

He plans on contributing by providing labor and will use the loan to buy materials. \r\n\r\nWhile he has had many trials in his life, from the loss of a child to the death of his mother, P. continues to provide for his children and their needs. P. has been with GHAPE for almost a decade and continues to use them as a resource because he feels comfortable with \u201ctheir ways.\u201d\r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":285659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Foncha St, Nkwen, NW.

Cecelia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC. Cecelia is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP' which will be used to purchase additional seafood products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Cecelia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Because of the opportunity to take out loans, Rosemarie was able to start a business she thought she could be successful at: fishing. \r\n\r\nShe is courageous enough to take all the risks of running this business because her husband is there to support her and because of a dream she keeps in her mind of  having all her children finish their schooling through college. \r\n\r\nRosemarie has kept on taking loans from ASHI to keep her business growing. Now, she plans to use her new loan to buy equipment needed for her fishing business, such as a new boat, fishing nets and other supplies so that her husband will catch more fish to sell. If ever the couple gets better output, they will be able to invest more in their business and in their home.\r\n\r\nRosemarie's only hope is that her children not experience the hard life she and her husband experienced. She dreams of expanding her fishing business. Her long term goal is to build a new, spacious, concrete home to live in.\r\n   \r\nRosemarie and her husband help each other to achieve their dreams of offering a better life to their children. The couple says thank you to Kiva and ASHI for offering financial support to her business

She is 41 years old. Rosel is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Rosel owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Rosel has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rosel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. Rosel is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Rosel from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Thus, our advanced planning will serve the population of the ecovillage.\r\nTranslated from French by V\u00e9ronique Fourment, Kiva volunteer.\r\n\r\nSuite \u00e0 une pluviom\u00e8trie d\u00e9ficiente pour cette ann\u00e9e, le Regroupement des Femmes de Popenguine pour la \r\n\r\nProtection de la Nature a d\u00e9cid\u00e9  de cr\u00e9er une banque de c\u00e9r\u00e9ales pour pr\u00e9parer les prochains mois, car \r\n\r\nles r\u00e9coltes ne sont pas bonnes. C'est pour cela que pour la premi\u00e8re fois nous demandons un \r\n\r\nfinancement afin de pouvoir acheter des arachides, du mil, du ma\u00ees et des fruits de baobab pour stocker ces \r\n\r\nproduits. En ce moment, nous voulons profiter de la campagne de commercialisation pour achater le \r\n\r\nmaximum possible de grains, car nous savons que la famine risque de se faire sentir cette ann\u00e9e et que \r\n\r\ncertainement la p\u00e9riode hivernale va \u00eatre tr\u00e8s dure. Ce qui fait que nous pourrons venir fournir les \r\n\r\npopulations de notre \u00e9covillage en denr\u00e9e alimentaire. Ainsi, la pr\u00e9vision que nous aurons fait servira \u00e0 la   \r\n\r\npopulation de  l'\u00e9covillage"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":118375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

Mrs. H.\u2019s husband is not only a farmer but also a construction worker, earning about 2.000.000 VND per month. The family\u2019s financial situation is relatively good compared to that of other families in her neighborhood. When TYM Fund opened its branch in her area, Mrs. H. didn\u2019t hesitate to participate in the program and request loans. Because the loan of the first round was limited, Mrs. H. could only take out 500000 VND and used it to breed chickens. As the amount of loans that can be borrowed increases annually, Mrs. H. has used them to raise pigs and cows. The family\u2019s situation has been improved a lot as a result, which allows the family to purchase necessary furniture for their house. Her two children who are working make 3.000.000 VND per month, which helps the whole family a lot. In the next round of loan, Mrs. H. would like to borrow 11.000.000 VND ($ 675) to keep investing in poultries. Her family\u2019s monthly income is 6.000.000 VND.<p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Khoa Nguyen, Kiva

needs vegetables. S. Asomidin has been selling vegetables in Dushanbe Central market for the past 2 years. He began his own stall with his hard-earned savings as he had always wanted to be an entrepreneur. Asomidin began selling vegetables at the market with very little stock to offer his clients. Slowly he began to increase the goods offered until he managed to get a permanent market stall. Currently his stall is his pride and joy with a zinc roof and ceramic tiles on the floor. Asomidin is a father of two children who are in school. Like any father, he is doing his best in order to ensure his children the best future and to make them well educated. Now he needs a loan for a size of 4000 Somoni in order to increase the stock of his selling goods. He promises to repay the loan within 9 months and expresses his gratitude to everyone supporting him.  <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Agricultural work is part of his life.  He is a noble and charismatic man, but above all he is very devoted to his farming.  When we visited him, we found him harvesting potatoes at seven in the morning and smiling with the joy that this chore brings him.   Afterward, he gets his produce ready and transports it to be sold in the city markets.  Growing potatoes is very profitable for Alberto.  Although it's a lot of work to produce them, he feels very satisfied with the prices at market.  This motivates him to continue planting them, in order to improve the quality of life for his young children.  Alberto plans to increase his plantings but he doesn't have his own fields.  This doesn't discourage him.  He will continue farming on rented farmland until he is able to buy his own.

He attended school through the 10th grade and he received training as an elementary teacher.\r\n<p>\r\nHe left Gaza Province for Namaacha, a town on the border with Swaziland, with his parents after his father was transferred through his work in education. After completing primary education, his mother advised him to enroll in the training course for primary teachers as a fast path to entering the job market. Fulgencio completed the course in two years and quickly went to work as an administrator in the District Administration Office of Education in the same town of Namaacha.

He has not been able to save because he is building his residence in the town of Boane, which is located 75 km away from the town of Namaacha. he has not been able to complete the construction, so he approached Hluvuku requesting a loan to continue the work. He obtained this with a little bit of difficulty due to lack of collateral, but with the help of his uncle as a backer, he was able to overcome this barrier and continue the work. He takes care of his mother and his two younger siblings who live in the city of Maputo by sending them 1000 meticais per month. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Fulgencio's second loan from Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. The first 10,000 meticais were used to buy construction material to start the project, since he already has part of the land.

They live in traditional domestic families with their brothers, sisters, co-wives, children, and husbands. These women live in the Massabla-coura section of Bougouni village in the third administrative region of Mali. They know each other through marriage and the grain trade. In order to stock grain and increase their financial resources, they have decided to join together at the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. As a group, they are on their sixth loan; they successfully repaid their first five loans. With this loan, they intend to buy 6 tons of corn, 500 kg of fonio (a West African grain), and 3 tons of millet. They purchase the products from suppliers in villages surrounding Bougouni and then resell them at retail prices at the Bamako market. Their customers are primarily men, and sales are made in cash. With this loan, the women each envision receiving a monthly profit of 50,000 FCFA to be used depending on each woman's individual activities.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":432955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of Grains","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amin Ata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100627.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763579},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":100627.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152411},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":100627.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991253},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":100627.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021523},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100627.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746325},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":100627.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778877}],"funded_date":"2009-12-07T01:16:27Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelly Percival","image":null}},{"id":159913,"name":"Keji","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Keji A. bakes and sells local Sudanese bread.

She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Christina has 5 years of experience in this business.  Christina needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Christina joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Christina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Christina P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Mayo y con ello d\u00eda en que Colombia conmemora a las madres, creado originalmente como \u201cun d\u00eda D. madres por L. paz\u201d, que luego se convirti\u00f3 en un d\u00eda para cada familia en honor a su madre y se ha convertido en una fiesta en muchos lugares del mundo. En este mes D. Mayo se genera una gran din\u00e1mica comercial, porque se hace reconocimiento no solo a las madres biol\u00f3gicas, sino a todas las mujeres madres, o a quienes ocupan el papel D. madre. D. aqu\u00ed se derivan  hermosos detalles y regalos dirigidos por j\u00f3venes, adultos, ni\u00f1os, hombres y mujeres, a  suegras, hermanas, cu\u00f1adas, amigas y vecinas. Esta es L. raz\u00f3n por L. cual Olga Katherine D. L. R., mujer D.  gran experiencia en mercadeo, se prepara, invirti\u00e9ndole al negocio una mercanc\u00eda ajustada a esta celebraci\u00f3n, para hacer su oferta en el mes D.

Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. Olga dice que los cr\u00e9ditos logrados en esta organizaci\u00f3n,  le han servido para solventar su econom\u00eda familiar, porque cuando elL. se inici\u00f3 como comerciante  en el a\u00f1o 2006, vend\u00eda solamente mercanc\u00eda y ten\u00eda pocos clientes, y generaba pocos ingresos para su familia;  ahora no solo son familiares y vecinos sus clientes  sino tambi\u00e9n referidos D. sus amigos y ha logrado mas utilidades, porque adem\u00e1s agreg\u00f3 otro negocio: el D. servicio D. fotocopiado e impresiones que le da L. oportunidad D. compartir su tiempo, entre las actividades productivas, reproductivas y dom\u00e9sticas. Ahora sue\u00f1a con tener su propia casa, sacar adelante L. educaci\u00f3n D. sus tres hijos en las edades D. 1 a 9 a\u00f1os, incrementar su negocio en ventas e infraestructura, y sobre todo continuar con su servicio D. calidad en L. atenci\u00f3n a su especial clienteL., porque Olga Katherine, vive en el popular barrio CiudadeL. 20 D. Julio, y su ubicaci\u00f3n L. aprovecha muy bien, teniendo en cuenta que en \u00e9l interact\u00faan residencias familiares, negocios estacionarios y ambulantes y est\u00e1 muy cerca al Estadio Metropolitano D. BarranquilL., escenario seD. del equipo D. futbol muy querido por los coste\u00f1os \u201cEl Junior\u201d      \n\n","en":"May is approaching, and with it the day that in Colombia commemorates mothers, created originally as \"a day of mothers for peace\", which later became a day for each family to honor its mother and has become a holiday in many parts of the world.  In this month of May sales are high because recognition is given not only to biological mothers, but to all women who mother, or who fill the role of mother.  Beautiful tokens and gifts are given by youths, adults, children, men and women, to mothers-in-law, sisters, sisters-in-law, friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason Olga Katherine D. L. R., a woman experienced in marketing, prepares by stocking her business with merchandise tailored to this celebration, to sell in the month of May; she also decorates her other business, where she offers photocopy and printing services, with motifs expressing love for mothers.  She has done this for four years, the time in which she has run her business.  Now her customers have given her orders for dresses, perfumes, and purses, and she needs a loan for 1500 Colombian pesos to be able to fill these orders.  She is asking for her fifth loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.\r\n\r\nOlga says the loans she has received from this organization have helped her cover her household expenses, because when she began her life as a businesswoman in 2006, she only sold merchandise and had few customers, and earned little for her family.  Now her customers are not only relatives and neighbors but also people referred to her by their friends, and she has maD. more profit because she also added another business:  the photocopy and printing service that gives her the opportunity to diviD. her time among business and domestic activities.\r\n\r\nNow she dreams of having her own house, moving ahead with the education of her three children (ages one to nine years old), expanding her business' sales and infrastructure, and above all continuing with her quality service to her special customers, because Olga Katherine lives in the popular CiudadeL. 20 D. Julio neighborhood, and her location is very advantageous for her.  In the neighborhood there are family residences, shops and traveling businesses, and it is very near the Metropolitan Stadium of BarranquilL., the home field for the \"El Junior\" soccer team, which is very popular with the coastal residents.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

All members live in the Cuenca area.  For both domestic and foreign tourists, this beautiful Ecuadorian city offers gorgeous natural scenery and the beauty of its historic center, home to historic remains such as the museum and Immaculate Conception Cathedral, one of the largest and most beautiful in America, as well as others dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries.  Its cobblestone streets and houses with facades typical of the republican era give witness to the different European influences, with noble balconies and artistic ceilings.  The city is also known as the \u201cValley of the Andes,\u201d or the \u201cAthens of Ecuador,\u201d because it is the cradle of illustrious men and poets, who have made the city famous.  For this occasion we are joined by Eulogio Rojas, coordinator of the Azuay regional area, along with members of the Women for Progress Communal Bank.\r\n\r\nJennifer G. lives in downtown Cuenca, is 26 years old, married, and has a two-year-old child.  Her husband is a graphics designer in his father-in-law\u2019s printing house, who took this over eight years ago.  They do not have their own home at this time, but share a house with their in-laws, along with its expenses.  Jennifer also works in the printing house, providing professional services in the accounting area, for three years now working from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., with the rest of her time devoted to her child.\r\n\r\nShe has been working with loans from this bank for three years now, thanks to her mother\u2019s invitation to join this lovely group of enterprising women.  The loans have served her for household expenses and for her husband\u2019s printing house.  Her next loan will go to purchase a printing press for the business.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to have her own home.\r\n\r\nFlora is 63 years old, and lives with her lawyer husband in her own home, achieved through their own efforts.  They have three children, 35, 32, and 30 years of age, who are married and independent.\r\n\r\nFor eight years, Flora Campo has worked in the bank, being invited by a colleague from the artisans\u2019 union, as she has been a seamstress by trade for fifty years, which she learned from her mother.  She has a small shop in her home, where she fulfills orders, working from Monday to Saturday on a schedule that varies.  With her next loan, she will buy fabric, thread, buttons, zippers, clasps, etc., to supply her workshop.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to see all of her children in their own homes, which will bring comfort to the family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband passed away a few years ago and left her with their two children: Melody, 36, and Mariyon, 34.\r\n\r\nWhen Amelita joined ASHI seven years ago, cooking and selling native foods was her business. She is thankful that ASHI provided her with capital during those times. From her income she was able to send her children to school and have them finish their choice of degree.\r\n\r\nAgain, Amelita is applying for a loan of Php 25,000 to use as capital for her food-production business. She needs this amount to buy raw materials like rice, sugar, coconut, other ingredients, banana leaves, firewood and additional cooking tools. The demand for her delicious product has increased and that is why, even at her age, she keeps on cooking and producing native food products.\r\n\r\nAmelita\u2019s dream is for her business to prosper for her family and for her to enjoy life to the fullest. ASHI and Kiva are a great help in the realization of her dream and she conveys her thanks to both institutions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":589998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Now that she and her husband Mamerto, have secured access to capital, her profits have improved. For that reason, she is now requesting another ASHI loan through Kiva for a much larger amount. Specifically the loan fund will be used for buying raw materials needed for her business.  This will enable her to grow their business further so that they will have savings in the future. Her long term dreams are to continue supporting her children as well as building a stronger home that can withstand flooding common in her province. \r\n\r\nA dedicated member of ASHI since 2007, Rhodora has been a model member demonstrating regular attendance at weekly meetings and timely repayments on loans.

Desde muy ni\u00f1a aprendi\u00f3 esta actividad y hoy es toda una experta en el manejo del crochet. En adelante piensa agruparse entre varios socias y brindar prendas tejidas a los clientes.

She lives in her own home in the company of her husband and their 3 children. For 7 years she worked as a seamstress but now she decorates sweaters with crochet accents, work that she carries out at home to keep an eye on the kids. She feels accomplished in this work and she enjoys doing it. She knows that the more she produces, the greater her earnings. She tries to work as fast as possible, especially in the afternoons when she has completed the house work. She learned the trade when she was just a girl and today she is an expert in the field. In the future she is thinking about getting a group of neighbors together to make crocheted clothing for her clients. The loan she requests will be invested in the purchase of threads to keep crocheting. She also wants to invest in her son's education.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

From a very young age she had to dedicate herself to a variety of jobs in order to meet her basic needs because, due to the fact that she was unable to pursue higher education, she has had to use her own wits to get ahead.  Happily, she has done well and she used her savings to set up a small grocery store which she operates out of her own home.  But all is not as easy as it appears.  She works from 6am until 9 or 10pm not risking to stay open any later due to the petty criminals that come out at night.  So far, however, she has been able to succeed.  Lisset hopes to continue doing well in her business because she realizes that it is only through hard work that she will be able to get ahead and reach her goals.  Lisset would like to have a large warehouse in the future where she can sell a great variety of goods thereby increasing her profits allowing her to form a family that she can provide for.  This is her first loan request from PRISMA Microfinancing and she vows to be punctual in her repayments.  With the money she will purchase merchandise such as soft drinks, rice, sugar, candy, etc. to better stock her small store thereby bettering her profits.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":314423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase her inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-08T23:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lisset ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.42,"local_amount":261.2,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":274.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596195},{"amount":83.93,"local_amount":239.8,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":252.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990473},{"amount":15.06,"local_amount":43.02,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":45.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211584},{"amount":74.93,"local_amount":214.1,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":225.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641106},{"amount":59.29,"local_amount":169.4,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":178.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080546},{"amount":25.37,"local_amount":72.48,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:01:51Z","rounded_local_amount":76.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996670}],"funded_date":"2009-05-09T02:21:37Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:01:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":110540,"name":"Gelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gelita L. is from the town of Mohon, Aloran, Misamis Occidental.

To make a living, Virginia owns and operates a general store, selling food and daily use products in the local community.

Virginia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. Virginia is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Virginia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

slowly becoming a reality thanks to the foundation. Before, none of them had their own business but thanks to God and the work that each one of them put in, their dreams are coming true. They decided to call the group Manantial [Spring] because they gather strength like a spring does, they are indigenous people worthy of support and they are as transparent as water. They the Mixtecan language. They wear petticoats and aprons. \r\n\r\nOne of the members is Se\u00f1ora Catalina who is thirty five years old. She has sold napkins and motorcycle parts for a living for the past three years. She is happily married to Se\u00f1or Margarito who is thirty five years old and they have three children - two girls and a boy. The thing she likes most about her business is tiling and embroidery. Do\u00f1a Catalina is a very creative and talented lady. One of her dreams is to have a place to showcase her merchandise so people can appreciate and recognize her work. She requested the loan to buy more colored threads, hoops, sewing hooks, ribbons and needles. \r\n\r\nShe is very grateful for the support that the foundation has given to to her and the people in her group as they want to better themselves and give their families a better life.

He has lived in Baba, Ecuador for over 30 years where he has made a living growing rice. Although his children are all grown up, they all work the fields together in order to make ends meet for the family. On his farm Ramon also raises plantain trees and a few other secondary crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves.

With the loan of 15,000 MT she plans to increase stock. She currently employs one worker, thereby helping to reduce the high local unemployment rate.

Le gusta su trabajo porque le permite interactuar con la gente, haciendo amistad con las personas mayores y los ni\u00f1os, que son los que m\u00e1s consumen estos ricos helados, la parte dif\u00edcil de su trabajo es tener que lidiar con el clima, ya que muchas veces por estas zonas las ma\u00f1anas son nubladas, llueve o graniza, haciendo que la demanda baje.   Estefan\u00eda quiere asegurar su vejez, trabajando ahora que a\u00fan es joven, ya que al no contar con hijos que velen por ella, se preocupa por su futuro.  Con el dinero que solicita comprar\u00e1 mayores insumos, para elaborar sus helados, as\u00ed como cajas de tecnopor, que es donde los mete para venderlos y as\u00ed hacer que en el futuro su negocio sea mucho m\u00e1s productivo y rentable.","en":"Estefan\u00eda is 40 years old.  She is divorced and she lives alone.  She does not have any children.  For the past 9 years she has worked making ice creams in her own business, but she has 20 years of experience, as she began working in an ice cream factory.  Since Estefan\u00eda decided to become independent, in order to sell ice creams, it has gone very well, and she currently gets good profits and sells all that she has.  Usually she sells during the mornings, which is when people eat most of the ice cream, and also in part of the afternoons.  She likes to work because it allows her to interact with people, making friends with adults and children, who eat most of her delicious ice creams.  The difficult part of her business to have to fight the climate.  Often, in her area it is cloudy in the mornings, or it is raining or hailing, which lowers demand. Estefan\u00eda wants to have a secure old age.  She has worked since she was a child, and now since she doesn\u2019t have children of her own to care for her she worries about her future.  With the money that she is asking for she would buy better ingredients in order to improve her ice creams and styrofoam boxes, which is what she puts them in to sell them, so that in the future her business will be more productive and profitable.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jessica Kaminsky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":213678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy ingredients to make and sell ice cream.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-16T06:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estefania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-30T10:38:12Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5336153},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957398},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227648},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-17T07:56:02Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422883},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116107},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":179.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011067}],"funded_date":"2008-10-16T10:38:12Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Kaminsky","image":56671}},{"id":73692,"name":"Chhoeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Chhoeun T., 49, and his wife, Mrs. Sam-ol Chheng, 38, who live in a small village off of national road two about twenty kilometers South of Phnom Penh, were married in 1991 and have three children; two sons and one daughter.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Moevao needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 355 tala or US $148 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Moevao joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Moevao's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Moevao E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.25 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.45 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Jennifer also cooks viands (tasty dishes) so that neighbors who are in the rush and can not find time to cook their own meals can have a good meal from Jennifer's store and get going with their work. Jennifer earns a monthly income of 7,900 Philippines pesos (Php).\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Jennifer is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will use the money to buy more stocks of frozen food and enough ingredients for a daily variety of delicious viands for her customers to choose from. Jennifer desires to be able to put up a restaurant someday, and as stated, her consistency to provide excellent products is the key. She badly needs to maintain a consistently profitable business in order to meet the daily needs of her children.\r\n\r\nAs many small-scale entrepreneurs admit, Jennifer also finds it challenging to deal with customers with long lists of debts. But no challenge, no matter how difficult, can stop her from consistently working with all her strength in order to be able to send her children to school up until college. She envisions have her own house and living in it with a happy, successful family.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He learnt this type of farming from his parents. He will use the Kiva loan to support labor costs during rice production: nursery, transplanting, field management, guarding birds, and, lastly, harvesting activities.\r\n\r\nWith profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

She purchase cottonseed oil at the cotton factory at a wholesale price and resells it on the market in Yavan as well as from home at a higher retail price. She plans to use the obtained credit to increase turnover. Increasing turnover will allow her to increase the profit  obtained from the business. Cottonseed oil is in high demand in rural areas, therefore Nigina's business helps the local population purchase this good at an affordable price. Because the seller purchases the good in the same city and does not need to spend additional money on delivering it to the market, the price remains much lower than if it was delivered from the capital.

Thi Thuy has been a member of the TYM Fund since 2003. She frequently borrowed from the Fund to raise livestock in the earlier years. Currently, besides farming and raising livestock, she and her husband also work as hired workers to increase their income. With the monthly income of 3,000,000VND (about 200USD), not only can she repay the loan weekly and settle daily expenses, but she also can save a small amount to send her children to school and to purchase more household applications, thus improves the standard of living. This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to purchase 6 more pigs to breed, as well as to buy working tools for their job as hired workers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

They live in traditional extended families in the village of Koumantou (in Bougouni prefecture, third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  This group essentially does a variety and diversity of work:  catering, clothing, ... \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members have been partners of Soro Yiriwaso for three years and are on their sixth loan.  According to the president, this partnership is very important because it enables them to have continuous capital for working in income-generating businesses.  The current loan is enough to buy 10 kg of fresh fish each day at 650 francs CFA per kilo, 5 liters of cooking oil, and some firewood.  The fish will be fried and offered for sale.  This commerce allows them to earn 200 francs per kilo of fish sold.  The group members make their sales from a fixed location at the marketplace and door-to-door in the different districts of Koumantou, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed generally of women. \r\n<p>\r\nThe members who sell cloth will buy 10 lengths of Wax brand cloth in Bamako (capital of Mali).  This cloth is cut up into three \"pagnes\" (each typically about 1 meter by 3 meters in size) which are then sold.  Damask fabric is sold by the meter.  The merchants earn 250 francs from each pagne sold and 500 francs from each meter of damask sold. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members can realize an average of 30,000 to 45,000 francs per month.  This is enough to repay the loan and to address certain family expenses.  In the future, the group members want to have their own shops in order to become wholesalers of the fresh fish and cloth that customers demand.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":262157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fish and cloth ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bana   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djoba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":84948.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440354},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:07:56Z","rounded_local_amount":84948.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135732},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":84948.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033533},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":84948.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620901},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":84948.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019866},{"amount":170.85,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":84948.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242624}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T10:43:17Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":90092,"name":"Savoen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Savoen K. is a villager in Boeung village in Kandal province.

Kholjigit has been dedicated to the business of cattle ranching for the last 10 years.

It's also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Amanda invested her very first loan of about $100 in her shop and plans to do the same with this new loan.  Amanda is very friendly to her customers and her business is growing slowly but surely.\r\n\r\nAmanda is grateful to Manuela Ramos for the financial support and business education she receives. Manuela Ramos loan officers give educational sessions about how to grow and promote one's business, as well as other topics, at the monthly meetings of every communal bank.  Additionally, Amanda is pleased that Manuela Ramos requires little paperwork from its borrowers.  To receive a loan, all one need do is be recommended by another responsible borrower, have an ongoing business, and be punctual and responsible in making loan payments.

A Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asin K. R. is a 38 year old man. He leads the Kanaan A Group, which is composed of 8 people in Erbaun Village, East Amarasi Sub district, Kupang District of East Nusa Tenggara Province. Erbaun Village is situated for about 52 Km from Kupang City near to the eastern coast of Timor Island. This village can be categorized as a remote village. The road leading to this village is in bad condition with many holes on it. This makes it difficult for public transportation to enter the village. Only trucks enter, but even they are only available once a week. \r\n\r\nMost of the community in Erbaun village relies on farming to generate income in order to meet their family's needs. But a part of the community, especially those living in coastal area, also try to dig sand to sell as the quality of sand in this village is quite good. This is another way for them to generate money.\r\n\r\nAsin has been living in Erbaun Village since he was a child. Due to his parents' poverty, Asin was only able to have primary education. Consequently, he had to become a farmer because no other jobs were available to him.\r\n\r\nAsin is a married to a 30 year old woman named Elkana. They have been blessed with two children. They are: Mesrin, 6 years old, in the first grade of elementary school, and Vivi, 4 years old and thus not at school yet.\r\n\r\nAsin lives close to the coast. He and family live in a modest house, where the roof is made of palm leaves, the walls are composed of palm branches, the floor is mere dirt and there is no electricity. Asin likes farming better than digging sand as farming is his hobby. He usually sells bananas and coconuts at Inpres market in Kupang City once a week. His wife also helps him in generating money by selling their products. Even though both of them have worked hard to generate money, the income is only enough to meet their daily needs. They cannot save money. Asin and his wife are also challenged by competition in selling their goods.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why Asin is interested in joining a cattle fattening program with the other group members.

His principal work is the buying and selling of cattle. This business requires lots of travel because he needs to go to remote areas where these animals cost less. This requires considerable financial means. The business is very profitable, but his lack of capital makes his income insignificant, and living conditions remain difficult in his household. \r\n<p>\r\nTo strengthen his business, Rahmat is asking for a loan of $1000 USD, which he will use to buy more cattle for expanding his business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, selling general handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Foafoaga has many years of experience in this business.  Foafoaga needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase additional handicrafts to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 130 tala or US $54 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Foafoaga joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Foafoaga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Foafoaga P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.35 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.87 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

Leizel has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month (about $86 US) for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Leizel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business. Leizel is requesting her first loan from ASKI, in the amount of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.
