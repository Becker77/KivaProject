At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRebecca operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos' worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and reselling them by the piece. Aside from this, she also sells processed meat. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 43,000-PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRebecca hopes her business will grow more this coming year, so she'll be able to have their house renovated. She dreams of being able to give her children a high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship* co-members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":880617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-03T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rebecca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":43000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2866.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2866.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2866.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2866.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2866.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2866.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2866.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":466.67,"local_amount":20067,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":20314.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571813},{"amount":266.66,"local_amount":11466,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":11607.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529363},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":11467,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":11608.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738580}],"funded_date":"2011-10-07T03:02:27Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:38:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aya Padr\u00f3n","image":275073}},{"id":344618,"name":"Jacob","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacob is married and blessed with one child.

This is fifty-year-old Zuhura S. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with three children and is also responsible for supporting two other young relatives because they are orphans. Zuhura owns a Mama Lishe or local caf\u00e9 in Dar where she serves up delicious local food. <P>When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. <P>The food is all local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. <P>Josephine, along with one employee, also works as a caterer for local businesses, which has enabled her to increase her monthly profits to US$ 170. She has borrowed and successfully repaid two prior loans from SELFINA for US$ 275 each. This time, she is requesting a larger loan of US$ 525 to purchase additional cooking equipment to help fulfill her catering orders and buy extra cooking supplies on a larger scale. In the future, Zuhura hopes to do well enough to expand her business to another location.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. <P>The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":191808,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional catering and cooking supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-29T19:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zuhura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-12T21:59:18Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53,"local_amount":60571.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":61639,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356191},{"amount":52,"local_amount":59428.57,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":60476,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347933},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970507},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886724},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435984},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:53Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130282},{"amount":52.49,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:07Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027113},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613153},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010236},{"amount":52.51,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232547}],"funded_date":"2008-08-29T21:59:18Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65131,"name":"Halima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Halima is 22 years, and she is married with two children aged 1 and 3 years old.

Currently, thanks to her efforts and her hard work in sales, the store has grown and she sells more products now than she did in the beginning.

To be successful in this business, one has to be committed to wake up way before dawn every day to get the fresh meat from the slaughter house and have it displayed in the market before the first customers arrive.\r\n\r\nBut this is what Mrs. Dolores M. and her husband do each day to provide a good living for themselves and their 3 children. Dolores is 52 years old and a resident of Sitio Kahilwayan, Brgy. Gargato, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. By being her husband's helpmate in the business, she is ensuring that her children will be well provided for and she and her husband will have a nest egg in their old age.\r\n\r\nDolores and her husband are shown in the accompanying picture proudly posing with the chest freezers where they keep meat they do not sell for the day so that it stays fresh and can still be sold the following day.\r\n\r\nDolores joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could have access to additional capital for her business. She has been a good payer, as she has slowly increased her income capacity with each new loan. Now her business nets a monthly income of PHP 14,000, enough to satisfy the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nDolores plans to use her 14th loan, this one for Php 30,000, to expand her business even further and to use as additional working capital for her butcher stand.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the long run she would like to invest in her business to increase her earnings and help her only son.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jordan Shanker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":233220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase construction materials to fortify the front of her home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-12-07T21:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magda Ivania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":76.18,"local_amount":1462.58,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1508.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893575},{"amount":62.69,"local_amount":1203.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:23:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1241.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816683},{"amount":65.91,"local_amount":1265.45,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1304.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351372},{"amount":68.86,"local_amount":1322.15,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1363.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038705},{"amount":13.12,"local_amount":252.02,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":259.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929003},{"amount":95.39,"local_amount":1831.56,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:24:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1888.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383924},{"amount":20.88,"local_amount":400.82,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":413.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890389},{"amount":93.17,"local_amount":1788.92,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1844.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111702},{"amount":60.22,"local_amount":1156.17,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1192.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533127},{"amount":68.58,"local_amount":1316.66,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T10:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1357.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964530}],"funded_date":"2008-12-22T02:50:16Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T10:02:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jordan Shanker","image":null}},{"id":81544,"name":"Vicu\u00f1itas De Tunari Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL GRUPO \"VICU\u00d1ITAS DEL TUNARI \" ESTA REPRESENTADO POR LA SE\u00d1ORA LILIANA ELLA AL IGUAL QUE SUS COMPA\u00d1ERAS TIENE UNA FAMILIA NUMEROSAS COMPUESTA D.

The members are hardworking and responsible people.  In general they are involved in the sale of merchandise such as clothing, handicrafts, vicuna (an animal related to the llama) blankets, sneakers, groceries, auto parts, and home construction.  Within any market there always exists the competition of supply and demand, and these women have learned to deal with it by rotating their merchandise in order to place on sale the items of the season.  Some of them are not able to do it on time and are left with items that are out-of-season and difficult to sell to demanding customers.  It is for this reason that sometimes the members are late with their payments.  The purpose of the loan is to increase merchandise for the Christmas season during which there is a greater demand for their products as well as for the purchase of work tools for the men.  Their experience within the realm of solidarity groups is good since some of the members of this group participated in other loans with other groups and were able to pay punctually.  There exists a family kinship within this group between Marisol and Gonzalo who are brother and sister but they have totally independent incomes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristy

Betty Blando lives in a poor neighborhood in Masaya.  She has worked the past 10 years as a janitor and spends her free time sewing.  Betty previously worked full-time producing beautiful embroidered linens, but she did not earn enough money to cover her monthly fixed expenses.  Therefore, she had to find a better paying full-time job.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe dreams of finishing the construction of her home, situated on the land that her parents provided for her and her family to live.  Betty does not have the money needed to pay for the construction work.  She used her first loan to purchase building materials, such as stone and sand.  Now she is requesting a second loan to buy cement blocks and iron.  This project will provide better living conditions and give her family privacy.

She is well-known and she is not short on patients that hire her. This way she maintains her home and was able to have her children study. With great sacrifice she also bought her land where she is finishing building her house. What she most wants is to finish construction on the second floor to be able to make rooms and rent them to live on their income. Apart from that, she plans to put a business in her same house, a bazaar - bookstore.

She is happily married to the father of their six children; four of whom are adult and live apart, the other two and a granddaughter live with her in a densely populated neighborhood of Lima.\r\n\r\nFor the last three years she has sold costume jewelry at the entrance to the local market.  Initially it was very difficult to set herself up in this area because municipal inspectors would confiscate her merchandise because there are no permits for street vending.  However, her persistence bore fruit and now she does well; besides, she's happy because she can help her husband, who is a police officer, meet household expenses.  At the same time, she is teaching the business to her daughter, who is a single mother, so that she will learn how to work.  In the future, she wants to buy a stand inside the market because it is very profitable and she will be able to provide her children with an adecuate education.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP and she reconfirms her commitment to continue being very punctual with her repayments, as she has been until now.  Also, she comments that she is proud to belong to her group because she has very responsible fellow members. \r\n\r\nShe will use the requested funds to buy hair accessories and similar items.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":496465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy hair accessories and similar items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grethel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":452.05},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":463.92},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":488.69},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":508.24},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":553.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.22},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.37},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.04},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.74},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":158.22,"local_amount":452.05,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":455.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993320},{"amount":162.37,"local_amount":463.92,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":467.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718103},{"amount":171.04,"local_amount":488.69,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":492.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751777},{"amount":177.89,"local_amount":508.24,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:04Z","rounded_local_amount":511.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934240},{"amount":186.74,"local_amount":533.55,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":537.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673014},{"amount":193.74,"local_amount":553.55,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":557.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886811}],"funded_date":"2010-03-12T00:56:22Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":184818,"name":"Achintha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Achintha is a 39-year-old woman living with her husband and 2 children in Kamburugamuwa in the Matara district of southern Sri Lanka.

Catalina, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a sari sari (general) store. Her husband Rodrigo, who is 41 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living. They have three children who are 10 to 21 years old. Susan joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Susan has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the college education of her children and house renovation. Susan is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a sari-sari store, an Avon dealership (beauty products direct seller) and fish vending. Her husband Peter is 60 years old. They have five children who are 17 to 34 years old. Julieta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Julieta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,400, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 to buy merchandise to sell in her sari-sari store and in her other businesses so that she can continue to save up for the future for her kids' schooling and home improvement. Julieta is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

Before that her family's income only came from farming and rearing pigs. After joining the Fund and having more capital, she decided to invest in raising cows to breed and sell. Currently, she has 2 cows to breed and 3 cows to sell. Apart from livestock and farming, her family can also rely on fishing so her family's income is very stable. After 10 years of membership, Mrs. Lap has been one of the members who use their loans effectively. This time, she would like to borrow 18,000,000VND (1,100USD) to continue investing in raising cows. Her monthly income is 4,000,000VND (about 266USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb L\u1eadp tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng t\u1eeb n\u0103m 1998.

C. is 41 years old and is married. He has 2 children whose ages are the following: a daughter who is 18 years old and is studying her first year in dentistry, and a son who is 13 years old and is in his second year of middle school. His wife works in a laboratory. His goal is to increase his production, since this would give him a larger income, which has been beneficial as much to his family as to himself. He hopes to continue to have good health so he can continue with his work. He dreams of educating his children so that they can be successful and be prepared to deal with any situation they might be confronted with. \r\n\r\nEddy works in pork butchering. His business is located in Malpaisillo, at the following address: Four blocks south of the Petronic 4 gas station. He has had this business for 15 years. He began the business by buying pig heads, since his father also worked in pork butchering, and he decided to become independent by establishing his own business, which has provided him with plenty of customers, which motivates him to continue with his business. He needs working capital to buy pork because he has to go to different regions to buy the pigs that are most economically favorable for him. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day,

In her position as treasurer of the communal bank Carmen has a very friendly way of carrying out collections from the members of her group but if any of them do not make their payments she encourages them to be responsible with very serious words, which they listen to carefully. \r\n\r\nThe money she requests will be invested to increase the quantity of fruits she sells.\r\n<br

She is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Faatali owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting taro for sale. Faatali has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 680 WST a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nFaatali joined Kiva partner SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,700 WST from SPBD. This loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. Faatali is now requesting a new loan of 2,450 WST, which will also be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. The loan will be her third from SPBD.  Faatali plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house.\r\n<p>\r\nFaatali was not affected by the tsunami which hit Samoa on 9\/29\/09. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About SPBD<\/b><br>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

He works in his farm or agricultural lot to produce tropical fruits such as bananas and oranges.  His wife helps him with the work of maintaining the fruit plantations. They sell their products from this location.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Teofilo P. Condoria lives in the area of Senda E, in Chimore. It is a fairly remote area from the city and therefore for them it is difficult to access banks in search of loans. It was for this reason that CIDRE took the initiative to open an agency in this area and we discovered that the state in which they work has very difficult conditions because of the tropical climate and the 4-kilometer distance that he has to travel every day from his house to his farm. Because of this Mr. Teofilo will use this loan to buy a motorcycle and be able to dedicate more time to maintaining his farm and therefore with his family. \r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Teofilo tells us that his biggest dream is to continue producing tropical fruits and increasing his crops and to be able to see his children and grandchildren have a better future and that one day he will have a well-established plantation in order to leave them an inheritance that helps them in life.

But it can be a big responsibility, too, especially if you are going to run that big family alone. This is the experience of Aleja F., 46, one of CCT*'s Community Partners in Manila. She is a widow with seven dependents. They used to live in Samar, Visayas few years back, but at present she and her family reside in Tondo, Manila.\r\n\r\nAleja's business is the buying and selling of plastic wares, through which she earns an average earning of Php11, 000 a month. She has done this kind of business for around two years by now. She conducts her daily business at home, with the help of a hired vendor.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting for a Php12,000 loan. She will use this fund to level up her plastic ware business, purchasing more products as she looks for more regular customers. With this, she will also have enough to pay the vendor she hires to sell her products. Indeed, this loan is one big step to help Aleja augment her family's daily needs, as it sustains her business.\r\n\r\nAleja says that the availability of a sales assistant is one major problem in her business. Sometimes, she finds no one available to work for her, which should not happen in any case. Nevertheless, she has big hopes that this problem will be met with a solution. Aleja hopes to save up and own a commercial space for her business. And the biggest dream of all, to see all of her children finish their schooling, because her family, big as it is, is all her heart could contain.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":696877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics

Here Maria A. sells a variety of products retail.  She is currently taking advantage of the fact that this is a great time of year for selling gifts for women as Mothers' Day is approaching.  She has requested a Kiva loan to buy stuffed dolls, clothes and small electrical appliances which she will display in her store.  With these nicely packaged gifts, she intends to attract her customers' attention and awaken their interest in buying and their desire to buy.  This will mean they will buy her products and she will increase her sales.\r\n\r\nMaria started her business less than one year ago, selling school supplies.  She made this purchase with capital provided by her son whose goal was to increase their household income.  Initially, Maria worked in rented premises.  She has grown her business through the great service which she provides to her customers which means she earns every day.  Maria's dream for the future is to expand her business and set up new sales locations.  She will have to wait to do this as she has neither enough working capital nor the infrastructure to do it right now.

history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For this reason, Mariam decided to become a farmer 20 years ago.  She says that \"her father used to be a war veteran and a farmer\".  Mariam grows groundnut, maize and sorghum on her plot of land. As a farmer, however, she faces challenges such as the lack of rain, etc. Mariam is starting her first year with myAgro. She became convinced that she should join after talking to myAgro field representatives. This year, she will be making payments to purchase a myAgro package of OPV (open-pollinated variety) seeds and fertilizers to grow groundnut in order to increase her yield on her 0.0625 hectare plot of land.\r\n\r\nMariam has been growing groundnut for 20 years now for its commercial value (since she sells her crop at the market), and its profitability.

Flora owns a beauty salon which she runs with the assistance of two employees. Flora's salon generates approximately US$ 110 in profits each month.<P>Hair, hair and more hair! This is the place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own. <P> This is Flora\u2019s second loan with SELFINA. She successfully paid back her initial loan of US$ 225, which has allowed her to request a larger amount this time. Flora is requesting a loan of US$ 625 to purchase necessary items such as hair products, wigs, and cosmetics for her salon. \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. <P>The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":191869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional hair products for her beauty salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T00:10:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T07:44:24Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63,"local_amount":70560,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":73269,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356203},{"amount":62,"local_amount":69440,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:39Z","rounded_local_amount":72106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347945},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:03Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970519},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886736},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435996},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:59Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130294},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027125},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613165},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010248},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232559}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T07:44:24Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65179,"name":"Dora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dora O., a 45-year-old a widow with three children, is a very dedicated owner and operator of a grocery shop selling such items as rice, evaporated milk, canned foods, drinks, assorted cooking oil, washing powder, toilet soaps, and candies in Obuasi, where she lives.

Otabek was born in 1978 in Shahrituz district. He is married and responsible for four people, including his wife and three children. Very dynamic, serious, and entrepreneurial, he is proposing to expand his herd and repair his enclosure so as to meet the needs of a rather large clientele from his village and its neighborhood, who buy animals from more than 20 km from his village. With this goal in mind, Otabek is requesting a loan that will serve as business capital. The profit he will make from this business will allow him to improve living conditions for his household and also make some investments. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged its already weak economy. 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable--conditions that have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her business targets female products, which include pants, shirts, underwear, cosmetics, and beauty supplies. Ligia is aware of the financial benefits of repeat customers, and therefore focuses her marketing strategy on obtaining long term clients. This is why her numerous clients look for her even when she\u2019s not around to place new orders. Some of her clients are from her prior business, where she prepared food. Ligia has two children and a husband that works as a plumber.\r\n\r\nLidia took the first step in building her credit in 2004 by starting her business with her first ACCION USA loan of $500. She has invested more than $2,000 in her business with the help of four loans from ACCION USA.

It was hard for her to do both, financially and time-wise, but she figured out how to get ahead and now everything is going well for her.  One of her desires is to dedicate herself to her profession.  Right now, she needs money to be able to get promotional products from the catalog and in this way sell more merchandise.

In 1990, she established her farming business, and by working six days a week and  four hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and repaid two loans from Patan BPW, having used her most recent one to purchase additional farming materials.  In the future, Sani Bahini plans to supply vegetable produce to local store.  She thanks you for your support. <p>\r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis loan is administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Pamela, 23, is single and currently lives with her parents.\n\nShe works making chocolates which she later sells to the people in her area.  She has been working like  this for more than two years.  Thanks to this business she has been able to finish her studies in hotel and tourism management.  In addition to this business, two months ago she began working in a factory, which gives her additional income. \n\nPamela's goal is to set up a juice bar in her home where she also can offer her chocolate products.

Kamol has a minivan with which he provides transportation services. Having attended to this business for eleven years, he has gained much experience. Initially he rented a car but, after making certain savings over time, he bought his own minivan. The business is stable and generates the main, considerable income for Kamol\u2019s family allowing improvement in their living conditions.\r\n\r\nCurrently Kamol\u2019s minivan needs some repairs. That\u2019s why he needs a loan of 8,000 Somoni to purchase the spare parts. Kamol thanks everyone for supporting him and promises to repay the loan with accuracy. The well-being of this family is in your hands.   \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in their own house. Along with her beloved father, she has been working for 30 years growing pineapple, coffee, bananas, and avocados and sells this produce and other jungle fruits in bulk, and in this way speeds up the harvest and sends it to the markets of Lima and Huancayo. What she most likes is to develop both activities, as she is considered to be a woman of much courage. As these activities are profitable, they have enabled her to buy more land to build a house and offer a decent standard of living to her children. For the time being, she will continue with this work with the goal of increasing the sale of fruits  until she can really become a distributor of jungle products. This is her second loan from MFP. She likes working with the savings group because the members are so responsible and punctual  that they are an example to follow. With the loan that she is requesting, she will buy sacks of organic fertilizer and agricultural tools such as machetes, hoes, picks, baskets, and sandpaper. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

Mohon, Brgy. Kawit, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a General Store business. Her common law husband Romeo, who is 49 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. Alicia  joined NWTF- Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF- Project Dungganon, Alicia  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to buy stocks for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her store. Alicia D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Tolibjon is a very responsible and optimistic person. He has three children and a wife to support, so he wants to develop his business. This business consists of cattle-raising in his village because there is a very high demand for milk from villagers, and especially from customers who come from nearby towns. Tolibjon is helped by his children. He is currently faced with many problems because his children are growing and their expenses are growing accordingly. The only way to get out of this difficulty is to succeed in business, so we hope that his capabilities along with services provided by IMON International will help him improve his business.                                   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ravshan lives in Instaravshan, Tajikistan. He has four minor children. His wife helps him in business. He is engaged in the cultivation of agricultural products such as wheat and potatoes and also cattle breeding.

Thanks in advance IMON and KIVA he says!\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
