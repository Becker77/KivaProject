They are in their first loan cycle.  Also, as 'Alfa' means the beginning of something, they gave their group this name.  The group has three members: Ana Carina, Edgar and Amelia.  Each of them has requested their loan for different purposes.  Edgar is the group's representative and he will invest his loan in buying a copier, three consumables and paper for printing different sizes such as letter and legal.  He tells us that he is 27 years old and has been married to Amelia for 7 years.  The couple have two children: one is 12 years old and in middle school, and their youngest is 6 years old and in elementary school.\r\n\r\nEdgar started his business (an Internet cafe) as his children's school expenses are very high.  He has had this business for three years.  He didn't have a stable place for his business but one year ago he finally managed to set up his premises.  His Internet cafe still doesn't have a name and he will continue looking for one.  Up to now, he hasn't had any problems with his business, only when his profits fall which usually happens during the holiday period.  However, he is now getting used to this.  He says that it is normal and therefore it doesn't worry him.  One of Edgar's goals is to be able to lower his prices so that he can attract more customers.\r\n\r\nAmelia requested her loan to buy a printer and toner for her business which is also an Internet cafe.  Ana Carina has requested her loan to buy Fuller-brand cosmetics such as creams, perfumes, etc.  In general, the group is very happy and they are grateful to FRAC for their sincere understanding in supporting them and giving them this loan which they need so badly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":862426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a copier, consumables and printing paper","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-09-20T00:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Carina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edgar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1265.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1295.48},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1325.97},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1389.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1421.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1455.27},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1489.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.68},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.05},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.1},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.76},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":309.2,"local_amount":3887.14,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3997.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807742},{"amount":218.46,"local_amount":2746.29,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2823.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618842},{"amount":228.86,"local_amount":2877.08,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2958.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573082},{"amount":118.48,"local_amount":1489.49,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1531.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784792}],"funded_date":"2011-09-21T15:33:04Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":340984,"name":"Mama Umoja Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Penina is the facilitator of the Mama Umoja group.

His best-selling products are painkillers, anti-malaria and family planning drugs, allergy medications, ulcer, worms and skin infection treatment, and various syrups for children suffering from malaria and upper respiratory infections. His vast knowledge and experience, as well as the positive attitude and kindness, have earned him a good reputation within his community.

life and in future be able to send his dearest little daughter to school. Farming has been his major source of income. Alimardon produces rice once a year. In spite of the expensive farm inputs, merchants buy their rice at a lower price. Because of this, Alimardon is requesting a loan of 700 USD to support his farming business and to avoid asking for credits from merchants who charge higher interest. <P>\r\n\r\nAlimardon is grateful that he is able to borrow from lenders that offer small interest and create better opportunities in their lives - thus helping their family to be free from poverty. Alimardon said that through prayers and hard work, his dreams can be achieved someday. Providing his daughter with education is one of the important things that Alimardon prioritizes.  <P>\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She needs a loan to buy thread, scissors, buttons, higher quality fabrics, zippers, embroidery items, as capital investment to get her business off the ground. \nEach woman in the committee devotes herself to her independent activities, while working with the other members to cooperate and lead their group in the correct direction to achieve their shared goals. \n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":433205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Coronel Oviedo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.416667 -56.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrocinia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tereza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zoraida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ciria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicolaza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ciria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":5400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":450000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":160057,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is 40 years old and married with two school-aged daughters.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

I have been in a common law relationship for the last 10 years.  Recently we finished building our own house since we had previously been living in my parent's home.  The four children that I have go to elementary school and there are many expenses because the teachers constantly ask for things that the children need to bring to school.  I make a living by raising sheep.  I am asking for the loan to be able to buy sheep and be able to raise them.  Taking care of the animals is simple for me because I have a corral and I leave them there and only take food and water for them to eat and drink.

He is single, 49 years old, and studied until fifth grade.  He had to stop school because of a lack of transportation, since the school was very far from his house.  He is the father of 12 children, whose ages range from five to 25 years old.  The oldest is already married and the rest go to school.\r\n\r\nJequicene left Inhambane for Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, looking for work.  He began by working as a guard for Franciscan sisters for 12 years.  But because of the rising cost of living, and because he wasn't earning much, he began a business selling earthenware pots and gave up his job to concentrate on more lucrative businesses.  With his business earnings, he managed to build two houses, since he had two wives, and also bought a vehicle to help him with his work.  Now, in addition to selling earthenware pots, he provides informal public transportation services and has a daily income of 200 mtn.  He also raises chickens.  This occupation he learned with the Franciscan sisters (where he would spend 12,000 mtn to raise 200 chicks).\r\n\r\nThis poultry business earns an income of 5,000 mt in every cycle, and it is growing with the loan he had from Hluvuku-Kiva.  These days, raising 500 chicks costs 30,000 MT in each phase, and therefore has a profit of 12,000MT.  And he manages to pay family expenses (caring for his parents who live with him in his house) and his children's studies.  Each month he is able to save 3,000 MT.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan for Jequicene with Hluvuku and Kiva.  The first 18,000 MT were used to grow his chicken raising business.  He managed to repay it with no problem, and asks for this second loan of 22,000 MT to enlarge the size of his stock.  He is confident that he will repay it ahead of time and and ask for a new loan to grow his business, each time a little more.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Heidi Petersen, Kiva

She is married to Rogelio J., a driver, and is the mother of two children, both of whom are studying. The elder child is in high school while the other is enrolled in elementary. By the grace of God, Norma has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send both of them all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Norma as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nNorma maintains a variety store and a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, frozen cuts of meat and other products mostly through the popular direct selling brand, Avon, and a popular local meat brand.  A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s cost price is lower than the price in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers earn as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day from her variety store and direct selling business.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nNorma dreams of being able to give both her children a good, high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":617969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy orders for her customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T10:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4343.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380507},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3619.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816841},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2895.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652784}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T12:18:20Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":242650,"name":"Gred","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gred es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\u201d  ubicado en el distrito Juliaca, provincia San Rom\u00e1n y departamento de Puno, tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad, de estado civil soltera y no tiene  hijos, la se\u00f1orita continua con sus estudios de educaci\u00f3n superior.\n\nGred viene trabajando con el Movimiento Manuela Ramos desde hace un a\u00f1o, el primer pr\u00e9stamo fue de S\/. 350.00 nuevos soles, dinero que le sirvi\u00f3 para  incrementar el capital de  su negocio venta de salchimote.\n\nLa se\u00f1orita solicitar\u00e1 un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo de  S\/. 700.00 nuevos soles, dinero que le servir\u00e1 para comprar ma\u00edz, pollo y otros insumos m\u00e1s para su negocio de venta de salchimote.\n\t\nSu sue\u00f1o es tener un capital propio, tener trabajo y no tener deudas.\n\nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su Banco Comunal es la puntualidad y el apoyo mutuo.\n","en":"Gred is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\u201d (Heart of Jesus) which is located in the District of Juliaca, San Rom\u00e1n Province, Department of Puno.

This area always lacks bus services. \r\n\r\n<p>Erdeneselenge is planning to buy a plot of land upon which to build a family house later on. She has started negotiations and she needs to pay the money for the land. She and her husband are going to use their savings to pay for the land, but still need some additional money. Erdeneselenge is requesting a loan to be used as the remaining payment for the land plot.

Starting with the sum of 13,500 som (KGS) Kulsara has been able to expand her herd, which now has four cows and two calves and yields a profit of 7,000 som monthly. An additional source of income this year will also be a three acre plot of potatoes of land which Kulsara is planning to sell in May\/July of next year. To further develop her livestock business, Kulsara has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to purchase four more calves for fattening and sale.

She has been in this line of work for approximately 10 years.  Flor enjoys this job because it has enabled her to have an income for taking care of the household expenses and providing an adequate education for her children.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

In addition to selling food in her house, she also delivers orders to those who need them.  In this way, she stays busy all day.  Nevertheless, she is looking for a way to construct a restaurant where she can receive more clients and have the opportunity to give her youngest son a college education.

B. is retired and lives in Vahdat.  He has six children, and his oldest child is now working in Russia.  However, the family still needs money, so Abdujabor raises livestock as a business.  He purchases calves at low prices and sells them on for a small profit.  Since the earnings from his business are not large, Abdujabor has applied for a loan in order to buy another pair of calves.  This will help him increase his sales volume.  In addition, the calves that he sells provide fresh meat for the local population.

She lives in her mother\u2019s house with her younger sister. She has sold essential products, in addition to sweets and drinks, for 5 years inside her house. She likes being able to give a good deal to her clients and to see her business grow day to day. The business is very profitable because it is located in a busy area. The difficult thing for her is that there are often small robberies by inconsiderate people. They enter her business, and, when she\u2019s not looking, they take products in secret. This is her seventh loan with MFP. With the money that she is requesting, she wants to build bars to protect her business. She also wants to supply more products to her business and, later, to have a mini-market. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":224180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase her merchandise and to build bars for protection","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-23T18:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":223.25},{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":236.25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.71},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":253.37},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":267.13},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":274.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":74.42},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":78.75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84.46},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":89.04},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":74.42,"local_amount":223.25,"processed_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":230.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5336184},{"amount":78.75,"local_amount":236.25,"processed_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":243.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957599},{"amount":81.9,"local_amount":245.71,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":253.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227857},{"amount":84.46,"local_amount":253.37,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":261.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423089},{"amount":89.04,"local_amount":267.13,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":275.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116325},{"amount":91.43,"local_amount":274.29,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":282.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011273}],"funded_date":"2008-11-23T20:58:37Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":77932,"name":"Ramiro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Ramiro I. trabaja desde hace 5 a\u00f1os en el rubro llantero, dedicandos\u00e9 al inflado parchado y colocado de llantas pinchadas y desinfladas, trabajo que realiza laboriosamente desde muy tempranas horas de la ma\u00f1ana, hasta altas horas de la noche, atendiendo principalmente a transportistas p\u00fablicos, debido a que su negocio se encuentra en la ruta de varias l\u00edneas de buses.

She is a widow and has an adult son. Valieva has a successful flour-selling business at the local market in the town of Isfara, where she sells an assortment of high-quality sorts of flour. Because she buys the flour wholesale, her prices are cheaper than those of her competitors. For this reason, she has many customers who buy her flour straight from her house. Today, there is a great demand for her goods, which is why she wants to take an individual loan. She has requested a loan of $800 to add to her working capital and allow her to purchase more goods. She promises to repay the loan within nine months. Valieva is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices, and push every once in a while to achieve her goals and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe her perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in her small business.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale. Selina has 2 years of experience in this business. Selina needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 talas or US $42 per week) to pay her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Selina joined SPBD. This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Selina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

","en":"The following group is located in the community of Yondes\u00e9 del Cerdero, San Jos\u00e9 del Rinc\u00f3n.  It is a community of very limited economic resources.  The community has been paved through a little bit of work which was carried out by the town authorities but before it was just dust and loose sand.  The houses are mainly made of adobe and many are also made from wood.  The people do not know how to read, except the children who attend school. Most of the community is still just sand as the only bit that was paved was the main road.  The people are very simple, humble, kind and polite.  They haven't lost the good manners that they had in the past.\r\n\r\nThe 'Los Ositos' (Little Bears) group has 8 members: 7 women and 1 man.  All of the members are neighbors and friends.  The main business activity carried out in this community is raising livestock (pigs, sheep, cows and poultry).  The mode of transportation continues being horses.  Although the truck does pass through it isn't very frequent.\r\n\r\nThe names of the members of this group are as follows:\r\n1.-Herminia C. U. - 39 years old\r\n2.-Antonia C. C. - 58 years old\r\n3.-Consuelo P. U. - 58 years old\r\n4.- Catalina U. C. - 51 years old\r\n5.-Sandra Garc\u00eda H. - 28 years old\r\n6.-Rocio S. R. - 32 years old\r\n7.-Leonardo C. C. - 33 years old\r\n8.-Ana Maria F. C. - 35 years old\r\n\r\nThe members of this group gave themselves the name 'Los Ositos' (Little Bears) because they didn't know what name to give their group and the names they chose were already taken by other groups.   One of the member's daughters would bring with her a teddy bear that she would cuddle and so they gave their group this name.\r\n\r\nThe group's representative is Rocio.  Rocio tells us that the members of her group have known each other for years and they have worked together before.  She tells us that they are all trustworthy and hard-working people.  They need financial help to get ahead in life.  All the members of her group raise livestock which they fatten and then sell.  Her business is buying and selling lambs.  She also has a small store in her home where she sells soft drinks and also some candy and cookies.  She raises turkeys and horses.  She has a little of everything which helps her to cover her household expenses.\r\n\r\nRocio tells us that it is becoming hard to feed her animals because the pasture will be finished soon and they have to buy.  She tells us that the loans help her a lot because she can buy the animals she wants for cash and this makes her more profit because she can acquire them more cheaply.  She raises the animals and fattens them herself.    Rocio is married and has been living with her husband in their own home for 15 years.  She has 4 children.  Two of her children are in school and the other two are still too young for school.  Rocio's husband works in Mexico City because he couldn't find work near home.  He comes home to visit his family every week or fortnight."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3025,"image":{"id":704863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To invest in lambs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-02-08T15:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3025,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herminia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Consuelo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.12},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.12},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":378.13,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4531.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850149},{"amount":1134.37,"local_amount":13500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":13595.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292423},{"amount":756.25,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":9063.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160681},{"amount":756.25,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:24Z","rounded_local_amount":9063.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233555}],"funded_date":"2011-02-10T20:34:16Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":275444,"name":"Morn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Morn S., 34, is married and lives with her husband and a child in Kampong Chnang province, Cambodia \u2013 an area known for palm products.

This is known as a cattle-raising and cheese-making region. Here there is a group named after the community, since its members believe the name will help their group become better known. They have 10 members.\r\n\r\nNorberto is a member of the group. He is 38 years old, studied through secondary school, and is now married with 2 children, both attending a community primary school. Norberto tells us that when he was very small, his parents had a store called Abarrotes Ramos, and a little over 10 years ago, his parents left the store to him. Now he and his wife run it. The store is located in his house and one parallel to his.\r\n\r\nNorberto prefers keeping the store well-stocked so that his customers can always find what they are looking for. He needs this loan to buy beans, rice, flour, oil, sugar, salt, soup, soap, clorox, detergents, cookies, soft drinks, sweets, toilet paper, canned goods (chili, beans, tuna), tomatoes, chilis, onions, and bread, to restock his store.\r\n\r\nNorberto hopes that with this investment, his business will prosper, since he wants his store to grow. His earnings will be used to paint the store and to offer a better quality of life to his children.\r\n\r\nThe remaining members of the group are:\r\nEsther - Sells tacos\r\nFrancisca - Sells soft drinks\r\nCarmela - Sells soft drinks\r\nManuela - Sells groceries\r\nRaquel - Sells shoes\r\nGerardo - Rents out a tractor\r\nMagdalena - Sells dishes and utensils\r\nGabriela - Sells Mexican snacks\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":802284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"sell groceries, shoes, soft drinks, snacks and dishes and utensils.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"La Candelaria, Tuxtepec, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-06-30T16:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3700,"lender_count":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":44000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1387.5,"local_amount":16500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:48Z","rounded_local_amount":16558.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223457},{"amount":693.75,"local_amount":8250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":8279.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201734},{"amount":1280.42,"local_amount":15226.58,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":15280.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807324},{"amount":338.33,"local_amount":4023.42,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4037.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618446}],"funded_date":"2011-07-07T04:56:42Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":316425,"name":"Sokong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokong is a factory worker.

She\u2019s been living with her spouse for almost two years in a humble house that\u2019s hers, though.

On the other hand, her husband earns extra income working as a day worker on other fields but he doesn\u2019t do this too frequently.\r\n\r\nIrma is starting the farming chores.  Her family is still young so she\u2019s always had inconveniences because of that like the lack of budget, for example, and lack of personnel and land.

Calzada is approximately 3800 meters (12,500 ft) above sea level, a community economically based on raising livestock (cattle, sheep), agriculture (barley, wheat, oats, potatoes) and in some cases traD. activities in the fairs in the district capitals (Acobamba and Paucar\u00e1). The population is sparse and it usually takes five minutes to get from house to house.\r\n<p>\r\nVillage bank member Julia A. S. has a loan of 1000 Peruvian Nuevo Soles ($355 USD) and according to her testimony she says: \"I have a business to buy and sell livestock and I bring them to the Acobamba and Paucar\u00e1 fairs and in order to sell I need to leave at two in the morning and reach the fairs. In a few years I hope to have enough animals in order to raise and sell them when I need to. Furthermore I have a grandchild that is with me and studies at Puca Cruz. In the future I hope that he studies to become a professional after he finishes high school. In FINCA Per\u00fa I am saving for the future of my grandchild because he is the only one by my siD.. Also I want to increase my livestock. Now that I am with FINCA Per\u00fa, I have learned to save and work with more confidence, more responsibility and also to attend the training sessions.\"\r\n<p>\r\nGuillerma P. P. is working with a loan of 600 Peruvian Nuevo Soles ($213 USD) and says the following: \" I have a business to buy and sell livestock, principally sheep and at times cattle. When I see that an animal is fat I am able to sell it in the fair. My dream is to have much more livestock, to be able to raise and sell more of them in the future. I am going to save for my children\u00b4s education. Now that I have joined FINCA Per\u00fa I am going to learn how to save, because I have neighbors and relatives that have joined FINCA Per\u00fa and they tell me it is very nice to belong to a village bank. I will listen to the organization\u00b4s training, share with the other clients, work with more responsibility and acquire some items that we need. I will receive training that FINCA has promised and I am going to learn many valuable things that I want for my family and

During the rainy season, she cultivates rice while growing vegetables in the dry season.  Her husband, Mr. Kem Touch, is a cow middleman who buys cows and re-sells them later at a better price.  Since this business is going well, he wants to expand it, so his wife, Mrs. Duch C., decided to ask for a loan to buy more calves for breeding in order to re-sell.  Mrs. Duch C. has five children, three of whom are employed in a garment factory, while the remaining two are attending school. \r\n\r\nThis village bank loan is an end-of-term loan and all the members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.  End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor.  It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.  Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term.  Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

She is a widow and has given birth to nine children. Currently, four of them attend school. She lives together with some of her children in the family house in a town called Nkwaateng, a farming community in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Hawa lost her husband after a short ailment. \r\n<p>\r\nShe works zealously as a single parent to support her family and provide for the children\u2019s schooling. She is a fishmonger and also sells used clothes. She sells her wares out of a shed in the local market square. She procures her goods from larger fishmongers who sell at wholesale prices in the towns of Yeji and Mankessim. Hawa has been in business for ten years.

She now needs 1500 new soles to buy regional cereals like: chu\u00f1o (freeze-dried potato), potato, barley, etc.  Her wish for the future is to have a house in Tacna in which to live happily with her family.  What she likes most about her communal bank is the savings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":437413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy freeze-dried potato, potato, barley, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petrona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1506.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954256}],"funded_date":"2010-01-02T04:51:34Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":164238,"name":"Emilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emilia is forty-five-years-old.

Anahaw, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a rice retailing  business. Her husband, Raul B., who is 51 years old, works as a driver to earn his living. He also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 6 and 26 years old. Ruth joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past fourteen loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ruth has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5600, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifteenth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13000, which she intends to use for additional capital for her rice retailing so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Ruth is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two businesses: one a passenger transport (by motorized tricycle) and the other a general store. Her husband Felixardo, who is 32 years old, drives the tricycle to earn his living. They have four children who are 1 to 7 years old. \r\n\r\nMarilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly income of 8,400 PHP, bettering the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her third loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use as down payment for another motorcycle so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of business and the education of her children. \r\n\r\nMarilyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

V. is going to buy wood, clay, and glaze to make pots and jars for the Day of the Dead. \r\n\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda Myriam Guzm\u00e1n C. is going to buy bags of sugar, boxed oil, sweets and boxed juices to stock her business selling cakes, picaditas and dobladitas (various traditional fast food items).\r\n\r\nMs. Irene C. Arriza is going to buy pots and pans to stock her business. She is going to buy glaze, wood, paint, and clay to manufacture large and small pots and pans. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Myriam is a member of the group. She is 22 years old and she has her high school diploma. She is married and does not have any children. She has a business selling food in the telesecundaria (a distance school program for secondary and high school students). She is requesting a loan to buy oil, rice, sugar, sweets, soft drinks, vegetables, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and cream. She is also going to fix her bathroom and construct it using brick rather than bamboo. Her customers are students, teachers, parents and she offers them tacos, tostadas, quesadillas, tortas, sweets and soft drinks. She started her business 3 years ago out of necessity and learned by watching others prepare. Her mother taught her to prepare food, and the parent committee at the school told her that since there wasn't anyone to sell food at school if she wanted to do so she could and she liked the idea. Her father-in-law lent her the money to start sales. She walks to work, carrying her goods in a wheelbarrow. Her business is important and special to her because she eats there. What she likes most about her job is when she sells, when the boys buy her foods and do not walk away. The greatest challenge she faces is the weather, when it rains, or when the boys do not bring money because sales decrease. Her competition is a lady who sells the same products in the school. She uses her business profits to go shopping in the center every eight days for food supplies, to stock her food supply, repay the loan, and to pay her dues from selling to the telesecundaria. Her husband helps with overall food sales and he knows how to do everything. \r\n\r\nSan Marcos is a nice place to breathe fresh air. They celebrate the patron saint of San Marcos on April 25. There are masses, procession, dances, carnival rides, Brinco de Chinelos (traditional indigenous dance from the state of Morelos), the planting of corn and sorghum, and almost all do pottery work. \r\n\r\nThis business has helped in feeding their family. The plans and hopes are to continue with the business selling food to make earnings to buy a car to use to go and buy the merchandise and to travel from their house to the school with their food. \r\n\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda Miriam is happy with this loan because she is able to continue growing her business. The members of the this group want to tell Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Thank you for the support and the trust you give us, thanks to these loans we can get ahead in our business and our families\".\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":705465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase packages of sugar, boxed oil, rice, sweets, juices, soft drinks, vegetables, green and red tomatoes, chiles, cheese, cream","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Barrio San Pedro, Acteopan, Estado de Puebla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-02-09T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorgina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Myriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":240.63,"local_amount":2875,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850155},{"amount":721.87,"local_amount":8625,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:11:00Z","rounded_local_amount":8651.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292429},{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5767.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160687},{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5767.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233561}],"funded_date":"2011-02-12T21:39:42Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dina Bach","image":962950}},{"id":275460,"name":"Myanzi Mixed Group-Mityana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thirty-year-old Roset N. is happily married with three kids.

Owing to the increase in the price of corn, she needs capital so that she can buy in larger quantities and save.  According to her customers' needs, she also sells corn which makes her an additional income to that which she makes selling her tortillas.  Both ladies would like to continue working and expanding their businesses.  They are happy to have this opportunity to obtain capital with which they can achieve their goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":802418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy essential household products and to buy corn wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Aldea Cruz Blanca San Juan Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Marta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":5200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":577.84},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":577.77},{"due_date":"2011-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":577.77},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":577.77},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":577.77},{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":577.77},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":577.77},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":577.77},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":577.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225.33,"local_amount":1735.9,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-20T07:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1760.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227659301},{"amount":75.02,"local_amount":577.92,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":586.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232785246},{"amount":75.01,"local_amount":577.82,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":586.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589624},{"amount":75.01,"local_amount":577.83,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":586.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244547686},{"amount":75.78,"local_amount":583.81,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":592.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250758272},{"amount":148.85,"local_amount":1146.72,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-21T08:50:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1162.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":258112850}],"funded_date":"2011-08-02T15:51:37Z","paid_date":"2012-02-21T08:50:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":316441,"name":"Lunh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lunh is a palm sugar seller.

Those who find pleasure in a life where they have to live by their wits are many but given a choice, they would go with something that helps them to bring value and mileage to their lives. \r\n\r\nTwelve years ago is when 38-year-old mother of four,  Prossy, made the decision to take root in her fish sales business in Jinja. Jinja is the source of the Nile River and many indigenous people have taken to fishing and fish selling as their source of livelihood. \r\n\r\nProssy joined the fish sales business with no prior business experience but under the financial auspices of her husband. She has sustained her business through thick and thin with grit, tenacity and unwavering diligence.

She is known as a very industrious and generous woman in her community, so her business grows accordingly. As she stated \"A man who is productive and hard working will become prosperous \".

She does agricultural work and also makes embroidered slips (underskirts), which she learned to make as a child.  She works everyday without fail, taking care of her farmland and raising livestock (cattle and sheep) in her stables.  \r\n\r\nGladys is a great help to her parents and supports most of the household.  She wishes to keep improving the infrastructure of her stables and increasing the number of animals that she has.  This is her second loan with MFP; she is very happy to belong to a community bank because it allows her to improve the quality of her life while also helping other members improve their quality of life.  The money that she is requesting will be used to buy sacks of fertilizer for this sowing season.  She will also buy supplies and materials (cloth and thread) for her embroidery.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva

Several years ago Pedro decided to start his own business, owing to the neeed to have a stream of revenue, since he didn't have a job. In the face of this difficult situation he decided not to cross his arms and do nothing and began buying some grocery items to sell at his home.

business. She lives in Sitio Suol, Barangay Nanunga, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her food vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10000. Aida is now borrowing PHP 18000 so that she could continue to fund the operations of her food products. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 18000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Aida aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

junto a su esposo Luis de 40 a\u00f1os y sus 2 queridos hijos Enrique de 15 y Salome de 2 a\u00f1os, a quienes desea brindar una mejor calidad de vida. En el puesto de comida de Rosa lo que menos le faltan son clientes, ya que est\u00e1 ubicado cerca de los aserraderos de Pucallpa. Sus principales comensales son aquellas personas que trabajan en el aserradero, que luego de una larga ma\u00f1ana de trabajo, no dudan en comer los deliciosos platos que ella prepara. Los precios que ofrece a sus clientes, son muy accesibles y este es el principal gancho de su puesto de comida. Lleva 5 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y lo que m\u00e1s le gusta es cocinar y saber que sus clientes reconozcan su trabajo; sin embargo ella sola no se da abasto y a veces a tendido dificultad para atender a todos sus clientes. Su mayor anhelo es que su negocio se desarrolle, pero para ello debe trabajar muy duro para conseguirlo, por tal raz\u00f3n espera que ustedes la ayuden con un peque\u00f1o pr\u00e9stamo. Este es el segundo cr\u00e9dito con MFP y al igual como hizo con sus primeros cr\u00e9ditos, esta dispuesta a pagar todas sus cuotas a tiempo. En su banco comunal es una socia muy querida y respetada por la responsabilidad que demuestra. Con los ochocientos nuevos soles solicitados, comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s sillas y mesas para mejorar la atenci\u00f3n en su puesto de comida.\n\n","en":"Rosa is 33 years old.  She is a kind and hard-working woman who lives in her own home together with her husband, 40 year-old Luis, and her two beloved children - 15 year-old Enrique and 2 year-old Salome - who she would like to provide with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nWhat Rosa's food stall least lacks is customers since it is located near the Pucallpa sawmills.  Her main diners are the people who work in the sawmills.  After a long morning's work, they don't hesitate to come and eat the delicious meals that Rosa prepares.  The prices that she offers are very affordable and this is the main 'bait' that she uses on her food stall to attract customers.\r\n\r\nRosa has been in this business for five years and what she most enjoys about her work is cooking and knowing that her customers are appreciative of her work.  However, Rosa finds it hard to manage alone and sometimes she has found it difficult to serve all her customers.  Her greatest wish is to develop her business.  In order to achieve this, she must work very hard.  For this reason, she hopes that you will help her with a small loan.\r\n\r\nThis is Rosa's second loan from MFP and, as was the case with her first loan, she is ready to make all her repayments on time.  She is a very well-liked member of her community bank who is respected for the responsibility that she displays.  Rosa will use the 800 Peruvian soles that she has requested to buy more tables and chairs in order to improve her service."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":782745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables and chairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-05T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":119.19},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":126.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":129.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":136.36},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":141.82},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":146.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.7},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.3},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.14},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.18},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.7,"local_amount":119.19,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":123.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550446},{"amount":47.3,"local_amount":126.13,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":130.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719122},{"amount":208,"local_amount":554.68,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":575.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350586}],"funded_date":"2011-06-06T17:25:40Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":308262,"name":"Esperanza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Esperanza tiene ya m\u00e1s de tres a\u00f1os dedic\u00e1ndose a la venta de ropa usada en diferentes partes de la ciudad.\n  Esta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo ya que le est\u00e1 haciendo falta mas variedad de mercanc\u00eda como es ropa para hombre, ni\u00f1os, accesoria para bebe y quiere tambi\u00e9n vender aparatos electr\u00f3nicos. \nDo\u00f1a Esperanza espera contar con su cooperaci\u00f3n en este cr\u00e9dito ya que para ella es muy importante, porque es la fuente de ingreso para su familia. \nDesea mejorar su negocio y que sus clientes puedan encontrar sus necesidades de vestir con ella. \n","en":"Se\u00f1ora Esperanza has been selling used clothing in various parts of the city for more than three years .

He owns a 0.3-acre piece of land that is home to his family. With the support of his wife, Stephen does mixed farming. The income he makes from selling milk, eggs, and tea produced at the farm enables him to provide a decent living for his family of 2 children.He also does some side hustle business(motorbike business).He also uses the income from farming to pay for his children's education. Stephen is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow to add to the two cows he already owns. Dairy farming is a good, sustainable source of income for farmers like Stephen. As time goes by, children grow, and family expenses also soar. The only way a farmer such as Stephen can cope with this change is by scaling the business to earn more income. The additional cow will produce more milk for sale and increase the family's income. With more income, Stephen will be able to meet the increasing demands of his family and grow his asset base. Some of the profits from this investment will be ploughed back into the business to facilitate its growth.  Stephen needs a bit of help, and it can be you who collaborates with him, with just one loan.\nBe inspired during this festive season and make a loan!\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2050248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":41600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2944.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3030.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3118.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3209.9},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.71},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3400.26},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3499.63},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3601.91},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3707.17},{"due_date":"2016-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3815.51},{"due_date":"2016-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3927.03},{"due_date":"2016-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4041.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.86},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.79},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.74},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.75},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":108,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick has nine children plus his wife.
