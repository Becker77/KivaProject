The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":223074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of an irrigation machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-18T21:20:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sponsa  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:12:04Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970739},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886956},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436216},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130489},{"amount":27.77,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027288},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613311},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010394},{"amount":27.79,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232705},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664521}],"funded_date":"2008-11-18T23:05:19Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aiga Stokenberga","image":390110}},{"id":77592,"name":"Tawofic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tawofic is 45 years old and married with four children.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase rice, cooking oil, biscuits, and vouchers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-11T17:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kawiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027599},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613600},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010679},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:13Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232965},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664756},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105475},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022620},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867869},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757070},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146182}],"funded_date":"2009-03-11T22:35:17Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Naegeli","image":264373}},{"id":98072,"name":"Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Margarita Jir\u00f3n tiene 79 a\u00f1os de edad, su estado civil es soltera.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

In addition to his shop operation, he also offers his beauty services upon request to the clients at their homes. He always tries to be up to date in this market and offers the new hair designs to his customers. Today, he is requesting to borrow $1,200 from the Kiva partner, Ameen s.a.l., to purchase new hairdressing tools for his work. In the future, he would like to expand his client base and he hopes to open a bigger beauty salon.  \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been withheld to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support of Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen: \r\n\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in Lebanese Micro-finance since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specializing in Micro-finance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement to their micro-loan borrowers.

The group has 10 members, all women, who work in various activities, including: animal husbandry, pants-making, making traditional skirts, and selling food and typical clothing.

They live together in Triboline, located on the edge of the Peruvian jungle, where they have their own house. Teodosia indicates that her grocery business has become a large business over the last few years, and for that reason she's very dedicated to this work. In the beginning, she worked in farming, but she needed a larger income, so she decided to start a new business. Twenty-six years have passed, and today she has customers that always come to her store, and for that reason she is always attending to customers while her husband, with the help of a laborer, takes care of their fields. Her work begins at 5:30am and goes until 9:00pm, and her plan for the future is to continue expanding her store, in order to carry more products and meet her customers' needs. This is her fourth loan through MFP, and she agrees to continue following her payment plan. She is also very happy with her communal bank, as they all support each other. With the funds she is requesting, she plans to invest in purchasing products, in order to stock her store with groceries and avoid mishaps with her customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":606555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a variety of products to stock her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodosia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2517.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549440}],"funded_date":"2010-10-11T17:24:45Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kristen Jancuk","image":703031}},{"id":238220,"name":"Lanaya Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les Cinq membres du groupe LANAYA sont toutes des  femmes mari\u00e9es  avec une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 35 ans, et ont en moyenne  3 enfants.

She has dedicated herself to agriculture and farming since her childhood. Her parents taught her both businesses and today it has become her primary source of income. The extensive farm land that she owns was inherited by her parents. She cultivates corn and potatoes and other products. She anxiously waits several months for the harvest because she knows that the sale of these products will help her to recover her investment and to earn a profit.  She also raises sheep, donkeys, and cows. They are considered as working capital and in various occasions it has helped her out of some financial difficulties. Additionally she is also an artisan who knits items that are sold at markets in the city. This generates an extra income for her family. But her greatest priority is to increase her working capital with the purchase of a good breed of livestock, which is more profitable. This is her third loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). She considers that being part of her communal bank is a positive experience because it helps her grow as a person and above all it helps her adequately distribute her loan.

D. Thi Nga is 44 years old, and joined TYM fund in 2006. She currently lives in a village that has a tradition of making baskets. Luckily both she and her husband are very skilled in making baskets. When first joining the fund, she borrowed 185.00 USD to buy materials for making baskets. In this business, they are able to use the labor of everyone in the family. Because of their skillfulness and years of experience in this trade, customers always place their orders ahead and thus her family did not have to spend time trying to sell the baskets. Their daily income from making the baskets is 9.00 USD. Her son works outside the home and makes about 92.00 USD per month. For this loan, her family wishes to borrow 550.00 USD to continue investment in their basket- making business. Their average monthly income is 305.00 USD.\r\n<b><p>Translated from Vietnamese by Thu Ostrander, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nTham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2006, ch\u1ecb \u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb Nga 44 tu\u1ed5i hi\u1ec7n \u0111ang sinh s\u1ed1ng \u1edf l\u00e0ng ngh\u1ec1 truy\u1ec1n th\u1ed1ng l\u00e0 l\u00e0m th\u00fang.

Es una se\u00f1ora muy encantadora y simp\u00e1tica, le gusta mucho conversar con la gente. Ella vive en uni\u00f3n libre con su pareja; ella ten\u00eda dos hijos, pero lamentablemente su hija falleci\u00f3 entonces solamente tiene un hijo de 16 a\u00f1os ahora. Su hijo esta terminando sus estudios de colegio en este momento, y quiere seguir con sus estudios para poder ser medico en el futuro, entonces actualmente ella est\u00e1 viendo si ser\u00eda posible mandarle a la escuela de medicina en Guayaquil. Su esposo es radiot\u00e9cnico; se dedica a la reparaci\u00f3n de computadores, televisores y radios. A veces hay negocio y a veces no, y \u00faltimamente no est\u00e1 ganando mucho por falta de clientela. \n\nLa se\u00f1ora se dedica a la venta ambulante de zapatos. Vende zapatos de mujer del catalogo \u201cEl Cleo\u201d, y sus clientes le hacen pedidos al contado y al cr\u00e9dito. Ya lleva 13 a\u00f1os con este negocio, el cual inici\u00f3 con un pr\u00e9stamo de la fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR. Se acuerda todav\u00eda que su primer pr\u00e9stamo fue de 130 sucres (en esa \u00e9poca, Ecuador usaba otra moneda, no estaba dolarizado todav\u00eda). Ella vende sus productos a las trabajadoras de la municipalidad, del hospital, y a las profesoras; sale todos los d\u00edas a cobrar y a vender. Como ya tiene bastante experiencia en este rubro, conoce a las clientas y sabe a quien puede fiar y a quien no. Dice que ser vendedora ambulante es mejor que tener un local fijo, porque ella puede salir a encontrar sus clientes y a cobrarles, no tiene que permanecer sentada en un lugar todo el d\u00eda. Tiene unos 30 clientas fijas, y vende unas 2 docenas de zapatos cada mes. Antes ped\u00eda zapatos americanos tambi\u00e9n, los cuales le mandaron desde Estados Unidos en una maleta, pero dice que ya no es muy rentable este negocio y prefiere vender del catalogo no mas. \n\nInvertir\u00e1 este cr\u00e9dito para comprar m\u00e1s zapatos para ofrecer a sus clientas. \n\nElla dice que le gusta trabajar porque le gusta tener sus ingresos independientes, as\u00ed se viste ella y viste a su hijo tambi\u00e9n. Su sue\u00f1o para el futuro es poner una cevicher\u00eda en Guayaquil. Si su hijo iba para all\u00e1 para estudiar dice que tendr\u00eda que irse a cada rato para visitarle y dejarle la ropa lavada, entonces podr\u00eda ser buena idea poner un negocio all\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n. \n","en":"Sra. Ercilia is a member of the Mujeres Unidas (United Women) Communal Bank, a large group of women that meets every two weeks at the ESPOIR office in Jipijapa, a small town on the Ecuadorian coast.  She is a lovely and friendly woman who enjoys talking with people.  Sra. Ercilia is in a common law marriage and the mother of 2 children.  Unfortunately, her daughter died at the age of 16.  Her son is finishing his high school education at the moment and hopes to continue his studies and become a doctor someday.  She is looking at the possibility of sending him to medical school in Guayaquil.  Her husband is a technician who spends his time repairing computers, televisions and radios.  Lately, he has not had much business due to a lack of customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Ercilia sells shoes door-to-door.  She sells women\u2019s shoes from a catalog called \u201cEl Cleo\u201d, and her customers place their orders and pay with cash or on credit.  She started her business 13 years ago with the help of a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir.  Sra. Ercilia still remembers that her first loan was in the amount of 130 sucres (Ecuador was still using another currency at the time and had not started using the US dollar).  Her customers are municipal workers, hospital employees, and teachers.  She leaves home every day to take orders and collect payments.  Already she has gained considerable business experience, knowing which clients to grant credit and which ones to refuse.   As a saleswoman, she says it is better to sell door-to-door rather than from a fixed location because she can go find her clients and collect from them rather than sit in one place all day.  She has around 30 regular clients and sells about 2 dozen pairs of shoes each month.  Her customers would also request American brand shoes, which she would have shipped to her in a suitcase.  However, that did not prove to be profitable, so she prefers to sell through the catalog.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Ercilia will use her loan to buy more shoes to offer to her clients.  She enjoys working because she likes having her own income, which she uses to buy clothes for herself and her son also.  Her dream for the future is to open a <i>cevicher\u00eda<\/i> in Guayaquil.  If her son ends up going to medical school there, then she could visit him all the time and do his laundry.

(0) is a 46-year-old woman living in the town of Auala.  She is married and has 7 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Iuni owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Iuni has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 250 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Iuni joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Iuni has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Iuni is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Iuni plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They live in a wooden house located in the beautiful jungle of Cusco, specifically in the community of Sirenachayocc.  From a young age, Karina was taught the value of work and always wanted to help her parents with the farming duties or any other task that she was assigned.  She grew cacao and coffee to sell to retailers, but the prices they offered were too low, so she decided to start a business selling these products.  Karina opened her own store so that she could become independent and apply the lessons her parents taught her.  She has been working in her store for four years and now looks after her son at the same time.  Karina plans to continue her efforts so that she can provide for all their basic needs.  She is satisfied with what she has accomplished and part of her success is attributed to the way she treats her customers with great kindness and attention.  Karina usually works alone, but she occasionally receives help from her husband.  Every two weeks, she buys everything she needs to restock her business in order to maintain her customer base.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. Accordingly, most women in Tanzania receive poor financial support and, as such, have very little income to provide for their basic needs and services. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. In practice, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women; specifically, in a SELFINA sale and leaseback transaction, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client (to provide the client with cash flow) and then leases the equipment back to her so that she can continue to use the equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":129377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

His whole family actively helps him with sales. <P>\r\n\r\nSherali admits he has benefited a lot in the past 3 years from his relationship with IMON International. Financial assistance he has received has helped him grow and expand his business. Currently Sherali is requesting a loan of 3253 Somoni for a term of 9 months to increase his stock.

We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.  \r\n<P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With your help, Israel can advance his business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":259922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase work materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Linares","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"24.857778 -99.567778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2009-02-20T00:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Israel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T07:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1209.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349995},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1209.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037262},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-03T08:34:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1209.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927672},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1209.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382750},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1209.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889438},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":1166.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1209,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110966}],"funded_date":"2009-02-20T01:34:39Z","paid_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":94008,"name":"Luis Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis Alberto T.

Currently she works from a stall rented in the Central Market, with local inhabitants and housewives as her customers.\r\nWith part of the S\/.3,000 loan, she will buy live chickens in crates, and with the other part she will purchase new equipment such as digital scales to replace what she has now. \r\nToday Raquel is an independent woman who runs her own business and makes all the decisions.\r\nShe says that belonging to a group of women has helped her to understand her rights and together they make other people respect them.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":321884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase chickens in crates and new digital scales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-05-26T20:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":500.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44591086},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:26:12Z","rounded_local_amount":500.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52985372},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":500.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205786},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":500.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635013},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":500.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074075},{"amount":166.65,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":500.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989531}],"funded_date":"2009-05-27T02:27:08Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T02:09:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":114488,"name":"Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L. is a 48 year old female living in the town of Nghi L\u1ed9c.

She is 35 years old, married to Abner A., has four school-age children, and lives in the village of Purok 30, Barangay Taloc, Bago City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nAbner, her husband, earns a living by driving a jeepney. Jeepneys are the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines. The jeepney is like a small bus except that the passenger entrance is at the back and the passengers sit side by side on benches that face each other from both sides of the jeep's body. As a jeepney driver, Abner's income is not fixed and totally depends on the number of passengers he transports for the day who pay him seven pesos for the first four kilometers. He has to pay the daily rent to the jeepney's owner as well as pay for the fuel.\r\n\r\nBecause of her dream in life, Jocelyn strives hard to reach it. Even though she had only a small capital, she opened a small general store and she plowed most of her initial income back into the business so that she could offer her customers a wider variety from her store. She joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 to have access to additional capital so that she could expand her business and increase her income potential.\r\n\r\nAs she gained more profits from her business, Jocelyn expanded her business activities by setting up a food-vending business in her store. She offered a wide variety of food products to her customers. She still continues the food-vending because she noticed that food profits were a bit higher than those of her other products.\r\n\r\nAside from the general store and the food-vending businesses, Jocelyn is also engaged in the direct-selling of various products. Most of her customers in this side business are also her customers in the general store and live within her community. She also has a computer station in her store for children to play computer games for a fee.\r\n\r\nJocelyn started the original business eleven years ago and now her four business activities provide her with an average monthly income of PHP 20,000 per month.\r\n\r\nJocelyn is very happy about the outcome of her hard work and sacrifices for her family because she was to able to meet her dream in life. For her previous, 18th, loan she was able to obtain the amount of Php 28,000 and it was used as additional capital for her four businesses and it was paid back to NWTF-Project Dungganon on time without any delays in payment. This contributes to the good performance of Jocelyn.\r\n\r\nFor her 19th loan, Jocelyn proposed Php 15,000 which will be used to purchase additional items for her general store. If you look at the photo, it shows Jocelyn in her general store. At her back is the computer station that is played by the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":392885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is a very kind and responsible mother who is separated and lives together with her son, Cesar, 30, together in their own home. Antonia has always worked in business, beginning by selling clothes in an informal way travelling the streets of the market. Now, after several years, she sells fruit in a small airconditioned space in her house. This business is doing very well, owing to the earnings that she generates. Antonia always goes to the wholesale markets to stock her shop with fresh fruit, and in this way captures more customers. She has been doing this for a year, and has managed to become very well known and loved by her customers and people in her neighbourhood. What Antonia likes most about her job is talking to her neighbours, as she is entertained by this. In the future Antonia wants to expand her business to increase her earnings and live peacefully in her old age. This is her 16th loan with MFP, and she knows that if she pays on time she can access other loans peacefully and without bringing complications to her communal bank, where she is a much loved member. With this loan she is seeking she will increase the amount of fruit in her business and offer a wider variety of merchandise.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":656885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Acquire a larger quantity of fruit to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-02T22:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":292.45},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":314.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":323.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":343.71},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":354.8},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":370.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.01},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.36},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.6},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.61},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":106.01,"local_amount":292.45,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":299.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725484},{"amount":113.95,"local_amount":314.34,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":322.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463586},{"amount":117.36,"local_amount":323.75,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":331.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886969},{"amount":124.6,"local_amount":343.71,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:47Z","rounded_local_amount":352.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327320},{"amount":128.61,"local_amount":354.8,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":363.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195889},{"amount":134.47,"local_amount":370.95,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":380.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269556}],"funded_date":"2010-12-04T18:28:28Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":258748,"name":"Mishi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mishi is a widow with two children, one of whom still attends school while the other one has graduated.

This location is well-known throughout the country for the delicious sweets made by the locals.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mercedes is 60 years old.  Several years ago her partner of many years died, leaving her a widow.  But from this relationship she had three children who have accompanied her and given her strengh throughout the difficult times.  One son still lives with her.\r\n\r\nShe has a small grocery store in which she works every day from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.  She also sells bazaar items and stationery materials.  She buys her products in Portoviejo and Rocafuerte.  Some of the products such as softdrinks and other beverages are delivered directly to her store.  She says she inherited the store from her parents when they died several years ago.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy more products for the store.  She's been a member of the communal bank for three years and likes it because of the help she receives through the loans.  Her dream is to continue working and staying healthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":725465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy groceries, bazaar items and stationery goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-03-07T10:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:02:08Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201284143},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206152052},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211224886},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216503677}],"funded_date":"2011-03-10T02:29:43Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:05:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":283335,"name":"Abena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abena O. is standing in front of her provisions shop.

Because he has a lot of experience as a fisherman, he is able to get a lot of fish to his wife every day. From this industry, he is able to earn approximately 4 USD each day. \r\n\r\nHoping to have a better quality of life, she and her husband have decided to apply for a loan through HKL, a partner with Kiva. They will use the loan to purchase additional fishing materials. She says that having the support and help of her husband makes it possible for her to live a life of comfort, happiness, and prosperity. Moreover, she commits to paying back the loan punctually to kind lenders. She and her husband are very thankful to all lenders that always help their family stay above the poverty line.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see includes both the loan principal and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is a very hard-working person that has always wanted the best for his family.

He also raises guinea pigs.  Proudly he tells us that he just harvested his pea crop and sold it in the city center with the help of his dear wife.

Therefore, after becoming more familiar with the fund\u2019s lending process, she and her husband requested a larger loan to buy a tractor pulled plough and grain harvesting machine. They rent out the equipment according to the seasons. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of their rental business, her husband is a construction worker and she continues to raise livestock and cultivate plants. Their family\u2019s financial situation continues to improve because of their business-mindedness. They have a monthly income of about 4,000,000 VND.

For the last four years, her main task, very early in the morning, is to clean her farm and feed her animals.  She raises chickens and guinea pigs, which she sells on the weekends from her home.  Sometimes she sells at livestock markets near her home.  With the experience she has acquired, Hilda knows that in the first months of the year, sales decrease, and in later months there is greater demand.  This is when she generates the income she needs for her home.  Therefore, she would like to supplement her capital to take advantage of the busy season that is approaching for her business.  This is Hilda's first loan with MFP, and her first experience with a community bank. For Hilda, it is a challenge, because she has heard that solitary work is expressed in the work of the group.  The money she is requesting is to buy more chickens and guinea pigs to fatten for her customers during the coming months.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Novesky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":323804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase chickens and guinea pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-26T22:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990615},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211726},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":50.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641250},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080688},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":100.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996821}],"funded_date":"2009-05-26T22:45:50Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:17:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":114504,"name":"Gune","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gune S. is currently in the business of selling clothes and is requesting a loan to stock more clothes to sell.

Ellos viajan dentro de la regi\u00f3n de Manab\u00ed para hacer sus ventas, por lo general venden en lugares que quedan a una hora de Jipijapa como Portoviejo y Manta.

She works as a salesperson, selling items for the home on credit from door to door.  For example, she sells sheets, bedspreads and plastic bed covers.  She has been doing this job for 10 years.  Her husband already was in this line of work when they met, and she decided to accompany him on his job.  They travel within the Manab\u00ed region to make their sales, generally selling in places that lie about one hour from Jipijapa, such as Portoviejo and Manta.  Most of the time, they sell their items to familiar customers, and their customers pay them for the goods in weekly installments.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Petita is requesting a loan in order to be able to buy a variety of more merchandise at wholesale.  She says that for the future she would like to have a good economic foundation and a little car, although she does see the difficulty of achieving success within the world's current economic situation.  Her sales have dropped recently, and she is considering changing her business sometime in the near future.  Her husband is also a cabinet-maker, and she would like run a carpentry business with him.  She thinks that such a business would be more stable, and would give them the chance to remain closer to their children as well (a cousin watches over them when she and her husband go out to sell).\r\n \r\nSe\u00f1ora Petita is a member of the Banco Comunal Nuevos Horizontes, which meets every 2 weeks in Jipijapa, Manab\u00ed, near the Ecuadorian coast.  Her bank is a large group that has worked many times with Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, and whose members support each other very well.  Se\u00f1ora Petita has spent 3 years working with her communal bank, and says that she likes it because ther are few places that are able to provide her with money so easily, without demanding excessive guarantees or paperwork.  The important thing, Se\u00f1ora Petita says, is to be responsible.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":363526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Comprar m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda surtida al por mayor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Jipijapa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petita Jacoba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035131},{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":82.5,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035132},{"amount":169.45,"local_amount":165.68,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":169.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947388},{"amount":83.67,"local_amount":81.82,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":83.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789230},{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":82.5,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":84.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789231},{"amount":84.37,"local_amount":82.5,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":84.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789232}],"funded_date":"2009-09-02T22:09:46Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":130904,"name":"Beatrice N.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings!) from Tanzania.

All of them are the pride of their parents.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is an enterprising lady who is not afraid of challenges and therefore she started selling gas (cylinders) 6 years ago at her house.

She has two premises and works with two young men who help her with the distribution of the cylinders.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is also supported by her children and she is very happy as business has grown rapidly and is very profitable. Victoria likes her job as it is not a heavy one as she only administers. She works directly with a recognized gas company in Peru which gives warranty, and Victoria says it is not important that she earns less, the important thing is to offer security to the customers who buy gas on a monthly basis, and have confidence in her.

These individuals\u2019 livelihoods consists of sales including artistic manufactured and handcrafted wood pieces, the installation and maintenance of stoves, heaters, etc., and the sale of Avon cosmetic catalogue items, perfumes, firewood and coal, handcrafted steel structure items, eggs, cheeses and deli-store items.\r\n\r\nWilliam is the president of the group and, in the above photo, he can be found in the second row, first on the right right, wearing a red and black sport-jacket and holding Fondo Esperanza brochures in his hand.\r\n\r\nWilliam\u2019s business consists of manufacturing cars (the structures of vehicles), and also masonry (construction, fences, sheds, etc.). He has two employees that he oversees and they assist him in this work. This has been his source of income and his profession for the past seven years; he took this as his calling after completing a program at a professional institute. He will use this loan to purchase a machine that can cut metal.\r\n\r\nWilliam\u2019s dream is to have a professional mechanic\u2019s shop, with all the machinery that he is still missing (which he notes is a lot). At this point he has a small space available by his house for his shop, and it\u2019s slowly being adapted. William would also like to provide employment for more people and continue perfecting his profession.\r\n\r\nWilliam is grateful to Fondo Esperanza as it\u2019s been the only place where he\u2019s been able to obtain a loan as he has no credit history. That is to say, he has never had a credit card, which other financial institutions look at as a bad indicator, such that they neglect providing loans to those who seek to improve their business.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of Araucan\u00eda Region. It is located 670 kilometers south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lakeside spa resorts and striking native flora and fauna. This region is also noteworthy for being the region where 50% of Chile's existing indigenous Mapuche community live, some of whom are members of Fondo Esperanza communal banks.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":581533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal

Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 which she intends to use to buy more fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and education of her children.

Elmira believes that education will open new doors into the future for her son. She says she\u2019s lucky to work at the same place as her husband. It allows her to spend more time with him and quickly solve various problems. She is employed as a janitor, while her husband is a security officer. Along with these jobs the family has livestock and resells them frequently. Four years of cattle resells has helped the family to make major repairs in the house and a shed. The revenue is usually spent on family needs and invested back in the business. Elmira and her group have know each other for a very long period, and are sure to repay the loan successfully. Elmira\u2019s purpose for the loan is to invest these funds back in her business and buy some more cattle.

She buys groceries like canned goods, condiments, milk, and sugar: primary commodities that are needed in every household. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors in the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 23,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more grocery items in order to have more inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. It will help to attract more customers to buy in her variety store. More sales will result in more profits. It will help her to save more money for her utility bills. \r\n\r\nBaruela hopes that her business will continue to generate an income that is sufficient enough for the needs of her family. She dreams that she can continue to help some of her extended family. She wants to share her blessings with those who are in need. She hopes that her children will have their own families someday. She is active in attending the weekly fellowship* as it inspires her to be more God-loving, and it strengthens her spiritual life.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

They live in polygamous families with their husbands, their husbands\u2019 other wives, and their children in the village of Sikouna 2 (Koulikoro Region, Republic of Mali). Their business consists of selling charcoal, which they buy from farmers who have licenses to cut down trees and produce charcoal. They have a place to store the charcoal in their family homes and generally sell it retail to a diverse clientele (men and women) and wholesale to people who have market stands in big cities like S\u00e9gou Fana and Bamako. Brought together by the fact that they are in the same trade, live in the same village and are each experienced in business, the members of the group decided that in order to generate additional income, they would join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, from which they are receiving their first group loan. With this loan, they intend to buy an average of 25 bags of charcoal each (1,000 CFA francs per bag). Each bag will then be sold for 1,500 CFA francs, generating a weekly profit of 12,500 CFA francs. This profit will help pay off the interest on the loan and will above all help them to develop their business.

She would like to buy her goods in bulk whenever she travels to the city in order to reduce the problem of frequent treks. \r\n\r\nGladys' village bank is called \u201cfear not\u201d. She hopes to receive GH\u00a2500 to improve her business by restocking her inventory. It has been her dream to equip her children with a quality education.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They live happily with their four children in the village of San Nicolas, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. They want their children to finish their studies and become successful someday. \r\n\r\nHer husband works as a tricycle driver while Marietta provides Pedicure and Manicure services in their village. She offers her services to her neighbors, especially the employees within their village. Through her patience and sacrifices, she can earn a net income of PHP600.00 a week, which she uses to acquire their daily needs and for the allowances of their children. She wants to offer her services to the nearby villages but she doesn\u2019t have enough capital.

This is very organized group despite this being their first loan cycle, and the members have shown themselves to be very hard-working and dedicated mothers. For example, the group's president makes a living helping her husband weld doors, rakes and wheelbarrows, and they already have a good amount of experience. Neidy is very pleased with working out of her own home beside her husband and close to her children since there aren't many women who work and can share that experience with their families. The rest of the members make a living in different activities such as selling clothing, making and distributing empanadas, candy, vegetables and other food items, and in public transportation. The members say they have a lot of competition, but they keep working to make headway and improve the quality of life for their families. They plan to use to loan to purchase tools such as compressors and grinders, summer clothing to sell, ingredients and materials to make and sell empanadas and other foods, and to repair the vehicles that are the source of income for those who work in transportation. Despite this being the group's first loan, the members are already experienced with group loans from similar organizations, so they know how to use the funds to grow their business and increase their income, which will translate into a better education for their children and a better quality of life for their families.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":478778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neidy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liceth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banesa Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roly Ever","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eldy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1440.63},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1457.2},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1473.97},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1490.93},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1508.09},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1525.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1543},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1560.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.09},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.47},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.32},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.8},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":628.45,"local_amount":4371.8,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4411.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909425},{"amount":214.32,"local_amount":1490.93,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909426},{"amount":216.79,"local_amount":1508.09,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1521.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945000},{"amount":219.28,"local_amount":1525.44,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1539.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945001},{"amount":221.8,"local_amount":1543,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1557.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673338},{"amount":224.36,"local_amount":1560.74,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1574.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673339}],"funded_date":"2010-02-02T09:42:18Z","paid_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":176439,"name":"One Word Camp Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pictured here are members of the One Word Camp.

She intends to meet the demands of her customers.
