She sells the firewood out of her home and the smoked fish in the market in their neighborhood. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she expects to make a monthly profit of 85,000 F CFA which will be used to help support the family and pay the interest on the loan, investing any remainder back into her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":364475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of firewood and smoked fish for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.58},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":157.14,"local_amount":71428.58,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":71485.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112764},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":35742.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028334},{"amount":78.58,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":35742.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873661},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:05:46Z","rounded_local_amount":35742.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763371},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-24T12:19:04Z","rounded_local_amount":35742.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152194},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":35714.26,"processed_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":35742.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991083}],"funded_date":"2009-09-13T02:38:57Z","paid_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":131330,"name":"Killa Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Loa socios son miembros del banco comunal \u201cKILLA\u201d, Killa es un nombre quechua, que significa traducido al castellano, Luna;

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His dream is to have good health and savings for the future emergencies that will happen to him and to his wife. \r\nRomeo has been running a rice farming business in the Philippines for 25 years. He always assures that his crop is in good condition to get high yields. The risks he encountered in farming are drought, pests, typhoons and flood.

Svetlana lives in the Vodyanoye village.  This is largely an agricultural region of Ukraine, where many people are involved in growing early vegetables.  Svetlana has three greenhouses for seedlings, one large greenhouse (70 meters x 9 meters x 3.5 meters) and 15 six-meter greenhouses.  She has 35,000 hryvnia invested into the business.  Svetlana has been involved in growing vegetables for 20 years.  Her expenses for seeds and plastic amount up to 25,000 hryvnia.

For this reason she works very hard every day in order to reap the benefits of her labor.  Her husband is a professor, but the salary he receives is insufficient.  As a result, Victoria\u2019s dream is to be able to open a small store in the future in order to continue watching over the well-being of her small children.  For that reason she wants to increase her number of animals with the goal of augmenting her income with the sale of the animals once they reach maturity.  Let\u2019s support a strained young mother so that she can continue sheltering in her heart many plans for a better future.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Debra Faszer-McMahon, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nVictoria es una joven madre que emigr\u00f3 de un pueblito de la zona rural a la ciudad junto a su esposo para forjarse un futuro mejor, fruto de ese amor tiene dos hijos, un ni\u00f1o de 5 a\u00f1os y una peque\u00f1a de 2 a\u00f1os.

Hard work and optimism, traits that she clearly displays, have helped her set up not only a general store, but also some grape farms in the city of Ca\u00f1ete\u2014a city that is located to the north of the capital. She has been working alongside her husband because she manages the business that she set up there. Herlinda is showing pictures of her general store in Ca\u00f1ete. She is now setting up a business in Lima, where she must travel every two weeks, since sales are good during this summer season. For over 20 years, Horlinda has been in business, which has served as a way to provide an education for her children who are now professionals and are grateful for their mother\u2019s efforts, so they try to cooperate with her.

Furkat is 25 years old and lives with his parents. He has dedicated himself to farming potato for more than 6 years. He enjoys being a farmer and finds harvesting his crops especially gratifying.

He will use the money to buy seeds, fertilizer for his plots and also young cattle. Furkat sincerely thankful to all lenders who support him. \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Alona has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Alona joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alona has successfully repaid a previous loan  from PMPC. \r\n\r\nAlona is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Alona from PMPC, a Kiva partner. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":515420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional inventory  and working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Oroquieta -

She is 43 years old. Luzminda is married and has 6 adult-aged children. To make a living, Luzminda owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods, junk foods,  beverages & instant noodles in the local community. Luzminda has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Luzminda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luzminda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Luzminda is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Luzminda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":648510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The oldest is in secondary school and the youngest is in elementary school.\r\n\r\nWhen she found herself alone with all the family expenses to take care of and later even more with educational costs she decided to set up a small store in her house to sell costume jewelry and other things.  She currently wants to buy clothes to sell because what she earns selling the other things just isn\u2019t enough to cover her expenses.

As a member he can obtain a loan and start up a business to raise money, to assist his wife, to pay school fees and to provide food for his children.\n\nHe was trained in business management, marketing techniques and credit discipline, and since then has shown a commitment to investing and repaying his loans. Given this loan, he plans to buy planks for furniture, and day old chicks. His business is very lucrative because he is in the commercial zone where he will always have customers. \n\nHe plans to raise money to invest in an additional line of business and buy food for his family. \n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":708945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"day

She obtained her own customers, especially those who wanted to buy cosmetics and hair products.  Mirlet added to her inventory various small appliances, which she demonstrated in person or through specialized catalogs.  These products complement the merchandise being sold by her mother.\r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest challenge has been integrating her professional growth with her business.  However, she is prepared to become a professional by building a successful outlook on her future.  This is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo as well as her first through Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Also, they rent a small plot of land where they graze their cows and sheep. \r\n\r\nGoharik and her family sell the vegetables and fruit they produce in the Kapan city market, and their beef, mutton, and milk they sell from their farm, often to buyers who take the products to the big city markets. \r\n\r\nDue to the work on the farm, Goharik and her family were able to purchase a truck with which they transport their produce from the farm to the city market. \r\n\r\nGoharik needs a loan of 1,000,000 drams to buy a few pigs, fodder for them, diesel fuel, and everything necessary to harvest hay.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":841517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" to buy a few pigs, fodder for them, diesel fuel, and everything necessary to harvest hay.

She owns and operates a business venture, selling chips.  She has 1 year of experience in this business.    She needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or $83 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Esa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

When she was a young girl she observed that her mother made cakes and sold them.  But, at the age of ten, her mother passed away and her father wasn\u2019t as responsible with the children.  At that point, she decided to put into practice what her mother did and little by little she perfected the art of baking.  She now lives off this trade, making large decorations for parties and events of great significance.  She also continues to offer small cakes on the streets, which is how she started her business.  She gets great enjoyment from these activities and, especially now that she has taken some baking classes, she has attracted a good customer base and proceeds without any difficulty.  This is her fifth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  The funds she is requesting will be used to buy decorations and finishing touches in the city of Lima, because in her area there are no items of this type.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":234698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cake decorations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T00:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madeleine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":334}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.23,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":334.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957812},{"amount":108.23,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":334.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228059},{"amount":108.54,"local_amount":334,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":335.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423291}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T03:57:17Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":82188,"name":"Miriam","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miriam tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su esposo y sus tres hijos que la aman mucho.

She is a cheerful woman who adores her family, for whom she wants to provide financial security.\r\n<p>\r\nSelling cosmetics provided Carmen with many opportunities because she found it difficult adjusting to the work schedules of most jobs without having to neglect her children.  Her products have been well-received by friends and neighbors, who usually place their orders by the end of each month.  As her sales increased, Carmen became more motivated to continue with her business.\r\n<p>\r\nShe believes selling cosmetics can be very profitable because she takes advantage of catalog offers.  Selling products that are bundled with other items have helped to increase her earnings.   In the future, Carmen would like to open a stand at one of the local markets so that she can manage her business comfortably without having to travel to different places.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA.  Carmen is very excited of be part of a nice Communal Bank team in which she gets to work with her neighbors.  The members are also very committed to the development of their group.  She will use the money she requested to increase her supply of beauty products so that she can take advantage of the higher demand expected during the upcoming festivities.\r\n<br

This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future of her family's needs. \r\n\r\nTeresita B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is a very loving and hard-working mother. She lives in her own home with her husband Nestor, age 38, and their 3 beloved daughters for whom they care with great love and tenderness in the hamlet of Cumutay. The family works in agriculture. From the beginning of their family life, she started putting all that her parents had taught her into practice. Her husband has always supported her in caring for their crops and making decisions. She says that they bought some land 20 years ago where they can sow potatoes, peas and corn. They are still working these lands, but they are now far more productive, and their crops are high quality. What Balvina most enjoys about her work is the close relationship that she has with the land. She greatly enjoys watching her crops grow. She now has to work the land full-time because, thanks to the geography of the area, the state is building a hydroelectric power station where her husband is working in order to obtain extra money. She finds her greatest challenge to be caring for her land in difficult weather, since everything can affect the harvest. In the future, she hopes to have the necessary funds to purchase a vehicle.

With the great effort and energy that each one has put in to working as a team, her great art-making talent in her beautiful works have been recognised in competitions at interprovincial: the family representative was her oldest son and now everyone is in search of new innovative designs for their engraved mates.

from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! This is Fatuma A..  She is 38 years old, married, and has five children between the ages of 10 and 20 years old. In 2005, Fatuma established her general store business. Working seven days a week, and 9 to12 hours a day, she earns about $430 each month from this business. She is assisted by her hursband, children, and one employee. Fatuma has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now seeks a new loan in order to purchase additional stocks of soap, rice, sugar, biscuits, and cloth. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately $175. In the future, Fatuma plans to open a new business. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. <P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":140690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks (e.g., soap, rice, sugar, biscuits, and cloth) in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-18T23:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-03T09:47:22Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:29Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200093},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227087},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-07-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:01Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":256327},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-08-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":285068},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-09-03T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-19T07:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315261},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346834},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347574},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970194},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886444},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435730}],"funded_date":"2008-03-20T09:47:22Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":45320,"name":"Laura","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Laura belongs to the Las Shipibas Community Bank in Jr. Martir Olaya, in the Calleria District in Ucayali.

He has approximately 15 years of experience in this business, which currently is the primary means of income for him and his family.  He has a clothing stand in a well-known market in Guatemala, the Roosevelt Market, where women come to purchase his items as well as mothers for their children.\r\n\r\nRufino P\u00e9rez states that he has undertaken to provide excellent service to his customers to ensure repeat business, and also indicates that he sells his products at good prices so that they will return to see him.\r\nRufino buys items to sell such as sweaters, blouses, women and children\u2019s suits, as well as onesies, pants and tops for children.\r\n\r\nRufino comments that during this season he has the opportunity to add another business, given the nearness of the Christmas holidays.  The Guatemala municipality, in the month of December, rents two square meters of space to sell holiday-related items.  This occurs in the famous 6th Avenue of Guatemala Street, a location with a great deal of commerce.\r\n\r\nRufino needs funding to purchase supplies, so he will have the necessary items to sell.  During this season, he has one person to help him at his other stand so that he can make sure both locations are well tended to.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Rufino indicates that he is well-known at the Roosevelt Market where students from San Carlos University seek him out.  He mentions that even professional women visit him to buy his goods, which motivates him further to continue forging ahead along with his family.\r\n\r\nRufino\u2019s dream is to see his family prosper, providing education, good health, a home and, most of all, a loving family.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

Jacquelyn earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nJacquelyn joined Kiva partner, PMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jacquelyn is requesting a loan of 3000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the first she has taken from PMPC.

She lives by herself in a house that her parents gave her, since she never married.  What she wants most is to live a quiet life.  The tailoring business runs in her family, as she learned this art from her father when she was still very young.  Her shop is very busy, and her customers line up for her to make them a garment.  Although she has many customers, she works alone because her income still does not allow her to hire an assistant, who would help her make the orders faster.  What Julia likes most about her job is finishing a garment.  She has been doing this for 20 years, and the most difficult part is staying in the tailor shop all day.   Julia is eager for her business to grow over time and to become one of the most recognized tailor shops in the city of Juliaca.  This is her fifth loan with MFP, and she is prepared to pay it on time.  She does not want to cause problems with her partners at the communal bank, where she actively participates.  With the requested $675 (2,000 PEN), she will buy new materials to make her garments.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel McRoberts, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":364570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy textile materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-07T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:32Z","rounded_local_amount":334.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641694},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":334.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081136},{"amount":112.38,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":334.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997286},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:41Z","rounded_local_amount":334.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842630},{"amount":225.45,"local_amount":668,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":671.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734205}],"funded_date":"2009-08-08T01:52:01Z","paid_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel McRoberts","image":602385}},{"id":131378,"name":"Esmirna","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Esmirna tiene 57 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de 2 hijos que ya son independientes y trabajan, en la actualidad vive sola y en su casa propia.

This city is well known for its Inca ruins and the history that in earlier times, when there was not yet a city where there are now streets, this was the site of the house of the Inca \"Tupac Inca Yupanqui\". The town is very interesting not only for its ruins and the temple, but for the dress and customs as well as the colorful and well attended Sunday fair.\r\n\r\nWhile visiting this communal bank Mateo Pumacahua, we talked with a member, Paulina, who is 66 years old, is married, has 3 children, and lives in the city of Chinchero in the department of Cusco. Her principal work is providing food service. She set up a room in her house where she opened a store and there she is able to sell her traditional foods.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a single mother of two children who are her biggest reason to get ahead.  She lives at her mother\u2019s house and hopes to soon be able to improve the quality of life for herself and her children.  For Catherine, the food sales business helps her to be able to earn income to provide her children with a good education.  She works from her mother\u2019s house and has been in this business for over two years now.  She is comfortable working there, as she has time to do other things in addition to having time to be with her children and her mother.  What she likes most about her business is being able to have free time in the afternoons so that she can do other things, as she is a proactive woman.  What she does not like is that she sometimes has to loan money to some diners who take a long time to repay her.  However, she is always in good spirits and she receives her money in the end.  Her business is located near a large company in the city, which is why she has a large number of customers and thus, good daily earnings.  She is starting to remodel her place of business in hopes of increasing business.  This is Catherine\u2019s first loan with MFP and she hopes that it goes well, as she has high hopes of continuing to work with the same group of borrowers.  So far, everyone has treated her well and she feels comfortable.

Chalkhaajav only recently got back to his job just a few months ago. He lives with his wife and his daughter in their small house which is built in the early 1970s.   \r\n\r\nLately his house has became very old and damaged in many parts, especially the floor, walls and the roof. Therefore he decided to make renovations to his house in order to live in comfortable living conditions with his family. According to his plan, he will add insulation to the walls and windows before this winter because there is always too much heat-loss by the uninsulated walls and windows. The loan he is requesting will be dedicated to purchasing some necessary building materials to make renovations to his old house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":934244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

They all live together in a cozy house that is their own.  For some years she has been knitting and crocheting garments, an activity that makes her very happy since it is one of her favorite hobbies.  She learned to knit when she was very small watching her mother, who taught her all of the secrets of this creative craft.  Every day she must work through orders from the people who live in her area, since all of her friends and acquaintances request her fashions in the colors and designs they prefer.  Usually they request these garments for their children, since Maria's specialty is to knit small garments, but when they request something larger she is able to make it without a problem.  The orders are good, and she completes them in the time agreed upon, and for this reason she is thinking of enlarging her business in the future by starting to sell knitted garments wholesale.

However, this ideal path awaits not everybody. And whoever it would be, a person has to be ready to any turn and any situation. The strong people do not expect or dream much about less probable things and just use the best use of the opportunities that life presents for them. \r\n<p>\r\nSiyagul is the leader of this group.

He has a small store that sells drinks and milk products.\r\n\r\nRoberto began selling drinks in El Guasmo to his friends, neighbors, and those he knew. With effort, he was able to remodel a part of his house to contain his little shop. Now, he works from 9:00am until 10:00pm every day, selling drinks, milk products, and other provisions.\r\n\r\nTo restock his small store he needs a loan to buy drinks and milk products and, thus, to have the opportunity to be a micro-entrepreneur. In the future, he wishes to become a drink distributor. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

Hangkayaw, Brgy. Nabulao, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, a rice mill and farming. Her husband, Alipio Loquiso, who is 47 years old, works as a rice mill operator to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 5 and 21 years old. \r\n\r\nHazel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Hazel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to buy fertilizers for her farm so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and the improvement of her businesses. \r\n\r\nHazel L. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon .

She's a trained hairdresser, but is not practicing at this time because she lacks the financial means to open a hairdressing salon. Instead, she sells coolers, basins, bowls, plastic ware, as well as cosmetics and hair care products. Georgette gets her supplies at the Topka market, an international marketplace in B\u00e9nin. She then resells her products on credit in the surrounding neighborhoods. After a few days, she comes back to collect the money from her customers, according to the specified payment terms.

cortes, g\u00fcipiles, blusas y su\u00e9teres; ella sale a vender de manera ambulante en el municipio de San Juan Sacatepequez cerca de donde ella vive. Ella cuenta que inicio su negocio vendiendo 2 o 3 prendas, las cuales ella compraba al cr\u00e9dito y despu\u00e9s de la venta ella los pagaba, pero poco a poco las personas empezaron hacer mas pedidos, por lo que se integro a un Banco de Confianza con FAPE, este capital  le  ayudo ya que contaba capital peque\u00f1o para comprar al contado parte de la mercader\u00eda y ya no todo al cr\u00e9dito.  Sus sue\u00f1os son poder abrir un local propio para ya no vender de forma ambulante ya que tiene dos ni\u00f1as, una de 3 a\u00f1os y otra de 7 meses de edad, por lo que cuando sale a vender es un poco dif\u00edcil llevarlas a ambas,  si tuviera un local propio podr\u00eda atender mejor a sus hijas y mantener su negocio.  El capital que solicita le ayudar\u00e1 a surtir su negocio, ya que sus clientes le piden variedad de colores y estilos diferentes de blusas, fajas y delantales los cuales ella no tiene, ella quiere aprovechar estos meses que se aproximan,   ya que ser\u00e1n las fiestas locales de San Juan  y San Pedro Sacatep\u00e8quez.  Elsa Marina cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo quien es carpintero y a la vez ella ha sido un apoyo para \u00e9l, porque contribuye a la econom\u00eda de su casa,  y al incrementar sus ganancias en el negocio tambi\u00e9n mejora su condici\u00f3n de vida  ya  que quiere darles un buen futuro a sus hijas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ","en":"For the past 3 years Elsa Marina has been selling typical clothes such as lengths of material, \"g\u00fcipiles\", blouses, and sweaters. She is a street vendor in the municipality of San Juan Sacatepequez, close to where she lives. She tells that she started her business selling 2 or 3 garments, which she bought on credit, and after selling them she would pay, but little by little people started making more orders and therefore she joined a \"Banco de Confianza\" with FAPE. The capital helped her, as with a small capital she could buy some merchandise and pay cash, not all on credit. It is her dream to open a shop so that she does not have to sell on the streets as she has two daughters, 3 years and 7 months old, and it is difficult for her to take both, and if she had her own store she could look after the girls while maintaining her business. The loan requested will help supply her business as her clients ask for a variety of colors and styles, different blouses, girdles, and aprons which she does not have in stock, and she wants to take advantage of the following months as there will be local fiestas at San Juan and San Pedro Sacatepequez. Elsa Marina has the support of her husband who is a carpenter and she is also a support to him as she contributes to the home economy. Increasing her earnings, the living conditions will improve as she wants to give a better future to her daughters.\r\n\r\n

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.
