El Sr. Paulino solicita el apoyo para compra de herrer\u00eda y colocar un port\u00f3n met\u00e1lico al frente de su domicilio; este port\u00f3n le dar\u00e1 una bonita fachada a su casa pero lo mas importante ofrecer\u00e1 seguridad a su familia cuando el no se encuentre en casa.","en":"Sr. Paulino is married and is 48 years old. He lives with his wife and two children in a social interest house that he acquired two years ago and that he still pays for at a discounted rate. When Paulino began to pay for his house he always did so thinking that it was also the property of his wife and children, and that if one day something were to happen to him they would not be left homeless. Since then, he has made continual improvements to his home such as putting up flooring, window protection, painting the interior and exterior, putting up fences, and other visible improvements. Sr. Paulino is asking for help to purchase ironworks and put a metal door on the front of his home. It will give a nice outward appearance to the home but the most important is that it will offer security to his family when he is not at home.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.  This leads to poor financial support, which is turn leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys from and leases equipment to women.  Where a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from the said client extending a loan to her, and then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a \"sale and leaseback

He is a 27-year-old married man and has a 6-year-old daughter who is in the 2nd grade. \r\nWiliamo has passed through some difficult times. When he was a child his older sister invited him to live with her in Swaziland. Upon his arrival he began his studies. While attending the 3rd grade his father sent for him, claiming his son could not live so far from his twin brother. When in Namaacha, he managed to enroll in school and later completed the 10th grade. Due to his hard work in school he is solicited for a job at the local community radio station located in the secondary school building as a radio announcer during the hours of 6-8 where he made 1500.00mt monthly. Years later he became involved with a local honey production venture financed by the Namaacha district government. The funding was valued at 125000.00mt for a group of 6 people who were reimbursed every 3 months at 12000.00mt during a period of 11 months. However he was not able to meet these expectations due to poor weather conditions. For this reason he solicits a loan worth 15000.00mt from Hluvuku in order to begin his own business acquiring honey from Inhambane and reselling it in Namaacha. Each trip he purchases 80 liters of honey and resells each liter at 120, obtaining a monthly profit of 6000.00mt. \r\nAlong with his daughter, Wiliamo is responsible for the care of his mother with whom he resides. \r\nThis is Wiliamo's third loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. The first two were used to purchases products for resale. The current loan will be used to start a new business selling honey in local communities. He is very confident that he will pay back his loan before the deadline and that he will ask for a new loan to strengthen his business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

Bineba is the mother of four children. She lives in Ntamulung, Cameroon.  \r\n\r\nShe has been with GHAPE since 2004 and has demonstrated a credit-worthy character exemplified by her repayments, consistent attendance at meetings, and support of her borrowing group. \r\n\r\nR. never had the opportunity to go to school because her parents could not afford her fees and needs, so she resorted to becoming a farmer in her youth. Sadly, her father finally died in 1990 and monkeys ate all her crops last year. She was financially down, but with the management skills she acquired from GHAPE, she was able to repay her loan. \r\n\r\nWith this latest loan, R. is hoping to continue the business supported by her prior loans and add a motorbike business. She has requested a loan to purchase a motorbike and a few seedlings. The seedlings will eventually be farmed during the rainy season. R. is confident that her business will succeed, because her business has been successful for a long time.\r\n  \r\nShe hopes to use the profits from her business to provide for the various needs of her family. As the sole provider for her family of four, R. hopes to increase her profits so she has enough to pay for her children\u2019s school fees and provide for her family\u2019s nourishment.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:\r\n\r\nR.'s loan will be provided by Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE), a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

She also goes to graze her sheep in the countryside while she waits for the planted products to mature so she can harvest them and take them to the suppliers' market in the nearest city so they can be sold.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a single mother and has one seven-year-old son. Mrs. Ana used to devote herself to selling fruit-flavored lollipops to cover the economic needs of her household. Later she decided to get involved in selling groceries, but she didn\u2019t have enough money to expand her business before she joined the \u201cCiudad de los Tres Pisos\u201d communal bank. With her first loan for S.\/300.00, she was able to buy a wider variety of products to stock her grocery store. Later, with her earnings and other loans she received from her communal bank, she bought rice, sugar, milk, noodles, vegetables, crackers, etc, and now she owns a variety store in her own home. With this loan of $525 which she will pay in 6 months, she will buy dozens of different brands and flavors of soft drinks, rice, 50 kg bags of sugar, packets of noodles, oil, boxes of soap, stews of different flavors, and so on, to offer to her demanding clientele.

This is 32-year-old Kristina  M.. She is married and has three children aged six, nine and 12. In 2001, Kristina established her crops-selling business. Kristina requires a loan in order to buy more crops in bulk. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:30:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kristina P.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:56:46Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356217},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347970},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970544},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886761},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436021}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:56:46Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65484,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nguyen Thi L. joined TYM in 2005.

","en":"Manzura S. is a 37-year-old divorced mother of two children.  She lives in the town of Kostakoz, and works as a nursing assistant in a medical clinic.

She is 32 years old. Analyn is married and has 2 infant-aged children. To make a living, Analyn owns and operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Analyn has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005, Analyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Analyn successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. Analyn is requesting a new loan of 30000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Analyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Knowing that a winner never quits, Ma Theresa A., moves on from her past with conviction that she will finish whatever she has started, and finish it well. At 46, Theresa is married to Emilio, an employee, and together they raise a child who is now in high school. Theresa did not finish college, but she makes sure that unfinished tasks will never happen again in her life, or the life of her child.\r\n\r\nTheresa presently runs a sari-sari (variety) store out of her residence. Being in the business for ten years now, Theresa has been doing well in her business and is earning around 9,000 PHP per month. Bible studies and trainings at CCT* also give her enough encouragement to keep growing and dreaming for greater things in her business and family.\r\n\r\nPart of any business is staying profitable, healthy and growing. So to help her grow her business, Theresa has requested a loan for 20,000 PHP. She will use this money to add more items to her store and attract more customers. She also wants to renovate her store and plans to use part of the loan money to start the renovation. She believes that more products on her shelves and a better-looking store would help increase her monthly income.\r\n\r\nAt present, Theresa admits finding it hard to be in competition with many other sari-sari stores in her area. Also, there are customers who are hard to follow up with in terms of their debts. Theresa also thinks of her child\u2019s high school expenses. However, despite these financial problems, Theresa is certain that she will end up finishing the race of life and emerging the winner. She dreams of seeing her business expand and eventually have branches in many locations. She also desires to help her mother out and of course, to see her child finish college with flying colors.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":657304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is the leader of an eight-member group loan offered by Kiva partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n Jessica Len is 29 years old, married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising pigs for fattening and sale. Jessica Len has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP whenever she sells one of her raised pigs.\r\nIn 2010, Jessica Len joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Jessica Len is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be her third from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She is a single mother and lives with her sons in Mkoroshoni, in the Kilifi district. Patricia is a business lady who sells a variety of clothes and shoes for both men and women.

Merbaun Village is situated about 42 km from Kupang City. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group is led by Herman T., a 36-year-old married man with three adorable children: Astri T., 14, in the second grade of junior high school; Zamrud, 5, in kindergarten; and Maria, 1. Herman and his family have lived in Merbaun Village for years. As the head of his family, Herman is responsible for meeting their daily needs. Therefore, he has been working as a truck driver for 14 years, usually delivering sand and stones for his customers. The income that he earns from this work is unstable as it depends on orders from customers. Besides working as a truck driver, Herman cultivates banana and coconuts on his farm, but he is only able to sell these products every six months. By selling agricultural products, he can only generate a small amount of income. Herman realizes that his children are growing up and they will need more and more money, both for their education as well as their daily needs. \r\n<p>\r\nHerman needs to find another way to support his family. He saw that his neighbors had joined the Cattle Fattening Program of Kiva partner TLM and after several cycles of this program they were able to better provide for their families. He got information from a relative about the TLM Cattle Fattening Program, which assists poor farmers in West Timor by providing a loan to buy young cattle to be fattened over a 12-month period. Herman thinks this program is a good way to improve his family's standard of living. So after discussing it with his nearest neighbors, they decided to form a group, called Nekaruut A.\r\n<p>\r\nHerman is requesting a loan of 3,400,000 IDR to buy young cattle to be fattened over a 12-month period. The other group members are also requesting loans to buy young cattle to fatten, as they also want to provide a better life for their beloved families.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":414123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy young cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Merbaun","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-10-26T21:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noakh","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Markus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fransina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thobias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aleksander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":23500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2500,"local_amount":23500000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-02T09:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":23562499.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166921835}],"funded_date":"2009-10-28T14:13:26Z","paid_date":"2010-10-02T09:02:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":151670,"name":"Mean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mean P., 27, is married with four children.

T. is 20 and married with 2 children (ages 4 and 8).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Mainifo has 4 years of experience in this business.  Mainifo needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 tala or US $50 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mainifo joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Mainifo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Mainifo T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Pero el mayor pasatiempo de ella, es la crianza de sus 45 cabezas de reses y sus 50 cuyes, los cuales los alimenta para luego vender su carne al por mayor en el mercado central de Tarma. Ahora quiere sembrar en mayores cantidades y cuidar a su pap\u00e1. Es el d\u00e9cimo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y como secretaria de su banco comunal, se siente dichosa de poder pertenecer a una asociaci\u00f3n antigua que trabaja para el \u00e9xito de sus integrantes. De obtener el cr\u00e9dito solicitado, podr\u00e1 adquirir varios sacos de semilla de arveja, los cuales esparcir\u00e1 en sus terrenos agr\u00edcolas. \n\n","en":"58 year-old Benedicta is a courageous single mother.  She has two children who live in different parts of the country.  Benedicta lives with her dad, 83 year-old Honorato, in their own home which is located in the town of Cochas.\r\n\r\nSome time ago, this hard-working woman used to sell coca leaf wholesale, with the corresponding state license.   Now she has returned to Tarma so that she can take care of her dad who is not in good health.  She helps him with his potato, bean, pea and corn crops, taking good care of them because she knows that their profits depend on it.  Each harvest season, Benedicta takes her crops to sell in the capital.  However, her biggest pastime is raising her 45 heads of cattle and 50 guinea pigs which she feeds so that she can then sell their meat wholesale in Tarma central market.  Benedicta would like to sow her crops in larger quantities and take care of her father.\r\n\r\nThis is Benedicta's tenth loan with MFP and, as secretary of her community bank, she feels lucky to be able to work for a long-standing association that works for the success of its members.  She will use her loan to acquire several sacks of pea seed which she will sow on her land.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":685266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of pea seed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-04T22:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benedicta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":213.28},{"due_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":222.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":232.9},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":243.39},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":254.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":265.78},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":277.74},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":289.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.31},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.8},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.42},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.23},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.2},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.35},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.68},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.31,"local_amount":213.28,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":216.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463735},{"amount":80.8,"local_amount":222.88,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":226.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887123},{"amount":84.42,"local_amount":232.9,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":236.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327485},{"amount":88.23,"local_amount":243.39,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":247.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196031},{"amount":92.2,"local_amount":254.34,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":258.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269716},{"amount":96.35,"local_amount":265.78,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":270.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549725},{"amount":100.68,"local_amount":277.74,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":282.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718410},{"amount":105.01,"local_amount":289.69,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":294.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349965}],"funded_date":"2011-01-05T05:30:46Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":267117,"name":"Khem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khem P. is a married woman who has always done housework as a daily routine.

Muyassar is 41 years old and lives with her husband and two children; having a stable family life makes her very happy. She dedicates her time to growing tomato and onion, hard work that she performs with her husband on their small farm located away from their home. They have been farming for 20 years. Farming takes up most of her day, for this reason she organizes her time so as not to neglect her children. \r\n<P>\r\nMuyassar is worried about the price increase of the fertilizers and other products that help to get good yield from her soil. Muyassar\u2019s goal is for her children to become professionals, this is the reason for her earnest work. The proceeds from the loan that she is currently requesting will go toward for the purchase of good quality seeds and fertilizer which will increase her production and make it more profitable. \r\n<P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<P>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Despite these difficulties, Sofia and her group have found stability in their loans and look forward to continuing to develop their businesses and community.\r\n\r\nSofia will be using this loan, her ninth with Esperanza International, to buy additional merchandise for her store, including bread, juices, and soft drinks. She said that before having loans, it was easy for her and other group members to fail in their businesses because they did not have enough cash flow.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting breadfruit for sale.  Tenisi has 5 years of experience in this business.  Tenisi needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase land to raise additional crops.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 tala or US $50 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tenisi joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tenisi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tenisi A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.89 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.99 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.99 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at: http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

She is married to Amancio S., a shoemaker, and they are blessed with two children. She makes sure to help her husband earn an income so that their family can have a better life.  She has been managing her own variety store for 12 years\r\n\r\nDolores has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than two years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with previous loans, she has been able to borrow three times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to buy stock for her business and help her husband in his shoemaking business. Both their businesses combined let them earn a profit of PHP 18,000 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, Dolores would like to apply for a PHP 8,000 loan.

The official name of this borrowing group is Merlie L.'s Group.\r\n<br>Merlie is 59 years old, married, and has seven adult-aged children. To make a living, Merlie owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Merlie has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Merlie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Merlie is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her second from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Because of its profits, she has been able to support her family\u2019s needs. Being a good mother, Helen has always wanted to support her children in whatever career they would be taking to better their own personal life.  Aside from Helen\u2019s fishing business, financed by the loan she received from ASHI, she also has a farming business.  This is her way of saving her profits to support the needs of her family, especially to pay for her children\u2019s education until college.\r\n\r\nHer husband\u2019s support of her fishing business is Helen\u2019s inspiration to keep growing her business despite the challenges of poverty.  Over time, Helen has been able to purchase a fishing boat for her husband to manage and use for fishing.  Meanwhile, Helen is the one who sells his fish directly to people in local community and nearby town of Jala-jala, Rizal.\r\n\r\nWith that, Helen is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders to be able to purchase additional fishing equipment to catch more fish to sell and support the maintenance of her family's farming business. This would help their business grow, and make more profit, which will enable her to support her ambition in life.\r\n\r\nHelen has been an ASHI member since 2005. Her family is very thankful that she has an opportunity to improve their standard of living through the income of the fishing and fish selling businesses she has established with the support of the loans she has requested.\r\n\r\nThe attached picture of Helen was taken July 14,2010 with her supportive husband, Jesus S.

I., 69, lives in the municipal seat of Axochiapan, Morelos, M\u00e9xico.  She did not finish elementary school.  She is going to use the loan to stock merchandise in her footwear sales business.  She sells women\u2019s and men\u2019s shoes on Saturdays and Sundays in Axochiapan\u2019s main square.  She has had this business for three years.  She used to sell food in the same stand in the market but she was told that selling shoes was a better business and she decided to change the nature of her business.  Her son helps her by taking her to buy shoes in Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato, M\u00e9xico.\r\n\r\nShe started the business investing the money she had saved in a tanda (an association formed upon a core of participants who agree to make regular contributions to a fund which is given in whole or in part to each contributor in rotation) and set up shop in her house.  She decided to invest her money in shoe sales because she commented that she\u2019d rather earn profits with her money than spend it.  Her favorite part of the business is watching her money grow rather than spending it and that she can run her own business.  Some of the challenges she has faced is the increase in competition because there are a lot of shoe stands in the market.  Besides, sometimes the inclemency of the weather prevents her from selling.  She will use the Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad loan to buy more shoes in a style that people will buy more of.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rosal\u00eda M. is married.  Her husband is a farmer.  She has ten children.  All are married and living elsewhere.  No one else lives in her house and no one in her family helps her with her business.\r\n\r\nShe likes her community because that\u2019s where she was born and the people are kind and know each other well. Her business has helped her get ahead with her household expenses and to enlarge the business.  Plans for the future include planting some farmland she has in the local farming area.\r\n\r\nShe is happy to get help from Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad to reach her goals.  Her words for the Kiva team are the following: \u201c\u2026I thank you for the loan that you give us (sic) and for taking care of us so that our business grows\u2026\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":685043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" To buy shoes, boots and sandals for women and men.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"AXOCHIAPAN MOR.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-05T00:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":188.27,"local_amount":2259.19,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2307.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430813},{"amount":125.06,"local_amount":1500.68,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1532.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850066},{"amount":125.06,"local_amount":1500.68,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1532.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292340},{"amount":61.61,"local_amount":739.45,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":755.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160598}],"funded_date":"2011-01-07T22:21:45Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":267133,"name":"Gantulga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gantulga is 46 years old and lives with his wife and two children in Arhangai province in central Mongolia.

Emelia L.'s group is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase canned goods, noodles, soft drinks and bread for sale. This will be her first loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nEmelia is the leader of a 3 member group accessing a loan offered by GDMPC.

She is a kind, sympathetic and pleasant young woman. Hurmatoy enjoys helping people and considers it her calling. That is why she studied to become a doctor. For four years already, she has been working as a doctor in a local hospital. Hurmatoy\u2019s work is very important since she is responsible for people\u2019s lives. \r\n\r\nAlthough she spends a lot of time at work, Hurmatoy still tries to devote enough time to care for her mother. Hurmatoy lives with her mother alone. The only source of income for the family comes from Hurmatoy\u2019s work. Her mother and she had been saving money for renovations for a long time, but being unable to save enough, they postponed the work. Then winter came and it was very cold, forcing Hurmatoy and her mother to struggle to keep the house warm. As a doctor, Hurmatoy cares for her mother\u2019s health and doesn\u2019t want to face the same difficulty during the winter again. She is not going to postpone renovations any further, which is why she requested a loan.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1894355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Shahodat is 52 years old. For fifteen years Shahodat has been working as a market vendor. She sells plates and dishes made in an oriental style in the central local market, which are very popular among the local populace. This kind of china is also widely used for girls' dowry and also for family celebrations. Now Shahodat is planning to enlarge the range of goods she sells by purchasing more china. Hence, she is requesting 2,000 Somoni. Shahodat is an existing IMON client with good credit history, and promises to repay the loan promptly. She thanks everyone supporting her.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road. It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities who still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Till today, it remains a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. Civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous with only 7% of the land being arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural and manufacturing sectors, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Nafanua has many years of experience in this business.  Nafanua needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 1050 tala or US $438 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nafanua joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Nafanua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Nafanua B. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<em>\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She runs her own business buying and selling consumer products. The past loan made it possible for her to buy merchandise in the quantity she wanted. She was able to repay the loan on time and her business has done well, but has taken a small loss due to the drop in value of the Rand (the currency used in South Africa, which is where she purchases the majority of her products). With the revenue she earns from her business, she has been able to improve the financial situation of her family. <p>\r\n\r\nThe previous loan was for 25,000MT, and she used this amount to purchase food products and diverse clothing, which augmented her quantity of stock. The loan was satisfactory, and improved her life, and her daughter was able to get married. In the future, she hopes to access more loans to further improve her business, separating the clothing store from her food products. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michelle

Little by little she has been able to obtain a greater list of clients. She works from 6 in the morning until one of her children arrives and afterwards she sells jewelry until 2pm. With this loan she wants to buy more costume jewelry such as necklaces, chains and tinned goods for her business.\r\n\r\nIn the future Luz wants to move her business to the gold sector because of the delinquency that exists. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":566573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase necklaces, rings and canned goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-07-15T06:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Felicidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":65.07},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":76.61},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":78.76},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":80.21},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":82.07},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":84.57},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":98.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.07},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.35},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.61},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.76},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.21},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.07},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.57},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.07,"local_amount":65.07,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":65.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845917},{"amount":72.93,"local_amount":72.93,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:19Z","rounded_local_amount":72.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172112191},{"amount":75.58,"local_amount":75.58,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":75.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405599},{"amount":76.61,"local_amount":76.61,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:05:35Z","rounded_local_amount":76.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182544070},{"amount":78.76,"local_amount":78.76,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":78.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680824},{"amount":80.21,"local_amount":80.21,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":80.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191379159},{"amount":82.07,"local_amount":82.07,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-23T08:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":82.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797149},{"amount":84.57,"local_amount":84.57,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:22:46Z","rounded_local_amount":84.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201239323},{"amount":85.93,"local_amount":85.93,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-16T08:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":85.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206105773},{"amount":98.27,"local_amount":98.27,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-20T07:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":98.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211862544}],"funded_date":"2010-07-18T21:24:34Z","paid_date":"2011-06-20T07:51:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":217976,"name":"Barselisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Barselisa is a young mother who aims to become successful someday by developing her farming business.

She will be glad if her loan request is granted and she will use the loan wisely by purchasing necessary agricultural supplies to maintain crop production. Her hard work and patience are her foundation in achieving a better life. In addition, the income Barselisa gets from her business is very helpful in supporting her business and sustaining the needs of her family, especially in providing school allowances for her two children. \r\n<br>Someday, Barselisa hopes to expand her farming business. She is glad for the secured opportunity of taking this loan and for your support and encouragement.

It's for this reason she started looking for ways to earn income to support her four children. Her husband is a driver, and he gave her the money to start a business selling new clothing. She started out with little money but then was able to grow her income thanks to a loan. She has benefited greatly from her investments from the loans from Kiva partner Afodenic, increasing her clothing sales out of her home. With this new loan she plans to purchase a variety of clothing for adults and children in different styles, as well as undergarments for women."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":637373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a variety of clothing to keep growing her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-11-13T04:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.14,"local_amount":1055.59,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1089.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189098407},{"amount":47.29,"local_amount":995.61,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1027.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348975},{"amount":48.84,"local_amount":1028.21,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1061.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766646},{"amount":47.59,"local_amount":1001.85,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1034.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209691},{"amount":47.87,"local_amount":1007.71,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:58:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1040.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206078496},{"amount":47.71,"local_amount":1004.49,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1036.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211147551},{"amount":47.79,"local_amount":1006.18,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1038.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216433085},{"amount":47.88,"local_amount":1007.95,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1040.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221598069},{"amount":47.63,"local_amount":1002.8,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1035.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226967793},{"amount":42.26,"local_amount":889.61,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":918.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232726490}],"funded_date":"2010-12-01T00:36:50Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:08:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":250764,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine T.  is currently in the business of selling various items in the shop such as sugar, cartons of salt etc. and is requesting a loan to stock more bags of sugar, rice and beans to sell.

He lives with his wife and their small daughter, along with two sisters and three cousins, in their own home. The work that David does is typing documents into the computer. At the same time, he also offers transportation services on his moto-taxi, which he was able to buy with his savings. He gets up to work these jobs at seven in the morning, and at the moment he works alone. He is happy with what he is doing since it allows him to have an income and, thanks to that, he can cover the household costs. He has plans to expand his typing business as he\u2019d like to offer photo-scanning services since, in the area where he lives, he\u2019s the only business that offers that services. This will be his second loan with MFP, and he feels very happy with his communal bank as he considers the members to be responsible and compliant with the payment of their loans. He will buy a new scanner and pay for repairs to his moto-taxi with the loan he\u2019s asked for."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":908556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a scanner and to pay for repairs to his moto-taxi.
