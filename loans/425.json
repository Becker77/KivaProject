Seeing these women use their loans to start new businesses has encouraged Juana to get involved as well, and she became a group leader. \r\n\r\nThis is Juana\u2019s first loan, and she will use it to start her own small business. Juana plans to sell shoes. She will open a small street stall in her community and sell shoes to people on the streets. This small business will serve as supplementary income for family. \r\n\r\nJuana is excited to embark on her new business venture. She is thankful for the opportunity to take out her micro-loan, because it will provide her with access to capital that she would not have otherwise had. She hopes this will be the first step along a path that will lead to a better life for her

He married at 20 and began to work with his wife selling clothing.  He has a 9-year old daughter.  He soon decided to look for work where he would have a more secure income and now he only sells clothing in his spare time.  He works as a security guard and his wife does the selling.  His inventory has grown thanks to the loan that Afodenic has issued in the second cycle.  He is content because with this loan he will buy clothing and shoes to increase sales. With the better earnings they will be able to live better.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":385443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy clothing and shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-09-09T01:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhonny Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.48,"local_amount":2569.63,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2636.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875932},{"amount":50.52,"local_amount":1010.41,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1036.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713851},{"amount":51.64,"local_amount":1032.8,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1059.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118002992},{"amount":58.03,"local_amount":1160.61,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1190.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841144},{"amount":112.65,"local_amount":2252.95,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2311.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874056},{"amount":54.62,"local_amount":1092.37,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1120.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639444},{"amount":44.06,"local_amount":881.23,"processed_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:03Z","rounded_local_amount":904.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821221}],"funded_date":"2009-10-06T08:50:47Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":139732,"name":"Anatolia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A brave mother to her 6 siblings is Mrs. Anatolia L., 57 years of age, widow and a resident of Purok 3 Sta.

Mrs. Ndeye Sira travelled to Abidjan on the Ivory Coast for a long time and has returned to Yoff. Now she is divorced and the mother of 4 children ranging from 23 to 37 years of age. She chose the trade industry as her passion and started selling rice in Abidjan. Now she sells porridge from the local mill which is called Fonde. She has devoted her time to this activity above all else with the intention of making profits and avoiding financial dependency.<p>\r\nShe is asking for a loan of 200,000 frs. A part of this loan - 100,000 frs - will finance her work. She intends to buy basic foodstuffs from wholesale dealers at more competitive prices which will allow her to maximize her profits. With the other part of the loan, she would pay for her child's school expenses.

Ella pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLas brisas\u201d, y este es el octavo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y como presidente de la junta directiva de su grupo, hace respetar los acuerdos tomados en las reuniones, de igual manera las normas de su reglamento interno, y como todos los socios son responsables, le agrada laborar con ellos. Francisca, muy pronto comenzar\u00e1 la cosecha de caf\u00e9, por ello con el cr\u00e9dito que solicita, comprar\u00e1 varios sacos de abono org\u00e1nico, que esparcir\u00e1 sobre sus cultivos para nivelar la producci\u00f3n, y as\u00ed pueda obtener una buena cosecha. \n\n","en":"Francisca is 53 years old and a mother who loves to farm.  She is married to 64 year old, Luis and they have one son, 33 year old Jarol, who lives in his own home in San Ram\u00f3n (central jungle of Peru).  Meanwhile, while her husband does his job as an aviation mechanic, she cares for her crops, as she has been doing for 16 years.  These include citrus fruits, coffee, and bananas and she works with the help of paid farmhands.  She likes to harvest because it\u2019s there where she can see the value of her efforts.  Some of the farmland is close by and she primarily harvests her oranges to eat.  It doesn\u2019t pay for her to harvest them, package them up sell them to the distributers in the market, it\u2019s better for her to sell them right from the orchard.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she has her own home and land because of her farming.  She is able to live without any concerns, but she knows that she will eventually not be able to care for her land anymore, so she has set aside some space in her home to set up a little grocery store.  She is a member of the \u201cLas Brisas\u201d communal bank and this will be her eighth loan through MFP.  As the group\u2019s president, she ensures that the members meet their commitments.  Like the others, she is very responsible and she likes working with everyone.  Francisca will soon begin harvesting the coffee and she will use the money from this loan to buy sacks of organic fertilizer that she will spread to even out her production and be able to have a good harvest.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":745329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":94.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":98.29},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":102.22},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":106.3},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":110.56},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":114.97},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":119.57},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":124.35},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":129.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.44},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.86},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.86},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.12},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":35.44,"local_amount":94.5,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":99.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196479},{"amount":36.86,"local_amount":98.29,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":103.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270157},{"amount":38.33,"local_amount":102.22,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":107.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550177},{"amount":39.86,"local_amount":106.3,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":111.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718854},{"amount":41.46,"local_amount":110.56,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":116.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350321},{"amount":43.12,"local_amount":114.97,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:34Z","rounded_local_amount":120.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850815},{"amount":44.83,"local_amount":119.57,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":125.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665958},{"amount":46.64,"local_amount":124.35,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":130.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621143},{"amount":48.46,"local_amount":129.24,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":135.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835309}],"funded_date":"2011-04-22T10:37:05Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Farming inputs will be delivered to her and the 56 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nGrace is a reliable member of the community. She is married with nine children. Grace is 53 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last two years to support her family. In addition to this, Grace is very active in her community and involved in the women's group and savings group. She described her harvest last year as excellent. She hopes as a One Acre Fund farmer, to be able to join the ranks of One Acre Fund farmers who have doubled their harvest in their first year of the program!\r\n\r\nGrace joined One Acre Fund in 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. Grace joined One Acre Fund so that she can get the best seed prices, new farming methods, and fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed her family. Because she likes being a leader and an active community member, she wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Grace has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva's representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Grace's life because she has more profits from harvest and more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family. In the future, Grace hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school, save for the future, and invest in a business.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nGrace and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay Kiva's loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizers when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizers for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kautenzia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Willy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":299544,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299544}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Neda Elaidi","image":1353963}},{"id":710756,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Nancy tiene 28 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada y tiene un hijo con quien vive en su casa propia.

She has her regular clients but does most of her sales selling from her sales post. She has worked in her lottery business for 21 years. She started out with $1000 borrowed from a local money lender at a monthly interest rate of 20%, which was a very expensive way to start her business. <p>She started her business on the corner of Banco in Le\u00f3n with a basket of sweets. At the same time she sold lottery tickets out of doors throughout the city.

A. lives in the town of Vahdat. He is married and has 3 children. He has secondary education and was trained as salesman. He started his own business by opening a grocery store close to his home. He imports his inventory. However, he would like to offer not only food, but also a number of other products needed in households. To increase the assortment of his goods and purchase additional inventory he needs funds. Expansion of his store will also help local residents purchase all of the necessities in their town without leaving it.  For this reason, he decided to apply for a loan, which will help him achieve his goals. He plans to pay off the credit within the next 10 months. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva

Over the years, Souzane has acquired solid experience by selling both kitchen utensils and second-hand clothing, even though it was not her business. After she divorced her husband, Suzanne went through a hard time as she did not have any capital to open her business. Souzane then began to sell kitchen utensils and second-hand clothing and made a small profit in doing so. <P>\r\n\r\nBy the end of every day, Souzane would pay back the goods\u2019 cost and keep the little bit of profit as agreed with the owner of the items. Through her determination and hard work, she has been able to save enough money to begin her own business and build a loyal customer base that has began to pre-order utensils. <P>\r\n\r\nSouzane joined one of Hope\u2019s groups named \"M.\", which means thanks in English, last June. With the coming loan she plans to increase her working capital and be able to buy 1 bale of second-hand clothing and kitchen utensils.  This bale will enable her to generate additional profits that will allow her business to grow and change. Souzane is 53 years old and the mother of four children and she also takes care of one other child. She lives with her family in the northern suburban area of Kinshasa."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":235137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To be able to buy 1 bale of second-hand clothing and some kitchen utensils for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Para el futuro Mar\u00eda desea acabar de construir su casa para instalar un restaurante y dejar de salir todas las ma\u00f1anas a la calle. Con MFP Mar\u00eda tiene tres a\u00f1os, este es su sexto pr\u00e9stamo y hasta ahora est\u00e1 muy a gusto con el trabajo que viene desempe\u00f1ando como parte de la junta directiva de su banco comunal, aprendiendo a desarrollar sus capacidades. El dinero que solicita lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de utensilios y de algunos accesorios para mejorar la atenci\u00f3n a sus clientes y hacer que se sientan muy a gusto en su puesto de comida.","en":"Mar\u00eda is very kind with people, with a face that reflects the love she has in her home, as her husband and son are her biggest supporters, and give her more than enough reason to be happy. Her ability to take advantage of opportunities led her to create her own business in the corner of her home, as she realized that with the amount of people in her area, it was the perfect place for her business. For the last 10 years, she has sold breakfast foods each morning from 6 a.m. until mid-day. But her activities don't end then, because upon her return to her home she prepares snacks that she also sells in her area. <p>\r\n\r\nThis activity is very tiring, above all during her early mornings, as the cold or the heat will tire her. But upon seeing her clients and knowing that at the end of the day she will have sufficient earnings to fulfill the needs of her loved ones, she is motivated to put forth much effort and do it with a big smile. For the future, Mar\u00eda would like to finish construction on her home to install a restaurant and leave behind all those early mornings in the street. <p>\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been with MFP (a Kiva Partner) for 3 years. This is her sixth loan and she has been very pleased with the work and her post as part of the directorial committee of her communal bank, and learning how to develop her skills. The money she seeks she will invest in the purchase of utensils and of a few accessories to improve her service to her clients and to make sure they enjoy her food stand. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michelle Harrison, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":286891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy kitchen utensils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-18T01:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":151.98},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":154.47},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":162.72},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":169.23},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":177.66},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":183.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.2},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.88},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.74},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":49.39,"local_amount":151.98,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":158.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117234},{"amount":50.2,"local_amount":154.47,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:27Z","rounded_local_amount":161.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012150},{"amount":52.88,"local_amount":162.72,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":170.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595735},{"amount":55,"local_amount":169.23,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:06Z","rounded_local_amount":176.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989998},{"amount":57.74,"local_amount":177.66,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":185.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211131},{"amount":59.79,"local_amount":183.94,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":192.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640638}],"funded_date":"2009-03-18T02:46:31Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Harrison","image":180524}},{"id":98732,"name":"Djimba Labo","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame T.

She is 45 years old. Irenia is married and has one school-age child. To make a living, Irenia owns and operates a sari-sari (general) store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products, such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste, in the local community. Irenia has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 8,000 Philippine pesos (about $168) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Irenia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Irenia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Irenia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Irenia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is a farmer who lives in Nenas Village, Fatumnasi Subdistrict, Kapan \u2013 in the South Central Region of Timor in East Nusa Tenggara Province. Leon is the leader of Nasaret A2 Group. The group consists of 10 farmers. Leon is married to Agatha Sila. They have four lovely children. They are: Arianto A., 17, who has dropped out of Junior High School since his parents were unable to finance his education. He often helps Leon in farming. Yusti A., 14, who is in the 6th Grade of Elementary School.  Sardiman A., 8, who is in Kindergarten. Sardiman was late to enter Kindergarten as Leon couldn\u2019t afford it.  Nifron A., 5, is also in Kindergarten.\r\n\r\nLeon has been working as a farmer since he was young. He is happy to be a farmer. He is grateful that he has his own fertile land that can be utilized as a farm. Leon plants carrots, corns, bananas, cassavas and king grass. He always tries to do the best that he can to fulfill his family's daily needs. Leon and the group members are lucky as they don\u2019t have to sell their agricultural products at the market since the traders will come to buy directly from them.  \r\n\r\nLeon is a keen farmer and usually works at the farm from 7 am to 4 pm. His wife and his son Arianto help him to water the plants and harvest the agricultural products. Fortunately, Leon has a well at the farm so he never faces difficulty in watering his plants.\r\n  \r\nLeon has dreams to renovate his house and finance his children\u2019s education. He feels regret that he was unable to finance Arianto\u2019s education. He does not want it happen to the rest of his children. \r\n\r\nLeon heard about TLM Cattle Fattening Program from the clergyman in the village. He is interested in joining the program so he can make his dreams come true. Together with his neighbors, they formed Nasaret A2 Group in order to get loans to buy young cattle to be fattened in twelve months. They hope that the loan will help them in improving their lives in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3550,"image":{"id":433896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Nenas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-11-25T18:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3550,"lender_count":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorkas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yahya","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lewi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yohana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Titus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anderias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":33300000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":703.6,"local_amount":6600000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6642018.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195922615},{"amount":2846.4,"local_amount":26700000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:04:34Z","rounded_local_amount":26869981.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211305064}],"funded_date":"2009-11-30T19:13:31Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T12:04:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meg Matlach","image":135964}},{"id":160413,"name":"Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luz es una mujer con mucho empuje para salir adelante, tiene 35 a\u00f1os y vive con su esposo Orlando de 39 a\u00f1os; producto de su amor tuvieron 2 hijos: David de 10 y Jeferson de 4 a\u00f1os.

With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Merly has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to purchase stock for her store so that she can continue to save up for the future. Merly is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":733835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more stock for her general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Hinigaran, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2011-03-26T02:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":871.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201332593},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3486.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206200272},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3486.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211274049},{"amount":70,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3050.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216554106}],"funded_date":"2011-03-26T04:13:14Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:38:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":288061,"name":"Marie Claire","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Marie Claire est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 52ans, m\u00e8re de 2grands enfants qui sont \u00e2g\u00e9s de 33 et 34ans.\nElle d\u00e9tient un restaurant  \u00e0 son domicile  depuis 2ans ou elle fait des plats quotidiens pour attirer ses client.\n Ses ventes journali\u00e8res sont de 25.000F et 45.000F quand les temps sont bons.\nAvec le pr\u00eat  actuel, elle ach\u00e8tera 1carton de poissons sal\u00e9s, un panier de poissons fum\u00e9, du poisson d\u2019eau douce, 1sac de riz, 1bidon d\u2019huile, 1filet d\u2019oignons, 1sac de charbon.\n \nSon soucis majeur est de  pers\u00e9v\u00e9rer dans l\u2019alimentaire pour accroitre ses revenus afin d\u2019avoir un pr\u00eat tr\u00e8s important dans les cycles suivants.\nTr\u00e8s rigoureuse, elle tient que son deuxi\u00e8me fils aille se sp\u00e9cialiser en m\u00e9decine dans un pays plus structur\u00e9 en la mati\u00e8re.\n","en":"Marie Claire is 52 years old and the mother of two grown children, 33 and 34 years old.

They live together in their own home, located in the community of Pilcomayo. Since she was young, she has worked for herself, since her motto is \"progress\". Her main activity is selling food. At first she had a restaurant where she sold homemade food. Over time she acquired a more attractive place, located in a central area. There she started to sell tamales, coffee, juice and different beverages. She works tirelessly Monday through Sunday without stopping, since that's the only way to get results. As she experienced her growth, she faced a new challenge. She married and joined a family, which gives her strength now that she is awaiting her first child. Luis, besides being an exemplary husband, is a responsible police officer who watches out for society's wellbeing. Her goal now is to invest in her restaurant and make it known. This is her fourth loan with MFP, where she hopes to have your cooperation to cement her plans. She also promises to make her payments on time, as she did with previous loans. She also likes being a part of the association because all of its members are responsible people and very supportive. Upon receiving your help, Sherly will invest the money she has asked for in buying quality materials to remodel her new baby's room. 'It's almost done\", she remarks. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":917936,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to improve the infrastructure in her baby's room.

They named their group \"Lane Kuru,\" a Temne word that  means \u201cTrust in God\u201d. They are local entrepreneurs from the town of Makeni. This is the fourth time that they\u2019ve received a Kiva loan through SMT. Previously, each one of the group members received a loan of Le 600,000.00. That loan was a great help to members of this group. The proceeds they earned from the previous loan enabled them to educate, feed, clothe, and provide medical care to their children. Having repaid their previous loan successfully, they are now requesting a new loan for Le 800,000 to further strengthen their businesses and improve their living standards.\r\n\r\nIsatu (right) is the leader of the group. She is twenty-eight years of age. She was born in Makeni and she is married with three children. Her husband is a teacher in one of the primary schools in Makeni. Two of their children are in secondary school and the other is in primary school. While social standards in Sierra Leone may call for the husband to bear the responsibility of feeding, clothing and educating the wife and kids, this is not feasible in Isatu\u2019s household.  Isatu\u2019s husband can not afford all this on his measly teaching salary. Isatu must work to support her family. Isatu sells palm-oil (the most popular and most abundant cooking oil in Sierra Leone) and rice in the town\u2019s main market.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Isatu will expand on her business by buying about six \u201cbarters\u201d of palm oil (five gallons make a barter). She will also buy a big bag of rice with the loan.

Speranza is the chairperson of Mukisa group in Mubende. She is thirty-two years old and has been a teacher in the Tiger Barracks primary school in Mubende for 6 years. Currently she teaches Primary one single-handedly since each teacher is assigned to a class for all subjects. Through hard work, she is thankful that she is managing.\r\n\r\nSperanza has managed a canteen at her primary school for 4 years where she sells snacks like chapattis, samosas, biscuits, and stationery like books, pencils, pens, erasers and reams of paper. During the holidays, Speranza switches to farming where she has banana plantations, sweet potatoes and cassava. She is married with 5 children, the youngest being 1 week old and she cares for 3 brothers and 3 sisters. She has benefited by building her own house, has a piggery business and rears local chickens.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to the credit officer that when he took them on, they were many in the group, taking very little money with many defaulters.

As well as selling food, she also sells beer which many people like to have to complement her excellent food.  Magaly elected this business because it is profitable, and also because with this work she can still look after her children.  And if this isn\u2019t enough, Magaly also helps her husband with the small farm that they have near their house.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells fruits, vegetables, and everything that you would find at a candy shop from her home.  She conceived of her business together with her husband, who for 10 years has been selling fruits and vegetables in the public market of Barranquilla.  The two agreed on the necessity to generate a new source of income for their household, and realized that by running a business from within their home they could create this additional income.  Toward this end, Yudis, without abandoning her domestic responsibilities, especially the raising of her children, has for 4 years now been selling the same products as her husband.  She carries out her sales in the neighborhood in which she lives, knowing that there are many stores and house wives willing to buy her fruits and vegetables on account of their freshness.  \r\nCurrently, Yudis needs a loan of $ 1.000.000 to expand her supply of fruits and vegetables.  This is her second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She applied her previous loan toward diversifying her products, adding sweets to her array of goods, which increased her sales income.  Her family's goal is to own a house of their own. With respect to her business, her goal is to improve the display of her products and her customers' ability to access her.  Her biggest obstacle is the physical infrastructure of her neighborhood; although her location is excellent, the streets in her neighborhood are not paved, creating difficulty for potential customers to access her business.  With this challenge in mind, her community has begun holding games of bingo and other such activities to raise funds to put toward improving access to their homes.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

The story is about Ms. Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda, since she is one of the members of this group. She is 44 years old, married to a construction worker, and has three school-aged children: Leonel, Uriel and Luis Angel, two of whom are studying in secondary school and one in high school. She makes and sells traditional corn-based Mexican dishes such as enchiladas, soups and pastas, and also hand-made tortillas. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda says she chose home-made food sales as her business because it is a very good source of income. She will invest her loan in the purchase of the ingredients she uses to prepare the food which are: firewood, corn, potatoes, poblano and green chiles, jitomates, tomatoes and cheese. She will also buy ingredients for her \u201caguas frescas\u201d (light fruit juices): pineapple, watermelon, other melons, oranges and mangoes. \r\n\r\nHer business is helping now that the end of classes is near since two of her children are going to graduate, one from secondary school and the other from high school, and she will have some graduation expenses for them such as shoes and uniforms as well as the donations they are soliciting at the schools. She would also like to improve her business, leveling out the ground and putting in some flooring since it is a dirt floor, and to buy a canvas to use as a roof for her business, and tables and chairs. \r\n\r\nHer business provides a real benefit to the people in her community because now they do not have to travel so far to buy their food and tortillas, given that some people in her community prefer to buy prepared food so as not to have to cook at home. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda wants her children to have a profession since she herself did not have the opportunity to study for one. She is thinking that in addition to selling prepared food she can sell fruits and vegetables since in her area people have to travel to the city to buy produce and there would be no competition for that business in her neighborhood. \r\n\r\nShe mentions that her group works together very well, since all the members know each other and are very responsible with their payments. \r\n\r\nAnd these are the names and business activities each one of the members carries out:\r\n\r\nOralia S.

St., Brgy. Talisay, Sta. Fe, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  food vending and pig fattening businesses. Her husband Crusilo C., who is 51 years old, works as a foreman in a construction firm to earn his living.  They have 7 children who are between 11 and 30 years old. \r\n\r\nLuzviminda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luzviminda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 16th  loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to pay to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future for business and the education of her children. Luzviminda C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

","en":"The 16 D. Julia group is represented by Carmen Silvia.  It is comprised of 11 members.  Most of the people who make up this group have scant resources, and their income is solely from their small businesses that they set up at Christmas fairs.  When they are not selling toys they sell other merchandise like  leather goods, bread, food, chicken, and soft drinks.  Some proviD. housecleaning services.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to get Christmas merchandise for the fair and to increase their work capital.  The group members have experience with communal banks thanks to previous loans with institutions that are similar to the Agrocapital Foundation.  The members are happy with the economic support from our institution because they will be able to generate more income.  This way they will be able to give their families a better quality of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

For a year, she has been selling clothing at a stall in one of the busiest markets in the area where she lives. She likes her job very much because she can get an income in addition to her partner's salary, and together they can offer their son a better well-being.  \r\n\r\nShe usually works every day from 8 in the morning to 6 in the evening. She offers a variety of clothing that she brings from the center of town in order to sell at a bit of a profit. She tries to get unique clothing with pretty designs and color. For this reason her store is visited principally by young people who want to buy these clothes based on Alejandrina's suggestions, because she is very convincing. \r\n\r\nIn the future she wants to open a store with various products in order to attract more customers. This is her first loan with MFP and as she says, her responsibility in her work shows that she will be on time with each of her repayments. With the money from the loan she wants to buy more merchandise in order to sell more.

She lives at the school and wants to expand her small business with the purchase of chairs and tables for her snack bar. This is why she would like the loan. Her greatest wish is to be able to give her children a house of their own in order to grow and live better. The rest of the group works at selling fruit, soft drinks, flowers, drinks and providing public transportation of passengers as an owner of one's own vehicles or as chauffeurs and another of the members works at renting table football tables.

Pajac, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   a sari-sari (general) store, multicab (a small passenger van) transport and t-shirt printing. Her husband Jaime A., who is 53 years old, works as a multicab driver to earn his living. Their children are between 11 and 19 years old. \r\n\r\nArlene joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Arlene has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loans have helped her build her working capital so that she could stock up her general store with a wide variety of merchandise, which now enables her to earn an average monthly income of 70,000 Philippine pesos (PHP), uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy rice and chicken feeds to sell in her general store so that she can continue to sustainably expand her general store and achieve her dream of opening another sari-sari store in a new location, while continuing to improve the living conditions of her family and to save up for the education of her children. Arlene A. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have become the motor that drives her life.  That is why three years ago she decided to make crochet weavings.  She began this work thanks to the push of her best friend and in little time her diligence had granted her quality and excellent finished works.  This has permitted her community to recognize her as a great worker and they have called her to weave hats for exportation.  Orlanda covers the orders that they make to her to weave which ever article of clothing.  Aside from that she weaves jackets made of wool in her free time in order to offer them for sale inside her community in the hopes of generating additional income that would allow an increase in her family\u2019s wellbeing. <P>\r\n She hopes very much to be able to open her own export company of woven hats and to become partners with other women in her community that do the same thing.  Like a good mother she wants to offer her children a comfortable life and a suitable education so that they can forge a prosperous future.<P>\r\nAs a first step to achieve this goal she has dedicated herself to increase even more the variety of weavings she makes and needs more capital to invest.  She is soliciting $100 USD.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This group is led by Stefanus A., a 38-year-old man. He is married with one mute son who is 10 and one adopted daughter who is 6 years old and studying in the elementary school grade 1.\r\n\r\nBoth Stefanus and his wife work hard to fulfill their family needs. As a farmer, Stefanus leans upon his harvest to generate income for his family. In the rainy season, he usually plants corns, peanuts, cassavas, pumpkins, bananas and coconuts. And in the dry season, he usually plants some vegetables, onion, tomatoes and chilies. Then Stefanus and his wife will sell their harvest to the markets. The nearest market is situated about a 30-minute drive from their village. The road in Bokong Village where Stefanus lives is bumpy with many holes. It is hard for public transportation to serve this area in the rainy season; as a result the farmers in Bokong Village (including Stefanus) cannot bring their harvest to the market to be sold. The income that Stefanus generates by selling his harvest is unstable, that is one of the reasons why he is interested in the TLM cattle-fattening program. Stefanus plans to spend the profit of selling the fattened cattle to meet his daughter's education needs and to meet his family needs. \r\n\r\nStefanus is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner TLM amounting to Rp 3,200,000 to buy young cattle to be fattened over a 12-month period. Just the same as Stefanus, the other 14 members of this group are also requesting loans to buy cattle to be fattened.

Mongolia. The two of them live in a ger, a traditional Mongolian tent home, in the capital city of the ancient Mongolian empire of Khar-khorin. Her grandson currently attends the Technology and Science University of Mongolia. \r\n\r\nBazarsad owns and operates a small store in her town selling a variety of grocery and consumer products. Her grandson helps out at the store by selling ice cream, which is a very popular item during the hot Mongolian summers.\r\n \r\nBazarsad started her shop in 2003 after retiring from her career as an obstetrician at the local hospital. With the addition of the ice-cream sales, she has been able to grow her business quickly and has slowly increased the variety of products she sells. She attributes her success to her good personality and customer-service practices that make her business popular in her community. \r\n\r\nFor the future, Bazarsad hopes to continue to expand her business. Her wish is that she can continue to support her grandson so that he can graduate and find a decent job. She is requesting a 1,200,000 tugrug loan to purchase more groceries and ice cream for her store.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and a vegetable vending business. Her husband, Fernando O., aged 42, works as a Brgy. Tanod (a community security guard) to earn his living. They have seven children who are aged between six and 24. The two oldest ones already have their own families, another works to help the family and two of the younger children currently go to school. \r\n\r\nAmalia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her increase her monthly income to PHP 42,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to purchase more products to sell so that she can continue to save up for her children's education, family security and expansion of her businesses. Amalia O. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting extracted rubber from rubber trees. Gina has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Gina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Gina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. Gina is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to rent land to raise additional crops. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Gina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.
