The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after the country\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

village banking organization located in Manistutu village, near the town of Melaya in north-west Bali. Manis Kasih was originally formed out of the initiative of mothers who, at the time, found it very difficult to obtain loans to develop their businesses. Local banks had numerous requirements that were quite burdensome to the women and thus made it difficult to secure loans. This group was formed to make loans more accessible to women in the region and, given its continued growth, became a legal entity in Bali in 2007. \r\n<br>At this time, Manis Kasih Women\u2019s Cooperative has 126 members, all of whom are mothers of children of various ages. The group is located in a rural region of Bali, thus the majority of the women utilizing these loans work in agriculture as farmers, breeders or traders. Other women own small shops that sell daily goods such as rice, soap, etc. In this group, there are also a few women who harvest rice and one woman who makes cakes. \r\n<br>To meet the needs of its members and allow them to expand their businesses, Manis Kasih Women\u2019s Cooperative is working with Mitra Usaha Kecil Koperasi (MUK) and Kiva to receive a loan fund that will be managed by group leadership in accordance with the rules the members have established. The leadership team pictured here will receive this loan and distribute it to a group of approximately 45 women who are all members of Manis Kasih. The loan money will allow the women to expand their respective businesses by buying new livestock, food or supplies for their animals, or by buying items to sell in their stores.\r\n<br>This subset of the Manis Kasih is headed by Ni Ketut G.. The group has requested a loan of 30,000,000 IDR. Ni Ketut G. manages a small shop in front of her home. Although her husband has a steady job in his village as an officer, Ni Ketut G. does not rely on her husband's fixed income. At the shop in front of her home, she sells all kinds of daily necessities such as rice, oil, writing equipment and various cakes and snacks. She is using her portion of the loan to purchase additional merchandise that she is lacking. This will help Ni Ketut G. earn extra income to supplement her husband's earnings.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Note to Kiva lenders<\/b><br>\r\nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender. This is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner MUK will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.   \r\n <br>To learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please copy and paste this URL into a new browser window: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":490032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy livestock to be bred, fattened and sold","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-02-17T13:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3200,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nengah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agung ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":29920000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":29920000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":3200,"local_amount":29920000,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":29920000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195878556}],"funded_date":"2010-02-18T00:04:56Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":181066,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is a business lady based in Machakos.

central de El Torno en la venta de ropa . El se\u00f1or actualmente esta trabajando en una construccion, en El Torno Bolivia ( El Torno es la cuarta secci\u00f3n municipal de la provincia Santi Iva\u00f1ez, del Departamento de Santa Cruz. Est\u00e1 dividida en cuatro cantones con 65 comunidades campesinas. De acuerdo al \u00faltimo censo realizado el a\u00f1o 2002, la poblaci\u00f3n de El Torno alcanza a 40.000 habitantes.\nEs una poblaci\u00f3n joven, constituida por emigrantes venidos del interior del pa\u00eds: del occidente, quechuas, aymaras y de los valles del oriente, as\u00ed como de las personas aut\u00f3ctonas.\nComo caracter\u00edstica de Santa Cruz, existen grandes diferencias sociales que conviven en un mismo espacio. Junto a grandes \"quintas\", propiedad de terratenientes y personas de mayor poder adquisitivo en Santa Cruz, conviven los propios habitantes de la zona, con construcciones mayormente sencillas (adobe y techo de motac\u00fa). Existe una diferencia entre las poblaciones de Santa Rita y Santa Marta 1 y Santa Marta 2, que se encuentran al borde de la carretera antigua a Cochabamba, donde se encuentran viviendas de ladrillo y teja junto a las m\u00e1s sencillas, y las poblaciones campesinas que se encuentran hacia el interior de la monta\u00f1a, que son puramente de adobe y motac\u00fa, con condiciones mucho m\u00e1s sencillas, donde no llegan el agua y la luz.\nEstas poblaciones se encuentran a una distancia de entre 5 y 20 kil\u00f3metros hacia el interior (en la zona pastoral que deben atender los voluntarios). Dicha zona pastoral est\u00e1 compuesta de 9 comunidades, a las que se accede por caminos de tierra por los que a veces pasan vagonetas para poder acceder a ellas.\nLa econom\u00eda de la poblaci\u00f3n se basa en la producci\u00f3n agropecuaria y frut\u00edcola, as\u00ed como el trabajo de extracci\u00f3n de piedra, ripio y arena del r\u00edo Pira\u00ed que circunda a todo el municipio. Tambi\u00e9n existe una gran actividad de comercio, especialmente en la poblaci\u00f3n de El Torno, donde se instala el mercado en que se venden los productos del trabajo campesino).\n\nEl cliente esta agradecido con la institucion por el apoyo  que se le a brindado ya que podra comprar un poco de material de trabajo y herramientas como ser flotacho, pala y otras cosas mas. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","en":"Santos was born in Pasla-Nor Cinti-Chuquisaca on March 21st, 1977.  He lives with Celia, and they have two children.  He has worked as a bricklayer for 15 years.  Celia works selling clothes in the central market in El Torno.\r\n\r\nSantos is currently working on construction in El Torno, Bolivia.  (El Torno is the fourth municipal section in the Santi Iva\u00f1ez province in the Santa Cruz department.)  It is divided into four cantons with 65 rural communities.  According to the 2002 census, the population is up to 40,000 inhabitants.  It is a young population made up of emigrants coming from the interior of the country, from the west, Quechuas, Aymaras, and people from the eastern valleys like the Aut\u00f3ctonas.\r\n\r\nSanta Cruz can be characterized as having great social differences existing in the same area.  Large \u201cquintas\u201d, property of landowners acquired in Santa Cruz, and people with greater power co-exist with the area\u2019s own inhabitants who live in more modest houses (adobe with roofs made of palm fronds).  \r\n\r\nA difference exists between the populations of Santa Rita, Santa Marta 1, and Santa Marta 2.  These places can be found on the border of the old road to Cochabamba.  You can find houses there that are made of brick and tile along with more modest houses.  There are also rural populations, which can be found towards the interior of the mountain.  The houses there are solely made of adobe and palm fronds under more modest conditions.  They do not have water or electrical services.\r\n\r\nThese populations can be found between 5 and 20 kilometers towards the interior (in the pastoral region the volunteers need to take care of).  This pastoral zone is comprised of nine communities, which can be accessed by dirt roads.  Sometimes trucks are used to be able to access the communities.\r\n\r\nThe population\u2019s economy is based on farming, fishing, and growing fruit.  People also work at extracting rocks, debris, and sand from the Pira\u00ed River, which surrounds the entire municipality.  There is also great commercial activity, especially in El Torno.  A market is set up in El Torno, and farm products are sold there.\r\n\r\nHe is grateful to the institution for the support they have given him.  He will be able to buy a few more work materials and tools such as a trowel, a shovel, and other things.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

N. is a very resourceful person who is willing to take on any venture as long as she could earn an income to supplement her husband's salary as a laborer in a \"hacienda\" or sugarcane plantation. Mildred, 43, is married to Edgardo and they have six children. Their oldest son has already graduated from high school. Four of her children are still attending school and the youngest, who is just 5, is a preschooler. \r\n\r\nWhen Mildred realized that it was impossible for them to make ends meet with just her husband's salary, she racked her brain for ideas on what business ventures to go into.  She went into many business ventures like selling \"Ginamos\" or shrimp paste, opening a general store in their neighborhood and, when she was earning enough, she rented land which she turned into a vegetable farm. \r\n\r\nShe sold her vegetable harvest in the local market and in the neighboring towns and soon vegetable buyers started going to her offering to buy her produce in bulk volumes. Her vegetable farm earns an average monthly income of 5,000 Philippine pesos, which she reinvests in the business, uses to pay for their household expenses and sets aside some savings for the education of her children. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 was paid back in full without any delays or delinquencies. She plans to use her 13th loan of PHP 19,500 as additional working capital for her vegetable farm so that she could pay the landowner the rental fee for the land and for the education and security of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

V. is 37 and married with 4 children (ages 1 - 12).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Sina has 3 years of experience in this business.  Sina needs a loan of WST $2250 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sina V. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Its inhabitants devote themselves to milk production, and the farmers mainly grow coffee and bananas.  Raising pigs is also a common activity.  It has an irregular terrain, and much of the land is maintained as tropical rain forest.\r\n\r\nRosibel devotes herself to milk producing cows.  She started this project three years ago.  Little by little she has seen how her business grows day to day.  She also says that she feels very proud as a small businesswoman.  She has been improving in many areas of her life, professionally as well as personally.\r\n\r\nRosibel is now requesting a loan for \u00a2656,000 (six hundred fifty six thousand colones) to buy one more cow.  That way she will be able to improve her business and make it grow more.  She says that thanks to this she will be able to have more income and give her family a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRosibel is a member of the Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores Agr\u00edcolas Ramonenses, one of the 100 partner organizations with Edesa in Costa Rica.

She owns a business venture selling lava lavas (bottom-half wrap-around prints worn by both men and women).  Judith has one year of experience in this business.  Judith needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional equipment & tools such as needles & threads.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 90 talas or US $38 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Judith joined SPBD.  This is her first loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Judith's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii and Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Together with his children they\u2019ve been raising cattle for more than five years. These produce the income which allows him to feed his family. As well as caring for his livestock, he also cultivates an agricultural crop, wheat, which helps with the family's diet and provides additional income. \r\n\r\nNemat has asked for this loan to buy young cattle in order to obtain a better profit. His greatest wish is to be able to improve his farm by constructing enclosures and establishing better grazing for his livestock.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

When she was young she used to help her uncles in a shoe-making workshop that is located on one floor of her house, and later, when she had her own family, she didn't hesitate to start selling shoes (according to the season) in the major market in the area. She makes shoes one day a week and during the remaining 5 working days she sells them. She says that her merchandise sells-out constantly and so she frequently needs capital. This is why she is requesting a loan that will enable her to buy materials to make, along with her family, a greater quantity of shoes and sandals. As she is an enterprising woman, for the future she plans to start a store selling clothes and shoes in the neighborhood market.

Ella se dedica principalmente a labores del campo, espec\u00edficamente a la siembra de productos como: papaya, caf\u00e9, ma\u00edz, ki\u00f3n y pl\u00e1tanos en terrenos de su propiedad. Hace 2 a\u00f1os abri\u00f3 una peque\u00f1a bodega en el hogar donde vive, de esa manera genera m\u00e1s ingresos para su familia. Con su esfuerzo y el apoyo de sus suegros a podido mantener a su hijo; ya que su esposo se encuentra en la ciudad de Lima dedic\u00e1ndose a la m\u00fasica, por tal motivo no la visita con frecuencia. Meliza comenta que, la venta del caf\u00e9 y ma\u00edz son rentables y tiene mucha demanda en la ciudad de Pichanaki. La falta de capital hizo que no pueda sembrar sus productos en cantidades que ella deseaba, por lo que anhela ampliar sus cosechas en las parcelas de sus suegros y con suerte al pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o construir\u00e1 su casa y ampliar\u00e1 su negocio. Es la primera vez que Meliza obtiene un pr\u00e9stamo de MFP, por esa raz\u00f3n tiene muchas expectativas en el trabajo con su banco comunal en donde se siente muy c\u00f3moda y entusiasta. Con el financiamiento que espera obtener, ella comprar\u00e1 semillas de caf\u00e9 y ki\u00f3n; as\u00ed como invertir en la mano de obra que requieren los cultivos que, seg\u00fan comenta Meliza, cuesta de 20 a 25 soles al d\u00eda por pe\u00f3n.\n\n","en":"Meliza is 23 years old. Eight years ago she married Willy, the father of her only child, an 8-year-old son. She lives at her in-law's house.\r\nShe does mainly rural work, specifically sowing produce such as papayas, coffee, corn, ginger and plantains in the land she owns. Two years ago she opened a small grocery store at home in order to get more income for her family. With her own efforts, as well as her in-law's help, she has been able to support her son. Her husband is in the city of Lima working in music and for that reason he doesn't visit often.\r\nMeliza reports that coffee and corn sales are profitable and there is much demand for it in the town of Pichanaki. For lack of working capital, she can't sow her produce in the quantities she would like to. That's why she wishes to expand her harvests in her in-law's plot. With luck, next year she will build her house and expand her business.\r\nThis is the first time she receives a loan from MFP. For that reason she has great expectations for her work with the communal bank, in which she feels very comfortable and enthusiastic. With the loan she hopes to get, she will purchase coffee and ginger seeds. She will also use it to hire labor which is needed for farming. Meliza says that each rural worker costs 20 to 25 soles a day."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":892327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase coffee and ginger seeds and to hire rural workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-12T00:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Meliza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1028.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097835}],"funded_date":"2011-10-12T12:09:56Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":349250,"name":"Munhotgon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Munhotgon is 30 years old and lives with her two sisters, two brothers and two children in a ger (a Mongolian yurt) in Govisumber, Mongolia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Baresbes, Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 42 years old. Gloria is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nGloria is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Gloria owns & operates a general store selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Gloria has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gloria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gloria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Gloria is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Gloria from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":532362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Only strong people are capable of overcoming such psychological troubles and of making themselves focus on work while hoping for a change to the patter. Reading this group\u2019s story, it becomes clear that many such strong people may be found next to us every day.\r\n\r\nMira I. is this group\u2019s leader. She is 43 years old. She is the mother of three children. The oldest daughter is 18 years old; the middle child, a son, is 14; and the youngest daughter is only seven. Initially, Mira had chosen a fairly traditional profession for herself\u2014grammar school teacher. Yet in today\u2019s conditions when civil servants are hardly getting paid, it has become necessary for her to find an additional source of income. This is how Mira\u2019s husband became a farmer, and Mira has been helping her husband as much as she could. Getting used to a new professional occupation is not easy. Yet Mira was firmly set on improving her family\u2019s life conditions and she had no choice but to learn a new trade. By now she and her husband no longer need to consult others about the right steps to follow when planting and growing their crops. Mira has requested this loan as she and her husband need to buy diesel fuel at wholesale prices. They are really hoping to be able to obtain this loan and to purchase fuel. \r\n\r\nOther members of Mira\u2019s group:\r\n\r\nAltynbek Z. is 25 years old. He is already married and has a son, born just a month ago. Altynbek\u2019s sister, to whom he helps with expenses, also lives with the family. In order to support his family, Altynbek works as an informatics teacher. In addition, he is actively working in agriculture. He needs a loan to purchase diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nGulzat T. is 43 years old. She is a widow, raising three children on her own. She does agricultural work in order to support her family. Right now she has a pressing need for fuel, but she lacks the financial means for it. She has requested this credit as she trusts that she will be able to manage it all.\r\n  \r\nTalaikul I. is a widow. She has educated her four children herself and is still providing for them as best she can. She does farming, growing various vegetables, and at this moment she is really hoping to obtain this loan, which will allow her to purchase diesel fuel. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":542421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 150 liters [of diesel fuel]","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tup","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-05-20T02:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Altynbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gulzat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Talaikul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3399},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3562},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3758},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3893},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4099},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4289}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.3},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.86},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.57},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.59,"local_amount":3399,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:46:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3553.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931686},{"amount":81.3,"local_amount":3562,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3724.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670698},{"amount":85.78,"local_amount":3758,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3929.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884346},{"amount":88.86,"local_amount":3893,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4070.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151477},{"amount":93.57,"local_amount":4099,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:10:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4285.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177446501},{"amount":97.9,"local_amount":4289,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4484.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182585671}],"funded_date":"2010-05-20T23:30:02Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:56:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":205814,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This Kiva borrower is a 48-year old married man from Lebanon.

running bingo games for the past two years.  She is now requesting a loan, her third from SPBD, for WST$2250 to purchase game prizes. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the enterprise.  In 2007, Luamoana joined SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Luamoana's only access to capital because she has never qualified for a loan with traditional banks.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

This city has been known for many years as 'the city of the royal tamarind trees'.\r\n\r\nHere we meet 31-year-old Ligia.  Several years ago Ligia's beloved husband died and left her alone with her three children aged 14, 12 and 9.  The older children are in high school and her youngest is in elementary school.  She lives alone with her children.\r\n\r\nAfter her husband died, Ligia had to start working alone as she used to work together with her husband.  Her business is selling fish.  She has a stall in the market in the city of Portoviejo where she sells all kinds of fish, both small fish and fish by the pound.  She works from Thursday to Sunday, from 5.00am to 6.00pm.

S. V. is 25, married, with three children. She'll buy a horse and a lamb to raise to sell. The people in this remote area of northern Guatemala take advantage of the rich green slopes to pasture many animals, but mostly sheep. Herds of sheep and the occasional goat pass by far more often than vehicles do.  She wants to use this opportunity to work together with her husband to help support the family.<p>Catarina is a member of the women's group Nueva Vision, or New Vision.

She works everyday in her small caf\u00e9 located within a children\u2019s playground (at a kindergarten school) near her town. Every morning she serves her young customers and the teachers of the school. She offers candy, drinks and food, and on some occasions her children help her with the work. It makes Sofia really happy to be with her children and to generate economic earnings to provide for them. Her future projects are to continue advancing this business, improving her sales and earnings a little more each time. This is her second MFP loan. During this period of work she has demonstrated being punctual and responsible in her loan payments. Today she promises, once again, to continue her positive attitude.

Merlina is requesting a new loan of 4,000 Philippine pesos, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Merlina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":443774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He graduated in 2007 as computer repairman from a vocational training center, an affiliate of The Mongolian University of Science and Technology.

She is single and is the mother of 4 children who are 15, 17, 21, and 24 years old.  All of them go to school.  She only studied through the 6th grade and did not continue due to a lack of financial resources.  She lives in her own house with her children and does not support anybody else.\r\n\r\nShe has never left Boane.  Sabata has had her own business for more than 10 years.  She does not have any employees and earns about 3,500 MZN per month, which she uses to pay for expenses.  She is even able to save some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nSabata has had loans with other banks, but she later decided not to continue on with them.  She found out about Hluvuku through her neighbor, who has already received a loan through this institution.  This is her 4th loan, which has a value of 20,000 MZN.  She plans to use it to buy construction material (sand, cement, stone, iron, etc.) to expand and improve her home.  The previous loans were for 2,700 MZN, 6,000 MZN, and 15,000 MZN, which she put toward her business and her house.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay back the loan on time so that she can receive others.  In the future, she plans to request more loans in order to finish and furnish her house, so that her family can have a more comfortable place to live.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

be some proper conditions. Those conditions can be summarized as availability of water pipes, roads and electricity. If there are not such facilities, people are faced with the everyday hard work of bringing water in carts and building all water providing systems themselves. The heroes of our story are people who overcome these difficulties everyday, and continue to work hard in order to earn their daily bread. \n\nDilaram K. is 49. She has raised six daughters. Her husband works in the Water Supply Department and obtains a monthly salary of 3,000 soms. Dilaram grows cotton and sells it in market. Two of her daughters are married and live with their families. The rest of her daughters help Dilaram at the cotton plantation. Dilaram\u2019s monthly income constitutes around 7,000 soms. This business has allowed Dilaram to marry her daughters. Now, Dilaram needs a loan. She needs to buy mineral fertilizers and therefore hopes to obtain this loan. In the near future, she plans to purchase cattle for breeding. \n\nDilaram\u2019s partners:\n\nMamurahan M., 41, is a mother of three children. She is engaged in cattle breeding and selling milk. Her son helps her to look after the cattle. Her husband is also engaged in some business and manages to earn 4,800 soms. Mamurahan would like to increase the total population of livestock. She needs a loan to purchase sheep for feeding.\n \nAbdimutalib A., 48, is a father of two children. His eldest son is 17 and his little son is five. To provide for the family, Abdimutalib is engaged in growing cotton and corn. His monthly income is 2,100 soms. Abdimutalib has applied for this loan to purchase mineral fertilizers and use the rest of the funds to complete the construction of the house.\n\nDildora T., 20, is single. She is preparing for marriage. Dildora is going to work after the wedding. She hopes to obtain this loan and use the funds to prepare her dowry.\n \n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\n\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\n\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Although her work is informal even so she is known by the people and they place orders for whatever article of clothing they need like jackets, sweaters and pants because they are located in a place where the temperature drops now.  She\u2019s been in this line of work for four years and what she likes best about it is chatting with her customers.  But now, her greatest priority is increasing the merchandise she has.  However, in order to sell she has to cover long distances to seek out customers.  But she\u2019s willing to face whatever sacrifice is necessary in order to reach her goals.  Because of this, she\u2019s asking for a small loan from you to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP and she\u2019s determined to pay her installments on time like she did with her previous loans.  She is a very well liked and respected member of her communal bank.  She will buy clothes to increase the amount of merchandise she has.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":782770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-31T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":119.19},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":126.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":129.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":136.36},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":141.82},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":146.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.7},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.3},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.14},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.18},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.7,"local_amount":119.19,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":123.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550447},{"amount":47.3,"local_amount":126.13,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":130.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719123},{"amount":208,"local_amount":554.68,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":575.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350587}],"funded_date":"2011-05-31T21:46:15Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":308274,"name":"Angela Milagros","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora \u00c1ngela es madre soltera y tiene 2 hijos de 14 y 17 a\u00f1os de edad ambos est\u00e1n en edad escolar, angela tiene una peque\u00f1a bodega de golosinas y productos de primera necesidad, como arroz az\u00facar aceite entre otros ,en sus inicios su bodega era peque\u00f1a y ahora esta un poco mas surtida, angela eligi\u00f3 este tipo de trabajo para estar cerca de su familia, ya tiene 1 a\u00f1o laborando en esta actividad , el dinero del prestamos ser\u00e1 invertido en ampliar su negocio comprando productos como gaseosas, golosinas, arroz, fideos, aceite, az\u00facar, entre otras cosas, el sue\u00f1o a futuro de la se\u00f1ora angela es agrandar mucho mas su negocio para que con ello le genere mejores ingresos y as\u00ed mejorar su calidad de vida, angela esta muy contenta con la confianza que se le esta brindando.","en":"\r\n\u00c1ngela is a single mother of two children who are 14 and 7 years of age and still school aged.  \u00c1ngela has a small store selling snacks and basic need items like rice, sugar and oil, among others.

During the first several years, she borrowed money to invest in breeding pigs. She and her husband also worked for the brick factory to repay the loan weekly. She always chose the loan that she could be able to repay. Besides using her income from the brick factory to repay the loan weekly, she also used it for family living spendings. For every farrow of pigs, she also got a decent amount of money. As time goes by, her family economy improves. Since the local economy also improves and many households invest in pot plants, she switches to this activity. So far, her greenhouse has more than 200 plants. She wants to borrow 375 USD to buy more fertilizer and pots. She hopes to get 600-800 USD the next time she sells her plants.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb N., 41 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 t\u1eeb n\u0103m 1999.

She\u2019s already been doing these activities for one year; she\u2019s open for business everyday, all the time. What she likes about her work as a grocer is that she gets to interact with lots of people. Giving them good service is essential, Elida mentions. The profitability of her business illustrates that Elida is the only person in the neighborhood that has a grocery store, a competency that she didn\u2019t have before. In the future, she wants to build a minimarket, thus enabling her neighbors to have their daily needs met. This is her first time requesting a loan with MFP, and in the short time that she\u2019s interacted with the community bank she\u2019s noticed tremendous unity.

C. and his family are originally from Oaxaca. Since childhood he has helped his mother milk cows for the family's business making cheese and cream.\r\n\r\nAfter school, Flavio and his brothers would help his parents sell the cheese at workers' quarters in nearby ranches. In their town there wasn't much opportunity to advance, so Flavio decided to start a new life in Mexico City and launch a business, helping him learn more and gain experience in making and selling cheeses. He dedicated himself to the distribution of his products in the community's street markets. Flavio gets up at 4:00 a.m. to make his cheese, cream and other dairy products to sell daily. Also, once a week he delivers his Oaxacan merchandise: cecina (cured, smoked meat), mole (chili sauce with chocolate and peanuts), chorizo (seasoned pork sausage), totopos (tortilla chips), tlayudas (large, crunchy tortilla topped with refried beans, meat, cheese, and salsa), chocolate, etc. For this he asks his brother who lives in Oaxaca to send him the above-mentioned products. \r\n\r\nTwo years ago he had an accident; a trailer hit him and for a year he was disabled and lost everything because he couldn't work. Now he has re-started his business and thus decided to start a lending group with his wife and mother and request a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad A.C. to be able to buy raw materials (rennet, salt, calcium, titanium preservative, propane, cans) and Oaxacan products. His sales are already growing. Flavio longs to advance himself and give his 4 children better opportunities.\r\n\r\nGroup name: Las Pe\u00f1itas\r\nNumber of members: 3\r\nRequested amount: 15,000\r\nDisbursement date: July 7, 2009\r\nMember names:\r\n Rosa Mar\u00eda C.

He is requesting a loan to purchase the materials necessary for shoe-making.

She is forty-eight years old and lives in the city of Balykchi together with her family.  Balykchi is one of those cities previously considered to be one of the growing cities; however, due to the breakup of the USSR, it began to lose its potential and became a \u201cdead\u201d city over the course of fifteen years.  Syrga\u2019s husband had to leave the city because there was no realistic possibility of finding work.  He now works in Bishkek.  He was able to start his own business and is involved in reselling cars.  Syrga stayed in Balykchi.  The children were young, and Syrga stayed home with them.  Thanks to her husband\u2019s business, they bought a house ten years ago.  Syrga quickly realized that while they had the means, she needed to build a store and begin sales.  Thus, Syrga was able to start her business.  Currently, she sells refreshments, candy, smoked fish and other food products.  Just in a month, she is able to earn up to ten thousand som ($230).  Syrga\u2019s children already grew up.  The oldest son is sixteen years old.  He will soon be graduating from school.  The youngest daughter is nine years old.

Roselieta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Roselieta is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be Roselieta's fifth loan from PMPC.

En adelante, espera comprar nuevas tierras para incrementar su producci\u00f3n.

Currently those fields are farmed and are more productive than before because as time has gone by he has learned how to obtain larger production of coffee, cocoa beans and coca leaves.\r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys most about the work is the close relationship he has with the soil; he also very much enjoys watching his plants grow.  He has been in this line of work for 40 years and considers the most difficult part of it protecting his fields from the inclement weather because any distraction can affect the crops.  In the future he hopes to buy new fields to increase production.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.  He is very happy to get it because he urgently needs it to improve his business.

Every day Pedro rides through the streets in his neighborhood and nearby villages to sell his delicious \"Raspao\", which is what it is called.

Olga is married and she and her husband support their children.  She has had 7 loans which have helped her improve their quality of life.

Prohok is made by using small fish as an ingredient for soup. Roast Beef with Prohok is an exceptionally delicious menu in Cambodia.

Seven members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.
