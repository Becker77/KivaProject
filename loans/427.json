Her dream is to grow her business to ensure her children will be able to continue their studies.\r\n\r\nXiomara's business is a general store in which are sold products such as: clothing, costume jewelry, shoes, and sandals. Her business is mobile. She has had her business for three years, which began with her own idea that she had to fight for. Because of this she began this business with few products and began to distribute her product but it didn't have (good) results. Not enough people (customers) paid for (bought) the merchandise, so later she decided to invest only in clothes and began to cater to her better customers to distribute her products. This loan is for operating expenses because she has to buy gold-plated (items) in Managua and men's clothing is in different places in Leon where they are sold in a favorable way. Xiomara is grateful to the Foundation and its partner organizations that are helping her get this loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Olivia Engkvist, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Because he does not have a permanent job, he started his master decorator apprenticeship several years ago.  Few years passed, and Sarvar became involved in decorating apartments and houses on his own.  He currently has two apprentices, who help him complete orders decorating houses and apartments.  When he receives an order, Sarvar buys building materials.  He gets paid once work is completed and uses this income to support his family.

She is married to Edwin S., a house carpenter in their community. Her husband used to earn a labor fee of 350 PHP a day. They have seven children with ages ranging from 13 to 25 years old. Despite the hardships of life, Juliet is happy to have her family bonded and cooperative. \r\n<p>\r\nFor her general store business, Juliet is requesting additional business capital of around 22,000 PHP from Kiva lenders in order to develop her business to support her children's education. They will make her proud someday if they are able to pursue and finish college. Furthermore, Juliet dreams of developing her business into a grocery store someday, a goal for which, according to her, patience and hard work will be the key. In the meantime, Juliet is going to buy additional supplies of items such as sugar, coffee, mild detergent, fragrance soap, 10 cases of soft drinks, canned goods, sacks of sugar, etc., to retail in her store using the loan she is requesting from Kiva. She hopes to gain lenders' support in order to improve her living

A. is a 46-year-old businesswoman who has multiple activities but manages to divide her time wisely.  She lives in Bagong Silang, Caloocan City.  Her husband Prudencio, 49, is an employee. They have two children, the eldest is in college and the other is in high school.\n\nAnita is into direct selling of cosmetics.  Like most Filipina women entrepreneurs, she gets rebates from items that she gets from reputable cosmetics and apparel companies on consignment (Avon, Sarah Lee, Board Walk, Natasha, etc.) and sells them to customers on an installment basis.  She also makes rags from fabric trimmings and sells them to customers.  She also repacks and retails powder detergent.  She is also selling electronic load credits for mobile phones.  These combined activities give Anita a sure net income of at least P16,000.00 a month.\n\nShe joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2005.  She has learned from the cooperative the value of saving for the future.  She used her savings for the renovation of their house.  She wishes to see all her children finish their education.\n\nAnita has applied for a new loan with the cooperative amounting to P50,000.00 as additional capital to keep her businesses going.  \n\n\n\nAbout CCT\n\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \n\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\n\n    \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":391083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"As additional capital to keep her businesses going","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2009-09-22T09:47:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":490,"local_amount":23333.31,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T14:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":23728.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87016664},{"amount":280,"local_amount":13333.32,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T16:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":13559.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96929204},{"amount":70,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3389.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103769920},{"amount":70,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3389.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103769921},{"amount":70,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3389.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103769922},{"amount":70,"local_amount":3333.38,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3389.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103769923}],"funded_date":"2009-09-23T10:37:35Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T11:55:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":139893,"name":"New Era Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Siah N. and her fellow group members are from the Foyah Market area in the Foyah District of Lofa County.

M. is 27 years old. He lives in Col\u00f3n, in the department of La Libertad. He lives with his wife and their three children, a six-year old and twins that are barely a year old. Jorge has a microbus business (the name that small busses are called in his country), in which he brings people to offices and different workplaces. Jorge depends solely on this work to support his family, for which he requests a loan so that he can pay for the necessary repairs for the microbus and also bring it in for a tune-up. In this way, he can offer better service to his customers so that they can travel in a more secure manner. Also, he feels very fortunate to have his own means of transport that allows him to obtain earnings necessary for his family\u2019s sustenance. For this reason, Jorge feels it very important to care for the source of his work. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva

station.  Married to Ferdinand D. and blessed with three children, she makes it a point to balance her role as a mother, a wife and a businesswoman. \r\n\r\nOfelia has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than two years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow eight times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  The reason why she was consistent in paying her loans was that she used almost all the money she borrowed to invest in her computer rental business. With the help of her business, she and her husband now earn PHP 70,000 net income per month. They also have two employees working for them.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 12,000 loan. This amount will be used mostly as a source of added capital for her expanding business. She will buy upgraded computer accessories to provide additional services for her clients. The extra profit that she will receive from this loan will be used for her children\u2019s school expenses and to improve the quality of her family's life.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her computer rental business will continue to grow and that life will be more blessed through the years. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":453643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

M.lives in the Khurson region. She is 42 years old, married and has 3 children. She makes her living  buying and selling livestock. Rano purchases sheep and goats, fattens them for 40-45 days and then sells them at the same market for a higher price. Fattened animals can be sold for a higher price since they most commonly are used for their meat. This business allows Rano to support her family. Her business also contributes to the development of agriculture in her region and allows the locals to purchase fresh meat at reasonable prices.

Bakhtiyor is from Istaravshan, Tajikistan. He has been working for the past five years in agriculture and cattle. He is well known as a small producer in his community. His young son is the motivation for his many efforts and the reason why he is always looking for ways to work hard and get ahead. \r\n<p>\r\nHe has applied to IMON International with the goal of obtaining a loan to buy seeds and fertilizer for his crop. Bakhtiyor hopes the loan will allow him to increase his yield above and beyond what it was in previous years. As for his future plan, he wants all of his children to go to university and to get good jobs. You can be an important part of the growth of Bakhtiyor\u2019s business.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In terms of competition, the group members are people who produce and sell high-quality products that they make themselves, which is why they have faithful customers who help them generate the profits necessary for their family expenses. For this reason, they need this loan in order to make their businesses grow by obtaining supplies, materials and the new tools that they need to make a greater quantity of products and offer better services. Thus, they can generate more income, which will allow them to give their families a better quality of life. Regarding experience with solidarity groups, a large majority of the members have previously worked with similar microfinance institutes, but none has ever given them the support and trust that the Fundaci\u00f3n has given them so that they can make progress with their plans of growth, in so doing, giving their families a better quality of life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

They have three grown children who live in the capital of Per\u00fa (Lima) and looking for a better future and an adequate education.\r\n\r\nShe has worked hard since she was very young.  That is why her body became accustomed to the heavy schedules and the activities she mentions.  She currently gets up very early and, accompanied by the music she likes, she starts her domestic chores.  She then takes care of her husband, and they both head to their small restaurant, which sells typical food of the jungle.  The dishes they make are popular in her area because it is the only establishment nearby.  With the earnings they get they are able to educate their children, pay the household expenses, and even expand their place of business.  In the future she wants to operate as a video pub in the evenings in order to get more income.\r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP.  She is sure that she will make her payments punctually, as always, in order to not lose the confidence that the institution and her group has placed in her.  She also mentions that she is happy to be part of a communal bank because her colleagues follow the rules, and this makes them very united.  Alida plans to use the money she is requesting to buy toys to sell, taking advantage of the end of the year parties.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":470543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-15T20:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":59.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124443},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":59.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960184},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":59.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993028},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":59.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717814},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":59.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751489},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":59.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933956}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T21:37:20Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":172981,"name":"Isela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isela J. is currently in the business of selling charcoal at home and is requesting a loan to stock more charcoal to sell.

She lives in the Barlovento de Barranquilla district together with her common-law husband and their three children, aged between 17 and 30 years of age. About 20 years ago she started as a small business owner to have a source of income for her family, previously a responsibility taken on by her husband alone. In 2004 an uncle of hers living in the US gave her the idea to start selling soft drinks. To get her started he gave her a refrigerator with the capacity to hold 700 bottles, one that she still uses. She started out her business in this fashion and the refrigerator continues to be her work tool. \r\n\r\nAna sells a variety of other items as well, including specialized catalogues and ladies' and gentlemen's clothing. Her goal is to add a greater variety to her business and to excel in customer service. Her house is conveniently located and she has space enough to have a store. The neighbors in her district and the surrounding areas will be able to get the items they need, especially office supplies, household products, and beauty products. Her greatest challenge is not having enough working capital. For this reason she has accessed a loan through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. With the loan she has been able to gradually achieve her goal but she hopes to continue the development of her business, opening new opportunities to invest her loan. The loans have increased her clients dramatically, translating into increased sales. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":607024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase soft drinks, clothing and shoes to get ready for holiday shopping.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-09-28T15:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":95869},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100356},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":102029},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":103729},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105458},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":107216},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":109003},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":110819},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112666},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":114544},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":116453},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":121858}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.96},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.9},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.85},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.79},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.8},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.84},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.47,"local_amount":95869,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":96745.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550744},{"amount":55.96,"local_amount":100356,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":101273.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688352},{"amount":56.9,"local_amount":102029,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":102961.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427573},{"amount":57.85,"local_amount":103729,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":104677.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000993},{"amount":58.82,"local_amount":105458,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":106422.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288999},{"amount":59.79,"local_amount":107216,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":108196.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157153},{"amount":60.79,"local_amount":109003,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":109999.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230160},{"amount":61.8,"local_amount":110819,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":111832.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509035},{"amount":62.84,"local_amount":112666,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":113696.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673265},{"amount":196.78,"local_amount":352855,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:07Z","rounded_local_amount":356081.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319827}],"funded_date":"2010-09-30T00:20:32Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":239063,"name":"Lucy  Kalumu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is married and they have three children whom they support.\r\n\r\nLucy is acquiring a first loan from KADET.

Abdunofe, a 33-year-old married man who lives with his three children and wife, has owned a sheep-breeding business for the past three years. Because sheep-raising and selling is profitable, he has become a very successful businessman. \r\n\r\nAbdunofe, whose family members always  help and support one another, works very hard and spends his weekend time with the sheep, cleaning, feeding and pasturing them.

He thanks all lenders for their support. <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes its role as a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Con su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, comprar\u00e1 sabanas, toallas, su\u00e9teres y mercanc\u00edas,   encargadas por sus m\u00e1s aplicados clientes. Con \u00e9ste pr\u00e9stamo planea iniciar el crecimiento de su capital de trabajo para obtener m\u00e1s ingresos y en un futuro no muy lejano lograr ahorros para comprar su vivienda, pues en la actualidad vive en casa familiar y sue\u00f1a con vivir con su familia independiente, construyendo m\u00e1s bienestar de manera aut\u00f3noma.    Edenelson est\u00e1 muy satisfecho con las dos actividades que desarrolla porque en d\u00edas pasados aumentaron sus ganancias en un 33% y esto le ha dado un gran entusiasmo para continuar trabajando fuertemente hasta lograr su sue\u00f1o.","en":"Edenelson lives with his partner and their two children (ages 1 and 2 years old) in the municipality of Soledad. Ever since he left his native village in Bol\u00edvar province, Edenelson has been looking for opportunities to improve his well-being. He found selling sweaters to be one option for earning money initially. This is how he started - with a little capital and a lot of effort. Later, he was able to buy a motorcycle in order to make home deliveries. Now, he uses the motorcycle both to distribute his merchandise and to provide a transport service.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his business life, he came upon many informal lenders and paid expensive interest rates, so that several times he lost money and had to start again because he was very close to losing his motorcycle. Now, this is a thing of the past and he has succeeded in building up a small working capital, which he takes care to protect every day. However, it is a challenge that many times he cannot respond to his customers opportunely because when he sells on credit, he does not recuperate his money quickly enough to do so.\r\n\r\nHe will use this <i>credikiva<\/i> (the first loan he has received through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) to buy sheets, towels, sweaters, and other merchandise for his most faithful customers. He plans to use this loan to initiate the growth of his working capital so that he can earn more income and, in the not-too-distant future, save enough to buy a house. Currently, he lives in a family house and he dreams of living independently with his family to increase their well-being and autonomy.\r\n\r\nEdelnelson is very satisfied with his two businesses because recently, he has increased his profits to 33%, which has made him very enthusiastic about continuing to work hard to achieve his dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":822620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the enterprise.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Aveave joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Because they lack collateral, most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks.<p>\r\n\r\nSPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is), and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  <p>\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.

When they got married, they were empty handed. Ms Nhu\u1eadn knew about TYM fund when it opened a branch in her village in 1994 but she did not have a chance to participate because her children were still too young. In 2000, she applied for a loan of 50 USD to buy a pig and chickens. 3 years later in 2003, she built a nice cozy house with the money that she made from raising pigs and chickens. Since the day she became a member of the fund, she got a lot of support from her husband. He's in charge of the weekly payment and frees up her time for her to participate in the group activities organized by TYM fund: cultural, letters & arts. She is respected and trusted by her peers. She is the group representative for TYM branch 1 in S\u00f3c S\u01a1n. She's requesting a loan of 950 USD to renovate the facilities, buy 3 pigs and 500 chicks to take advantage of the T\u1ebft (new year) rush.

from Mwanza, Tanzania!

Mary runs a livestock business, and requires a loan of $450 in order to purchase additional cows and poultry. \r\n<p>\r\nRaising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. In fact, if you are a regular lender on Kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. Who or what are \u2018kuku\u2019, you may ask. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. \r\n<p>\r\nFirstly, they require little start-up capital: you can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will

Camila

She lives in the Peruvian \"departamento\" of San Martin.  She earns a living making and selling food, from a remodeled room in her house where her guests come each day to eat.  They're mostly local people or passers-by from nearby neighborhoods.  Thanks to a recommendation from a friend and without any other requirement, she received a loan from Manuela Ramos when she most needed it.  That's how she was able to contribute to her family's household expenses and especially to the school fees of her 2 children.

Her husband is a daily savings collector in the community.<P>\r\n\r\nComfort buys palm nuts from the farmers in her community; processes them in her house to produce the oil and sells it at wholesale prices to her customers. Palm oil is a local vegetable oil produced from palm fruit which has been cooked, pounded, sieved and boiled for hours. The reddish substance (the oil) is skimmed off and reboiled to expel its water content. Comfort desires to use the loan to expand her business by buying palm fruit in bulk to be able to supply to more customers.

Zebo is an enterprising woman. She is married and has two children. Her husband is a taxi driver and his salary isn't stable, so sometimes debts would accumulate. To help her husband, Zebo decided to start her own business, designing and making national dresses for women. She began after her first child was born and started with a small machine she already owned. Now she has a small workshop and two employees that help her cover the demands of her clients. The good service and fine quality she offers has made her business grow into a small company. \r\n<p>\r\nZebo wants a loan of 4800 Somoni to buy materials and repair her sewing machine so she can fill her customer's orders.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Akbar is a clothing merchant from Khujand, Tajikistan. He started his small business 7 years ago, and though much hard work, he has been able to develop it into quite a successful enterprise. His wife (pictured) is also engaged in this business. <P>\r\n\r\nAkbar has the qualities it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur. Goal-oriented, hard-working and punctual, he is a natural business man. Funding from IMON International has been instrumental in helping Akbar build his business. His first loan was for US$ 2500 and since that time he has benefited from one additional loan while establishing a great credit history. He has requested a loan of 1000 USD to add to his available working capital. <P>\r\n\r\nThe ability to purchase large quantities of inventory in bulk saves time and expense for him. Akbar appreciates the availability of funding through IMON International. It allows him to take advantage of good opportunities and focus on growing his business so that he is able to adequately provide for himself and his family.   <P>\r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

level as it was before.  Her business was badly affected when Typhoon Ketsana struck Metro Manila last September living their home flooded with water.   Married to Angelito D., they are blessed with four children. Together, she and her husband strive hard to manage their business so that their family can have a better life.  They have been selling sandals and slippers for eight years now.\r\n\r\nEmily has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than three years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow seven times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  The reason why she has been consistent in paying her dues is because she has used almost all the money she borrowed to buy raw materials for their sandal making business.  Their business now lets them earn a profit of PHP 5,200 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 15,000 loan. This amount will be mostly used as a source of added capital by buying the raw materials needed for the expansion of their business.\r\n\r\nEmily hopes that the extra profit that they will gain will let them save money so that they can finance their children's college education someday. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":453632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

She has been separated from the father of her 3 grown children for some time.  She lives with her youngest child in her mother's house in a populated neighborhood located south of the city. She works daily doing embroidery on knit sweaters that are produced by a well-known factory.  She collects the garments once a week and later applies the embroidery to the front of the sweaters, including flowers or the landscape of the mountains.  These sweaters are in high demand in other countries.  She likes this work very much, since it keeps her occupied and is profitable because they pay for each embroidered item according to the details of the needles, the complexity and the time spent.  When she has a lot of work she supports her daughter, since the more embroidery she does the higher her earnings.  In this way she wants to provide a college education for her daughter.  This is her 7th loan from MFP, and she affirms that she is committed to making her payments according to the set schedule, because she wants to continue to take out loans that will allow her to continue working.  In addition, she likes her communal bank because all of the members are responsible. With the money that she requests Alioza will buy wool of various thicknesses and colors, so that her work will provide a good finish to the product and she will have better earnings.\r\n\r\n <br

They live in the brow of the Peruvian jungle located in Quimbiri where she has her own home.  Casilda has always enjoyed listening to advice from her family and through them she began agriculture, specifically cultivating and selling coffee and cocoa.  She remembers starting with coffee crops but in a short time she noticed that her product had a lot of demand and she continued her job but as the years passed, she decided to introduce a new crop, cocoa, so that she can have more customers.  Today her agricultural business is her main source of income and it gives her very good revenue, she has a good status in her area since her products are of very high quality and her potential customers are satisfied with the products that she offers.  A little while ago she opened a small store where she sells beverages for her compatriots.  Casilda usually works with her partner and they make a good working team but during harvest season the farmhands are in charge so they help extract the final product.  The crops are usually sold in areas where people gather.  Her daily routine is to leave at 7:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening.  Her plans for the future are to expand her beverage business by introducing new products like basic household goods.  This is Casilda's second loan with MFP (Kiva\u2019s field partner) and she is committed to pay the quotas during the established time periods as she enjoys her communal group.  With the loan, Casilda plans to buy merchandize and manure so that she can give the proper care to her cocoa and coffee crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Duque, Kiva

They each have different trades (merchant, sales, production, services).\n\nFelisa is 48 years old and hopes that all will turn out well for her so that she can stay with the communal bank through many more cycles.  She likes it because other sources have many more requirements for loans than Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir and they do not offer the easy terms of payment.\n\nShe is 48 years old and has been in the same relationship for the past 32 years.  They have six adult children.  She was born and raised in Calceta and moved to Portoviejo eight years ago.\n\nShe and her husband have a pantry store and also sell empanadas and rolls that she makes.  Their business is located across from a school and the students buy many of her products.  The neighbors also buy their daily groceries there.  They work every day starting at dawn, because they have to go to the market to buy vegetables and other fresh products to sell.  They close their business at night.  They buy their products in bulk in Portoviejo and this generates good profits for them. \n\nThey will use the money from this loan to buy more products so that they can grow their business.  Their dream is to buy some land on which to build a house and to bring Felisa\u2019s mother to live with them.   \n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":606588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-10-06T02:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3300,"lender_count":119,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moserrate Modesta Cecil","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gissella Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Eva Guisella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcia Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessenia Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Fernanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leidiana Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andres Eutimio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jimena Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felisa Del Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":825,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407569},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388748},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388749},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388750},{"amount":825,"local_amount":825,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682991},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422115}],"funded_date":"2010-10-11T00:52:51Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:33:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Shoira is requesting a loan of 13,000 TJS to increase her assortment of inventory and boost her sales. She is ready to continue working hard to see her business grow and thrive. Her ultimate goal is to provide a better life for her family. She also plans to invest part of her profit in doing some basic remodeling of her apartment.

We hope the current loan will also be repaid without any delinquencies, and we are excited to promote the further expansion of Shoira's enterprise. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For this reason, she provides transportation to the public, as a taxi driver. She does this job on weekends and earns good money doing so. She is also one of the few women who does this type of work. Her next goal is to study psychology and she is optimistic that she will achieve it.\r\n\r\nThis is Romina's second loan through Microfinanzas Prisma and she feels happy about it because it has taught her the value of responsibility, which she has demonstrated with her punctual loan repayments. When Romina receives this loan she will use the requested money to pay for the paperwork to obtain her driver's license.

Salma has been running a poultry (\"kuku\") business since 1992. Raising kuku is a popular microbusiness in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. \"Kuku\" means \"chickens\" in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital: You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Salma works at the business for 9 hours a day, 7 days a week. She currently earns about $200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD in order to purchase more chicks to raise and resell. In the future, she plans to open another business. Salma thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania through microleasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed noncreditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Afterwards, she rented out a room to earn additional income to partially cover household expenses.  Her loans have been used to invest in her business and the profits therefrom have been used to make some home improvements which, with help from her employed children, she has been able to accomplish little by little.  She still needs to replaster the walls and to install flooring for better hygiene and well-being of her family.  With this latest loan she intends to buy bundles of clothing so that she can increase her sales because when she brings new bundles of clothes her customers buy several articles because they are still good and at reasonable prices; besides, she has little inventory available because she's waiting for the loan to be approved to go buy several bundles; currently all she has left in stock are sheets and pillow cases.  She has two children that are still in school and she hopes to be able to support them until they finish their schooling so that they can have a better future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

The official name of this borrowing group is Jon-Jon T.'s Group.\r\n\r\nJon-jon is married and has 5 school-aged children. He owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling seafood products, including fish and shrimp, in the local community. Jon-jon has been involved in his business for over 16 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jon-jon joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jon-jon has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jon-jon is requesting a new loan, his third, of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCarmelita is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Carmelita owns and operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Carmelita has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Carmelita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. As with her previous loan of 13,000 PHP from PMPC which was successfully repaid, Carmelita is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This will be the seventh loan she has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Proof of this is that, although she is a single mother, Lissette has brought up her sons single handedly and also helped her mom financially, providing them with a decent home, food and education.\r\n\r\nLike all entrepreneurs, Lissette would like to reinvest even more in her bakery since her French breads and sweet breads are becoming more and more in demand owing to their delicious flavor, texture and size, without forgetting their affordable price.\r\n\r\nLissette's biggest wish is to expand her business by providing her bread not only to her neighbors who come to her door to buy from her but, as it has become known over the years that her bread is very good quality, she would also like to deliver it to neighboring districts in order to generate more sales, more profits and, thereby, improve the quality of life of all her household members.  She would also like her children to go to college and for this to be her inheritance to them.  For this reason, she has decided to request a loan from INTEGRAL with which she can buy larger quantities of flour, yeast, eggs, butter, milk and sugar than she normally uses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":784944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy
