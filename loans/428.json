She is 24 years old. Mary Joy is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\n\nMary Joy is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Mary Joy owns and operates a business venture making and selling food. The main source of income for the business comes from preparing and selling pork and chicken barbeque. Mary Joy has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2008, Mary Joy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business. Mary Joy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make food for sale. Mary Joy is requesting a new loan of 19000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her 6th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to support immediate members of her family. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in Media Once, Toledo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her sari-sari (general) store and livestock businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP16,000. Rosalia is now borrowing PHP 12,000 so that she  can  purchase more stock to sell.   This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.\r\n\r\n Rosalia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her business is producing palm oil. This is a very profitable buisiness that allows Mrs. H. to contribute to the household expenses. Because of the high quality of oil she produces, she has so many customers that she can no longer supply them all. It takes a large amount of money to acquire palm nuts for preparing the oil. Since she does not have this money, Mrs. H. cannot put enough palm oil on the market. In order to fill this gap and improve her family's income at the same time, she is asking for a credit of $850 to purchase a supply of palm nuts and improve her production facilities. This will help her better meet the needs of her family.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Lisa Molle, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMari\u00e9e \u00e0 un p\u00eacheur, Madame H.

She lives in Kaboila, a neighborhood in the center of the city of Sikasso (the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).<p>\r\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts at other businesses, she decided, six years ago, to go into the business of buying and selling clothing. She has had an association with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinancing bank for five years. She has profited from five (5) group loans made with a neighborhood association and is also on her fifth personal loan, all of which have been successfully repaid.<p>\r\nWith this loan she plans to buy 500 pairs of various quality shoes (heeled, plastic and children shoes) at Bamako and 10 pieces of Brod\u00e9 (embroidered fabric) of different quality at Lom\u00e9 (Republic of Togo), Conakry (Republic of Guinea-Conakry) and Accra (Republic of Ghena). She will sell this merchandise as single items (for cash or credit) in her boutique located in the central marketplace at Sikasso. Her clientele is made up mostly of women and many local stall owners.<p>\r\nShe expects to produce a monthly profit of 200,000 francs CFA which will be used primarily, to pay personal expenses, contribute to family expenses, meet the payments of the loan and invest the remainder in her business activity.

She's single, and what she most desires is to have a quiet old age. Throughout her life she's had many jobs, which have allowed her to support herself and live well. Currently, taking advantage of a large patio in her house, she has installed a carport where her neighbors store their vehicles. This is a very profitable business since most of her neighbors prefer to store their cars with her because they trust her. She's been doing this for 8 years, and what she likes most is that while she takes care of her business, at the same time she can do her housework, saving her time for doing other activities. What she likes least is getting up at dawn to attend to people who want to use the carport. Ludith hopes in the future have a grocery store, which would provide more income and improve her situation.

She lives in her own home with her husband WIlliam, who is 37 years old, and the couple's greatest goal is to get ahead in life. She has been making bricks for the past 10 years. Her oven is located outside the city of Juliaca, near the \"Inca Manco C\u00e1pac\" Airport. She and her husband wake up very early each morning to start mixing and molding the clay, which they then allow to dry for 10 days before firing the bricks. Antonia enjoys selling bricks, since she feels well compensated for her work. She says that the hardest part is working through all kinds of weather conditions, since sometimes the hot sun makes work more tiring, or the rain prevents the bricks from taking the correct shape. Still, she continues to work hard each day to improve her quality of life. In the near future, she hopes to open a small grocery store, since there are very few in her neighborhood. This is Antonia's second loan from Microfinanzas Prisma, and she expects to pay in on time without any difficulties, just as she has done with her earlier loans. She is very well respected in her village bank, since she is the most active, committed group member. With the 2,000 soles she has requested, she will buy new molds for roof bricks, since this is what she receives the most requests for. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":364559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Buy brick molds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-06T16:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":334.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641690},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":334.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081132},{"amount":112.38,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":334.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997282},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:34Z","rounded_local_amount":334.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842626},{"amount":225.45,"local_amount":668,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":671.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734201}],"funded_date":"2009-08-06T19:25:42Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":131374,"name":"Roxana Melita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora ROXANA MELITA A.

purposes. Kate loves sarongs too, and that is why she has chosen to make a living selling them. She has been in this business for a long time, and has applied for a loan for N120,000 to buy more sarongs to sell.

She and her family live in Tup, which is located on the shores of beautiful Lake Issyk-Kul. Damir is married, fifty years old with two sons. They have cattle, and the children help them to store food. In addition, since the spring the family is also farming. Damir has one milk cow to produce milk and earns extra income from the sale of livestock. For example, last spring, they bought two lambs for a half thousand soms ($35) and resold them for two and a half thousand soms ($55) in the autumn. From a single sale of milk, they are able to earn up to a thousand soms ($22) per month. They have a rather wide range of occupations, which includes agriculture, livestock, and trade. Damir now wants to buy four lambs and one calf for fattening, to then resell in the fall. She hopes to get the loan and to realize her plans. In the future, Damir and her family are planning to increase arable land from five to ten hectares, which in turn should bring them in twice the yield than before. \r\n<p>\r\nDamir\u2019s Partners live in the same village:\r\n<p>\r\nRoza T. is a widow with three sons. Rose has some livestock. Her children help in the summer to procure forage. Since April, Rose plans to sell milk. One of her cows will calve soon. Rose is asking for a loan, to purchase lambs for fattening.\r\n<p>\r\nRapiya B. is a widow and mother of four children. Her son helps her with the business while her daughters study in school. Rapiya\u2019s cows produces six liters of milk. Milk sales earns her a monthly one and a half thousand soms. She is asking for a loan to buy a cow for fattening. \r\n<p>\r\nTologon T. is fifty-four years old with one son. Tologon sells six liters of milk daily and her son is a farm equipment mechanic. Tologon hopes to get a loan with which she plans to purchase cattle, and increase the stock.

She has been separated from her husband for 4 years, but she lives in her own house in the company of her three children aged 16, 14 and 12.  Silveria is a cosmetologist; she provides haircuts, hair color, hairs waves, manicures, pedicures and other services.  She does this out of a space in her home that she has set up for the business.  She has managed to attract customers thanks to the recommendation of current clients, due to the good work that she does.  She learned to do this work by training in a vocational education center for 3 years, and later she became specialized.  She had her first job in a private beauty shop owned by a friend, and with the savings she managed to accumulate she was able to become independent 6 years ago.  At first she worked alone, but now she has a young assistant who she pays weekly.  She enjoys her work very much, and so she has plans to open another business in an area in the center of the city.  This will be loan number 6 from the MFP institution, and she feels grateful for the financial support that she has been receiving, so she pledges to be on time with her payments.  With the sum of 1,500 Peruvian soles she requests, she will buy supplies for her business such as hair dyes, hairspray, powdered makeup and other products that she will bring back from the city of Lima.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":926642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy hair dyes, hairspray, cosmetics and other products for her beauty salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-22T18:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silveria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":224.97},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":237.72},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":242.69},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":254.14},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":266.11},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":274.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.24},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.12},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":177.36,"local_amount":462.69,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:38Z","rounded_local_amount":478.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836183},{"amount":190.46,"local_amount":496.83,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":514.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385971},{"amount":8.39,"local_amount":21.88,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":22.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099059},{"amount":198.79,"local_amount":518.6,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":536.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713203}],"funded_date":"2011-11-30T15:37:50Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":365805,"name":"Marisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Twenty-four-year-old Marisa runs a sari-sari store business in Trinidad, Bohol.

Their house is made of sugar cane stalks and the floor is of earth.  She hopes that with the loan and their savings they will be able to start building it, little by little, of cement.\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Volunteer Translator <b> <p>\r\n\r\n<p> Nilmida tiene una experiencia de 4 a\u00f1os con el negocio.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

People who want much at once are doomed to disappointment, because a big role belongs to patience and resolution, The heroes of this story cannot boast grandiose success in their lives, but they are on that path. \r\n<p>\r\nFarida is the leader of this group. She is thirty-four years old. She lives in the small city of Tokmok. Many people of her age have left the city to work in Russia or neighboring Kazakhstan. Farida and her husband, despite a very difficult economic condition and poor job opportunities, have decided to stay in the city. At this moment her husband earns his family\u2019s living by working as a taxi driver. Farida owns a pavilion. She trades in vegetables and different kinds of foodstuffs. Trading in the pavilion brings her a monthly income of $230. During her twenty years of selling vegetables, Farida has been able to buy a flat and a car. At this moment she needs a loan to purchase foodstuffs and vegetables. Farida lives with her family in a detached house and some of her future plans are to make a repair at her house, buy new furniture and put up new gates. \r\n<p>\r\nThe following people are Farida\u2019s partners:\r\n<p>\r\nAlymkan is fifty-two. Her husband is a taxi driver. Alymkan would happily stay at home and be a housewife; however, working as a taxi driver brings her husband only $140, so Alymkan decided to help her husband by selling patties.  Alymkan needs a loan to increase the turnover.\r\n<p>\r\nElmira is thirty-four. She has two daughters, both of whom go to school. Her husband provides welding services. Elmira is engaged in a furniture business. She purchases old furniture, repairs it, and resells it at market. This business brings her $185 a month.

Immaculate is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kalisizo in the Masaka area of Uganda. She is married and has no children. Immaculate has a business selling bunches of bananas to the townspeople of Kalisizo.\r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Immaculate is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy 30 or more bunches of bananas, which she then hopes to sell in the market.  Immaculate hopes to generate profit from selling bananas to enable her to develop her business and sell other types of goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":559093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

They have four children aged between twelve and six years old and they hope to give their children a good education through the university level. His business is located in Kakamega. Kakamega is the region in Kenya known for production of sugar cane. It is widely known as the \"sugar belt region.\" He has a motorcycle, which he uses for transport to serve the local people. Besides this business, Kenneth owns a retail shop in which he sells general items. He has been in this business for the last eight years. He says that this business is profitable and his major challenge is that there are many other people in the area doing the same kind of business he is doing, so customers are not loyal, as they have plenty of choices.

The love and devotion for her loved ones make her a better mother, wife, and businesswoman.  With this attitude she and her husband were able to achieve their goal of having their own house.  During her years of economic hardship she had to travel around selling sweets to children, who were her main customers.  She did that until, with time and by virtue of her own character, she found favor with the people who tended to see her every morning in the doorways of schools and various locales.  Now she sees them on the corner at the city traffic circle, where, thanks to being granted permission by the local government, she has succeeded in setting up shop; she did have to buy a wooden display stand, which she's been using for six years.  Elvira hopes that doing this will give her the opportunity to satisfy her desire to have her own business in her house, which she's been setting up for all these years, so she can move right in with her products.  In the meantime, she's very happy selling sweets at her district traffic circle.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Elvira's 6th loan with MFP.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

(0) is a 22-year-old woman living in the town of Mulivai, Safata. She is single and has one infant child.\r\n\r\nTolotea owns and operates a business raising crops, primarily planting and harvesting bananas for sale. She has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 320 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tolotea joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.\r\n\r\nTolotea is now requesting a new loan of 1,250 WST which will again be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. The loan will be her 3rd from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He is 44 years old, married and has 4 children between the ages of 5 and 16.  His children go to school in Boane.  He attended college to become a Portuguese language teacher.  Other than his children, he does not support any other family members.  He grew up with his parents in Moamba and he often went to work with his parents, who worked for a public company in Mozambique.  Jorge works for the Mozambique government, carrying out his functions as a teacher in the Boane school district.  He earns 24.000,00MT each month that allows him to support his family, pay for a helper around the house, and pay for his children\u2019s schooling.  He lives in his own home and his wife does not work, as she suffers from a chronic illness.  Jorge already had a loan with a commercial bank (BIM) to build a retaining wall near his home.  After he was finished, he approached Hluvuku-Adsema for a loan of 20.000,00MT to purchase materials for a adding bricks to the exterior of his home.  He prefers Hluvuku-Adsema because they offer a lower interest rate and a flexible repayment schedule.  He pledges to repay the loan without problems in order to qualify for more loans in the future.  His goal is to purchase a vehicle for personal transport.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Rachel Crouch, Kiva

She works each and every day to get ahead in her business since, for her, it is very gratifying to live in a county as beautiful as San Vicente.  However, she knows everything isn\u2019t fantasy and that it\u2019s a scientific fact that she has to work hard to help her children get ahead. They are young, and still need the strength and support of their parents.  She sells shoes and her husband sells pans and knives in other areas of the country.  Carmen buys shoes for the business and sells them on credit.  Somehow, this way of working generates income.  She travels door to door to visit customers, and charges on a weekly basis.  Her shoes start at $10; she has been working only a few months.\r\n\r\nCarmen has been married for 5 years and, given how young her children still are, it has often been difficult to carry out her work.  However, her mother has been a great help by caring for the kids while she works.  They live with her in-laws, and she hopes to have her own house one day.  She hopes to use part of the loan to buy merchandise, and share the other part with her husband.  She buys different styles of shoes, which her sister helps her choose from the merchandise available.  \r\n\r\nCarmen buys three-dozen pairs of shoes each month, which the distributor delivers directly to her home.  She places her order based on customer demand, selling her shoes each morning and charging customers on Sundays.  She has not had any problems with customers, as they all are punctual with their payments.  Once she collects the funds, she places another order.  Falling in love is what led Carmen to relocate until she got engaged.    \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":533384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase shoes for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-05T11:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Anabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709105},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892403},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632765},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846799}],"funded_date":"2010-05-05T13:41:34Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":201894,"name":"Gary Alejandro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El joven Gary Alejandro R.

She started her own private business in 2005 by selling a variety of fruits. In 2009, she began to operate a clothing trading business and has since built a stable operation.

Miriam tells us that she has always enjoyed working and that, when they got married, she and her husband decided to open a business so that they could earn a little extra money and offer their family a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nMiriam tells us that, as her husband knows how to make bread, they opened a bakery.

This way they can save money on shipping costs as well as the P. item cost.  Those who don\u2019t weave or sell products have businesses buying and selling corn and beans, two staple foods of the region.  They travel to Santiago D.

For twenty years, she has worked in the business of selling handicrafts as souvenirs and typical clothing from the area for tourists.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes,  is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and to a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Arhangai province, one of Mongolia's central provinces. His children's ages range from 19 to 26. Oyunchimeg is a very entrepreneurial woman. Since 1992, she has been involved in many types of small business. Her first business was importing cheap clothes from Ereen, China, a border town from where many cheap Chinese products are imported. Since 2004, she has been selling cut wood to local carpenters. Within five years, she expanded the business, with her business capital increasing from 1,000,000 MNT to 3,400,000 MNT. \r\n<p>\r\nNow Oyunchimeg would like to open a small internet cafe to offer internet services and computer games to local people. She sees a great market opportunity as many local young people are really getting into internet surfing and computer games. She is committed to making the internet cafe a success as her private businesses are the sole source of family income. All of her children are top students at their respective high schools, and Oyunchimeg wants to make sure that they all continue their studies at the universities of their choice and pursue their dreams. She says that she works very hard to make all this come true. \r\n<p>\r\nOyunchimeg is requesting a loan to purchase computers and internet access for her new internet

She is 31 years old, divorced, and lives happily with her two daughters \u2013 Francesca (age 14) and Yurubi (age 4).\r\n<p> \r\nEvery day Carmen wakes up early to care for her two young daughters, who provide her with a reason for living and are the objects of her adoration.  Afterwards, she must quickly prepare meals for her patrons who purchase the rich and diverse dishes she offers on a daily basis.  She fulfills any request without objection, because her customers also ask her to deliver meals to neighbors, acquaintances, or friends.  Her dishes are in high demand.  Carmen\u2019s ability to create a new dish every day was something she learned from her mother.  Even though she keeps her recipes a secret, she manages to satisfy her customers by providing flavorful dishes and selling them at a low price.\r\n<p>\r\nSince she offers a different dish every day of the week, her business has grown rapidly and continues to generate good earnings.  Her daughters help out in their spare time, but Carmen prefers that they focus on their studies so that they can pursue a profession, an opportunity that she did not have.  Her ex-husband provides financial support in raising her daughters.  Carmen hopes to manage her own restaurant in the future.\r\n<p>\r\nEven though she is taking her ninth loan with MFP, Carmen once again promises to be punctual and make her payments on time.  She hopes to continue growing and succeeding.  She is happy to be working with her Communal Bank because the other women in her group are fighters just like her.  With the money she is requesting, she will buy merchandise to restock her pantry so that she can continue preparing meals to sell.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":414948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase ingredients for preparing meals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-28T18:10:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.5,"local_amount":238.58,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":238.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843108},{"amount":170.06,"local_amount":485.89,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":486.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734686},{"amount":6.77,"local_amount":19.34,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":19.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124075},{"amount":96.86,"local_amount":276.75,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":277.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959757},{"amount":167.81,"local_amount":479.44,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":479.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717393}],"funded_date":"2009-10-28T19:37:13Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":152025,"name":"On's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is a small loan request for two borrowers.

Later, after she finishes her activities in the home, she has to work for the Municipality of Urcos in the public cleaning department where she cleans streets, plazas and parks in the city of Urcos.  She tells us that she has a small handicraft workshop where her daughter Rosmery works.  She has had this business for some years now, and it has gone very well, thanks to all of the effort she puts into her work.  She is a hardworking and enterprising mother who needs a loan to buy more material such as wool, fabrics, thread and leather to make more crafts.

She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Orepa has 6 years of experience in this business.  Orepa needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 355 tala or US $148 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Orepa joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Orepa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Orepa V. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

daughter.  Djumabay was born in 1969 into a simple farmer's family.  His father had a small farm, and since childhood, Djumabay helped his father with caring for the livestock and dreamed of having his own farm in the future.  In 1988, after finishing school, Djumabay went to serve in the army.  Upon his return to his native village in 1990, he studied to become a driver of agricultural machinery and was hired at the local collective farm as a tractor\/combine driver.  After some time, Djumabay got married and, using his salary, gradually purchased young livestock and grew clover and cereals; thus, expanding his farm.  His daughter was born in 2002, and Djumabay was able to buy his own house for his family in 2003.  Currently, thanks to Djumabay's persistence, his farm contains 3 dairy cows and 22 heads of sheep.  In order to further develop his business, Djumabay requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for the purchase of bulls for fattening up.  In the future, Djumabay plans to increase livestock headcount and dreams of buying an off-road vehicle.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":909297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chaldovar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-04T20:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djumabay","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":880},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":660},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":660}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":880,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":40075.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283072157},{"amount":660,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":30056.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095354},{"amount":660,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":30056.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754526}],"funded_date":"2011-12-19T18:12:46Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:19:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":357661,"name":"Luz Katherine","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Luz es una cliente nueva en la instituci\u00f3n vino por referencias de un familiar que tuvo un cr\u00e9dito en la instituci\u00f3n ya cancelado se dedica a la venta de comida en una pensi\u00f3n por un mercado el cr\u00e9dito esta destinado a la compra de sillas, mesas, vajillas un televisor de 21 pulgadas un aparato de radio y algunos utensilios para mejorar la calidad en el servicio y ampliar su negocio.

People like to eat them fresh and make fresh juices which is very healthy. She sells her crops in the central bazaar and her monthly income is 300 Azerbaijani manats (AZN). Raising crops takes a lot of strength and means working in the open air, which is very hard for women. Guldasta is a very strong woman and has the potential to work even harder to produce more crops.\r\n\r\nGuldasta needs additional capital to invest in seeds and fertilizers. This will allow her to improve the quality of the products she grows and increase monthly turnover. For this purpose, she applied for a 1000 AZN loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":955758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Agjabadi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2012-01-01T08:02:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Guldasta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":215.05,"local_amount":168.67,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":169.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257117535},{"amount":103.78,"local_amount":81.4,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":81.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263242645},{"amount":106.15,"local_amount":83.25,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269967629},{"amount":107.1,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":84.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276811700},{"amount":102.98,"local_amount":80.77,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-19T07:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":80.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283775372},{"amount":107.09,"local_amount":83.99,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":84.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286799877},{"amount":107.48,"local_amount":84.3,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-17T08:00:45Z","rounded_local_amount":84.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294278547},{"amount":94.34,"local_amount":73.99,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":74.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301331423},{"amount":106.42,"local_amount":83.47,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":83.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308088388},{"amount":224.61,"local_amount":176.16,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":176.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315322649}],"funded_date":"2012-01-06T16:48:19Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T11:20:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":382242,"name":"Karem Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Karem es una joven emprendedora, est\u00e1 estudiando Psicolog\u00eda, el pr\u00e9stamo ser\u00e1 usado para pagar el curso de titulaci\u00f3n de finalizaci\u00f3n de sus estudios, sus padres le apoyaran en al pago del cr\u00e9dito.

is a young clothing merchant from Nikopol, Ukraine on the beautiful Dnepro River. He started his small business when he was in his late 20\u2019s and gradually, though much hard work, he has been able to develop it into quite a successful enterprise. \r\n<p>\r\nVitali has the qualities it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur. Goal-oriented, hard-working and punctual, he is a natural business man. Funding from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d has been instrumental in helping Vitali build his business. His first loan was for $500 and since that time he has benefited from nine additional loans while establishing a great credit history.\r\n<p>\r\nHe has requested $1200 to add to his available working capital. The ability to purchase large quantities of inventory in bulk saves time and expense for merchants such as Vitali. He would like to buy a supply of men\u2019s sportswear and men\u2019s and women\u2019s jean clothing that will boost his inventory before the busy summer season. Vitali appreciates the availability of funding through Nadiya Ukraine. It allows him to take advantage of good opportunities and focus on growing his business so that he is able to adequately provide for himself and his

It is in this way that she has spent 20 years offering her photography services. She is very well-known because of her experience.

Soledad-Atl\u00e1ntico, inicia el d\u00eda moliendo carne bien sazonada y con la cual rellena una tripa natural prealistada, sometida a altas temperaturas, que amarra con un hilo de pita, para darle su singular forma de cadeneta; es as\u00ed como la prepara para la cocci\u00f3n y apertura de orificos, a fin de que posteriormente se recoja y quede lista para degustarla.  De esta manera Antonio, elabora un embutido artesanal, llamado \u201cButifarra\u201d t\u00edpico de Soledad \u2013Atl\u00e1ntico, donde la proliferaci\u00f3n de estas unidades artesanales ha ido disminuyendo, pues actualmente  ha sido copiado y forma parte de la l\u00ednea de producto de grandes empresas carnicas que son su m\u00e1xima competencia; aunque como lo expresa Antonio, a esas industrias no le queda este producto con el exquisito sabor coste\u00f1o y por eso su clientela sabe lo que come, lo prefieren y lo buscan en el municipio de Soledad, el cual se ha hecho famoso por este producto inspirador de t\u00edpicas y hermosas canciones compuestas por artistas de nuestra Regi\u00f3n Atlanticense e incluidas en \u00e1lbumes  \u201cJoyas de la M\u00fasica Colombiana\u201d.\n\nAntonio, lleg\u00f3 a Barranquilla, procedente de Pedraza-Bol\u00edvar su tierra natal, donde se dedicaba a labores del campo, pero su deseo de encontrar un mejor futuro hizo que se trasladara a la Capital del Atl\u00e1ntico; fue as\u00ed como trabaj\u00f3 en la venta de cocadas inicialmente y luego en una microempresa ubicada en el Municipio de soledad, dedicada a lo que hoy es su \u00fanico ingreso familiar \u201cla fabricaci\u00f3n y comercializaci\u00f3n de butifarreras\u201d, actividad con la que ha logrado darle educaci\u00f3n a sus hijos en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus esposa. Aunque \u00e9l, no estudi\u00f3, aprendi\u00f3 a firmar y a trabajar con amor, para educar a sus  3 hijos  pensando en que  estudiando construir\u00edan un mejor futuro, as\u00ed lleva 19 a\u00f1os vendiendo butifarra y su hija  menor, estudia en el Sena, una carrera t\u00e9cnica y tambi\u00e9n comercializa este producto. \n\nSu primer cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo, lo  hizo hace 17 a\u00f1os por valor de $30.000, cuando conform\u00f3 con cuatro amigos el grupo solidario  llamado \u201cLuz de Luz\u201d. Desde ese momento el popular Antonio, ha recibido 14 cr\u00e9ditos, gradualmente aumentados en la medida de expansi\u00f3n de su mercado; su capacidad de trabajo y deseo de superaci\u00f3n permitieron que  en el a\u00f1o 1995 comprara un lote, para construir lo que hoy es su vivienda, la cual ha ido levantando poco a poco, con el producto de su trabajo en la fabricaci\u00f3n de la exquisita y muy Caribe butifarra. \n\nAntonio, es un experto en captar la atenci\u00f3n de clientes en espacios de gran afluencia p\u00fablica, con su hija vende al detalle en sitios muy estrat\u00e9gicos y es bien conocido como una persona responsable y honesta. Su pr\u00f3ximo cr\u00e9dito por valor de  $1.300.000 lo utilizar\u00e1 para  comprar materias primas e  insumos,  especialmente, carne de res, cerdo y pollo, para incluir variedad en la elaboraci\u00f3n del producto y poder vender en volumen, apoy\u00e1ndose en los vecinos del barrio donde vive, quienes tambi\u00e9n se han convertido en vendedores de su producto en los picos de alta productividad y comercializaci\u00f3n.\n\nSu  pr\u00f3ximo desaf\u00edo es continuar con las mejoras de su vivienda, especialmente piso, ba\u00f1o y pintura, el dice que el apoyo de su familia en el manejo del negocio es fundamental para que todo esto suceda.\n\n","en":"Antonio Mu\u00f1os begins his day in the early morning at his home in the Villa del Carmen neighborhood of Soledad-Atl\u00e1ntico, grinding seasoned meat which he uses to stuff natural sausage casings.  He ties the casings with string to form links.  He prepares it for cooking and later enjoying.  This is how Antonio prepares a delicious sausage called \u201cButifarra,\u201d typical in Soledad-Atl\u00e1ntico, where these small operations are going away and their culinary arts have been copied by large meat processing plants, which give great completion.  Antonio says that these companies\u2019 products are not as tasty, so his customers seek him out in Soledad and he has become famous for his product, which has lead to lovely inspirational songs by artisans form the Atlanticense region.  These songs have been included in the album \u201cJoyas de la M\u00fasica Colombiana\u201d (Jewels of Columbian Music).\r\n\r\nAntonia arrived in Barranquilla from his native land in Pedraza-Bol\u00edvar where has worked in the fields, but his desire for a better life inspired him to move to Atl\u00e1ntico where he initially sold \u201ccocadas,\u201d (sweetened meat candy).  He later worked in a small factory in Soledad, which make butifarra.  This allowed him and his wife to provide for his three children\u2019s educations.  Although he did not receive a formal education, he learned to work and write so that he could educate his children because he believes that a good education will give them a better future.  He has been selling butifarra for 19 years.  His youngest daughter studies in el Sena and also sells his product.  He got his first loan for $30 through \u201cla Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo\u201d (The Santo Domingo Foundation) 17 years ago when he and four friends formed the group \u201cLuz de Luz\u201d (Light from Light).  Since then Antonio has received fourteen incrementally larger loans to expand his market.  His ability to work and desire to get ahead allowed him to buy a vacant lot in 1995. Little by little he built his home with the income he made from the sale of his delicious product.\r\n\r\nAntonio is an expert in attracting customers in wealthy areas.  He and his daughter sell in strategic locations and he is well known for being honest and responsible.  He will use the money from his next loan of $1,300 for supplies, especially beef, pork and chicken in order to offer greater variety and be able to sell in larger quantities and support his neighbors who also sell his product during the high season.  His next challenge is to continue improving his home, particularly the floors, bathroom and painting.  He says that his family\u2019s support in managing his business is important to seeing this through.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva

The members defined themselves as hard-working women who fight for their dreams to come true. They organized and formed this group for this very reason, so they could reach their goals. One of the members is Librada. She is 21 years old, has two children under school age, and makes a living selling all kinds of clothing. She says that she sacrifices all of her days for her children to assure them a dignified and decent life.
