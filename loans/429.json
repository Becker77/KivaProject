","en":"Guillermina, age 48, lives with her husband and their 2 younger children.  Their eldest child is already married.  Her house is located in a crowded neighborhood in the south of the city.\r\n<p>\r\nPreviously, she was employed as a seamstress, but it was very exhausting work, and required her to neglect her children. She left her seamstress job 6 years ago and began embroidering sweaters.  Since then she has applied embroidery to all the sweaters that are brought to her, and when they are finished they are exported to other countries.  She likes this work a lot since she is able to work in the quiet of her home and, in addition, is paid a set price for each garment depending on the complexity of the design that she embroiders and the amount of work required.  For this reason she prefers to accomplish as much embroidery as possible.\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to get ahead, her wish is to supply herself with a large quantity of wool in order to be able to weave and apply embroidery consistently.  She believes that in that way her earnings will be better.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP, and she promises to be punctual with the payment of each one of her installments.  Guillermina is planning on investing the loan applied for in the purchase of different types of wool with which she will be able to apply embroidery to sweaters more easily.  In this way she hopes to be able to deliver sweaters on time. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":508717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"She will purchase wool in order to continue embroidering.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-18T16:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":504.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993379},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:03Z","rounded_local_amount":504.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718177},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":504.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751852},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":504.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934312},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":504.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673084},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":504.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886911}],"funded_date":"2010-03-18T23:13:06Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rick & Pat Brown","image":null}},{"id":190023,"name":"La Inmaculada Concepcion Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Filomena tiene una tienda en su casa que le permite mantener a sus 3 hijos, aperturo su negocio hace varios a\u00f1os cuando atraves\u00f3 algunos problemas, L. ventaja que elL. tiene es que pueD. coger algunos productos D. su tienda para preparar sus  alimentos, por otro lado L. desventaja que tiene es que con las ventas obtiene menos ganancia aun as\u00ed elL. es optimista y tiene muchas ganas D. salir adelante es por eso que el grupo L. escogi\u00f3 como presidenta\nGuadalupe apoya a su esposo con L. venta D. gelatinas, chupetes y gaseosas, con los pocos ingresos pueD. aportar con los gastos en casa, el pr\u00e9stamo recibido lo invertir\u00e1 en comprar m\u00e1s productos para L. preparaci\u00f3n D. los mismos, algo que le preocupa es que los productos han subido sus costos y tendr\u00e1 que invertir m\u00e1s D. lo proyectado.

D. C., age 52, lives in San Juan Opico, located in the department of La Libertad. She lives with her husband, age 67, who works as a farmer. She also lives with her two daughters who are grown; one works as a maid, and the younger works with her mother in the business. Juana makes breakfasts, drinks and pupusas [a thick corn tortilla stuffed with cheese, fried pork rind, chicken, or refried beans]. She also makes lunches. Her location is very good, since it is in a location called El Triangulo (\"The Triangle\"), which is in front of the road to Santa Ana and the main road of San Salvador. This is a well-frequented area, since in the vicinity there are several factories and plants. It is also a meeting point for people who are going to Quezaltepeque, Santa Ana, San Salvador and Opico; many of these people stop to eat before their work or long trips, so Juana has very good sales every day.\r\nShe is requesting a loan to invest in her food sales, purchasing all of the necessary staples for making more food.

Villamor is requesting a new loan of 19,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Villamor from ASKI.

In a contemporary world we cannot imagine life without a cell phone, computer or TV. The cell phone usage in Kyrgyzstan has risen dramatically in the recent five years. Almost every person right now has at least one cell phone. This growing consumption has caused the cell phone industry to grow very rapidly.\r\n\r\nRuslan N. is a part of this industry too. He is 21 years old and lives in a small Northern town, Karabalta. Ruslan has been selling mobile phones by retail since his teenage years. He spent 100,000 soms for his business start-up, and is earning 30,000 soms a month. Given a piece of advice from his mother, he took a loan from a bank, and repaid it successfully. Ruslan is married, and his spouse is an office manager for a local medical college. This couple has worked hard, and it has given them fruits. They have managed to broaden the business and purchase some furnishings. This loan is needed for adding cell phone accessories to his assortment of goods. The proceeds of business Ruslan plans to spend on a new automobile and maybe open his own store. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in \u201cCiudadela Metropolitana\u201d, a neighborhood located in the municipality of Soledad, where Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo is working to help develop the community. Maria Esperanza has her own business, which she started to provide additional household income. Before, the family depended completely on Maria Esperanza's husband. Through her business, Maria Esperanza is also able to support her children and prepare them for a successful future, something she and her husband both dream of. \r\n\r\nMaria's business activities include making custom women's clothing and selling various requested products. With her Kiva loan, which is her primary source of financing, Maria Esperanza will buy fabric, thread, and sewing supplies for her tailoring business. She currently has many orders from her customers, who want elegant clothing to wear for Mother's Day. She also has outstanding orders for perfume, underwear, and cosmetics that she will use the loan to buy.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to finish work on her home and to be able to set up her business in its own location, which will provide a better shopping experience for her customers and help her gain customer loyalty. Maria Esperanza's biggest challenge is accumulating enough working capital, something she has struggled with since she began her business. This prevents her from being able to take advantage of growth opportunities, which is why she works with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to overcome this challenge.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":755182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

She lives with her two children, ages 17 and 4, in her parents' home where her sister and nieces and nephews also live.  Rose sells beer, and every Monday she places an order through the distributors she works with.  She keeps the beer on ice so that customers can come to her house any time and get cold beer.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is 45 years old and the mother of five childrE.:  two of tH. are attending the local school while the others are still at home because they are young. Her husband, Mr. Aom Sreav, is a construction worker. Since her business is going well, she wants to expand it, so she decided to ask for a loan to buy more silk to weave. She hopes to increase her income to improve her living conditions. Mrs. Chhorn B. is the village bank president who has beE. selected by the members. \r\n<p>\r\nTwenty people, who all live in Kandal village in Takeo province, make up this village bank. The members will use their loans for different purposes. Eight members in this group have end-of-term loans (the rest have monthly payment loans). They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. \r\n<p>\r\nEnd-of-term loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. They allow tH. to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

She is a primary school teacher and has been working in an educational institution for 28 years. This, however, is not her only activity, because since she has been living alone, she decided to rent out the empty rooms in her house (for the last 8 months) and she has also been selling cosmetics and clothing for 10 years.  During her free time, she brings these products to various places to sell and it has gone very well.  What she likes about her work is keeping occupied and forgetting that she is alone, as well as the profit because she is on a fixed income.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that she has taken a loan through MFP.  She enjoys working with her communal bank because she has found companionship and responsibility among all the members.  With the money she is requesting, she will buy more beauty products and garments.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford, Kiva

Occidental. She earns her living by operating one  business venture: a charcoal and firewood sales business.  Her husband Rogelio, who is 55 years old, works as a truck driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are 20 to 32 years old.\r\n\r\n Erlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 which she intends to use to buy additional stock of charcoal and firewood to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\n Erlinda E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Urinboy is 39 years old and married with two children. Urinboy is dedicated to his agricultural business. Having little knowledge in the beginning, he had to learn a lot about farming and has now acquired fair experience in agriculture. Urinboy is very happy because his children are the motivation for his desire to develop his business. He approached IMON International to obtain a loan to buy more seeds and fertilizer to sow for a good harvest and to take care of his children and his home.   \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Grace has built a house for her family\u00a0 in this plot and has also put up 11 small semi-permanent rooms which she rents at USD 7 per room. Grace wants to build better rooms that can fetch USD 14.7. This means that her income will increase, thus she will have no difficulty in repaying her loan. To supplement her rental income, she has rented a two acre farm where she grows Maize, beans and peas. She sells the produce at Soko Mjinga market in Rongai assisted by her two daughters.

For now, he's living with his in-laws.  He's worked in farming since he was a boy.  His father died when he was 13 and he's supported his mother since by working in the fields.  Since starting his own family, he works for his mother part of the time and for his own family part of the time.  The happiest days for him are market days because he can sell the potatoes that he grows and collect the money that he's earned.  He then returns to plant again.  The rest of his time is spent growing, harvesting and sorting potatoes.  He would like to rent a space in the main market.  He says that it would be very profitable because he would sell directly, without resellers. Wholesalers pay what they want rather than the prices agreed on in the market.  This is Alberto's ninth loan from Microfinanzas Prisma and he's repaid all of the loans on time.  With this loan, he will pay in advance for a market space and buy fertilizer that he needs for his potato fields.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":236644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Market stall rental and fertilizer for farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-13T02:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":618.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989349},{"amount":300,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":927.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210674}],"funded_date":"2008-12-13T20:38:30Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":82684,"name":"Justina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Making fufu (porridge) from cassava is one trade that is lucrative for Justina A..

Ninety percent of the clothes she sells are sewn by her husband. Her husband used to work at a clothing factory as a cutter and tailor. In 2000, her husband was laid off because of adverse conditions with the business. Nyamjanyan had had her own clothing business since 1996 -- buying clothes at the Chinese border city of Ereen and reselling them at a local market -- but in 2000, they began to run a family clothing business together. Nyamjanyan's husband sews men's suits and topcoats, and she irons and sells them. He sews and she irons 2-3 items per day. The average cost of each suit and coat is MNT 20,000-30,000 (USD $13-20), and they resell them for an average price of MNT 35,000-60,000 ($25-40 USD). When Nyamjamyan took her first loan, her family lived in a \"ger\" (a traditional nomadic Mongolian home) on a plot of land the family owns. She has one daughter, who goes to elementary school. From their business profits, they built a house to live in.

in the village of Brgy. Cervantes, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. At 29 years old, she is a young entrepreneur who is proving that it is possible to break the cycle of poverty if you just give it your best shot. She started her business from nothing and now she knows that she has found the right path to achieving her hopes and dreams - to have her own fishing boat and save enough for her children's future. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore she started her business, Geraldine's husband worked as a helper at a construction site, earning the minimum daily wage, which was not nearly enough to meet the needs of their family. At the time, Geraldine was herself unemployed, and was totally dependent on her husband's take home pay, which he turned over to her so that she could budget for their expenses. That was fine while it was just them, but when she became pregnant with her first child, she realized that if she did not take the initiative, her children might grow up to be construction workers just like their father, or unemployed like her, and continue to be poor.\r\n<p>\r\nThis realization motivated her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 to access the much needed capital to start her own business.  She used her first loan to buy basic fishing equipment and went to work. At times, when her husband had no construction work, they both went fishing. The income was good and she was able to save enough to purchase a motorized boat and employ a helper. Aside from her fishing business, she was also able to start raising pigs. She earns an average monthly net income of 3,000 pesos from her ventures. Her previous loan of 7,000 pesos was used as additional capital for her business, and was paid in full on time. She is now borrowing 9,000 pesos on her eighth loan cycle from NWTF-Project Dungganon to add capital to her pig-raising business. She intends to save her earnings for the future security of her children.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable. This is Project

She is 59 years old. Lydia is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Lydia operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for her business comes from selling soft drinks and energy drinks in the local community. Lydia has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Lydia joined HSPFI, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lydia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used  to purchase additional inventory and working capital. \r\n\r\nLydia is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Lydia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":541667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

The most important thing is not to slack off and be lazy. For hardworking, ambitious people there are lots of opportunities waiting for them. One has to just see it and grab it outright. This is the distinguishing trait of a successful individual: to see the chance and do his best to use it. And chances and opportunities are always there. Nurgul A. is the leader of this group. She is 42 and has three children. Her husband is a builder. To make a living, Nurgul also works.  She is a saleswoman. She trades in meat. She started working after her husband had gone to Russia to work. She needed money and instead of asking her relatives for help, decided to try being a seller and it did work out. Now, her work allows her to not only meet her family\u2019s daily needs but also pay for her daughter\u2019s education. Nurgul has applied for this loan to buy five sheep for feeding and resale. \r\n\r\nNurgul\u2019s partners: \r\n\r\nMirlan T., 23, is single. He has decided to start his own business breeding cattle.

T. (12) is a 50- year-old femaL. living in the town of Hoang Hoa.  Lien is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  WhiL. each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsibL. for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 0305014-Dai Long-Hoang Thanh (0305014-Dai Long-Hoang Thanh).\r\n\r\n\r\nLien is married and has four adult children.  To make a living, Lien operates a family member's business harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community.  Lien has been engaged in this business for over 20 years and earns approximately 3,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Lien joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lien has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND, which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the seventh loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Lien plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  L. T.

She has two children who still depend on her, and lives in the El Cortijo sector of the Trujillo province.  <p> \r\n\r\nLuz started in the business of selling juices by traveling throughout the city.  Subsequently, with the credit she received from Manuela Ramos, she added a display case in her house for cakes and bread.  With both her savings, as well as later loans, she has outfitted her small store.  She now has a well-stocked store in her home, and she continues with her sales of juices.  She no longer travels around to sell her goods, but is instead able to do so from her own home.  <p> \r\n\r\nShe is a founding member of the collective bank \u201cLuz Divina\u201d (\u201cDivine Light\u201d) where she obtained her first loan of 300 soles (Peruvian currency).  With the loan of 750 soles (approximately $275USD), to be repaid over six months, she will buy sodas, fruit and beer to sell in her store.  Given that it is the summer season now, these products are in great demand.  <p> \r\n\r\nLuz is very happy with what she has achieved, having initially suffered greatly at the hand of her husband.

She lives with her partner and her two children in her parent's house. Working the earth is part of her life, her only source of income, and an activity she carries out with her husband. Yesi has a baby that she must take care of, for whom she feels very sad when her baby cries while she is carrying out her work in the small farm, carrying him on her back. And as a mother she feels very helpless since she can't offer her little one any comfort, since if Yesi does not work in the field, her husband alone does not make progress with the work. Now they are planting potatoes in the land that her father loaned them, and her harvests have been very profitable, and for this she feels very happy. With this type of work, her parents are comfortable, and she hopes to reach this too, for the well-being of her family. For this, first she would like to purchase her parent's small farms to have her own land to cultivate. Yesi is a quiet woman, but she is very responsible in making her payments.

He has been working in agriculture since he was a child helping on his parents' farm.\r\n\r\nFreddy plans on using the loan from CIDRE to buy fertilizer as well as seeds for growing potatoes, corn, and parsley.

This way, he can sell to customers who come to the market in the morning looking for fresh herbs.\r\n\r\nFreddy hopes the loan will help him to increase his earnings so that he can build a better home for his family, as the one they live in now is simple and small. He also hopes to continue taking care of his elderly mother, whose health has been deteriorating.

Ph\u1ed1 is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 06. \u0110\u00f4ng H\u1ea3i (16.02.06).\r\n<p>\r\nPh\u1ed1 is married and has one adult-aged child.  To making a living, Ph\u1ed1 owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale.  Ph\u1ed1 has been engaged in this business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3000000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2004, Ph\u1ed1 joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ph\u1ed1 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3079800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock.  She is now requesting a new loan of 4248000 VND, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and then sell.  The loan will be the 8th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Ph\u1ed1 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n<p>\r\n1.  N.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   Food Vending (bananaque),  a general store and e-loading. Her husband, Francisco T., who is 46 years old, works as an electrician to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 5 and 16 years old. Ma. Lina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Lina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 21,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing 19,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for the general store and bananaque (fried banana on a stick) so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Ma. Lina T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

The couple has five dependent children, four of which are their own children. About nine years ago, the family moved to H\u00eadomey in the town of Abomey Calavi. Genevieve helps her husband to provide for the family. \r\n\r\nGenevieve did not attend school. To meet the family\u2019s expenses, she prepares dishes (beans with cassava flour) that she sells from her home. As a sideline, Genevieve also sells liquor. She gets her stocks in Dantokpa, the international market of Benin, and also in Adja, located in Mono. Genevieve has been in this business for five years and has already obtained two loans, which were fully repaid. \r\n\r\nWith customer demand increasing steadily, Genevieve wishes to stock up on supplies and expand her business. This is why she is seeking a third loan. In the future, she would also like to sell bags of beans. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: food vending (barbeque); and buying and selling frozen products. Her husband Ernesto J., who is 45 years old, works as a multi-cab driver to earn his living. They have 4 children who are 5 to 22 years old. \r\n<p>\r\nAfricana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Africana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her to earn a monthly profit of PHP 24,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase more goods to sell so that she can continue to save for the future. Her priorities are to educate her children and to repair their house. Africana is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She started to develop this business after inheriting some of the livestock from her parents.  Burmabubu familiarized herself well with this trade since childhood and experienced no real difficulties with continuing the family business.  Her husband\u2019s specialty is a bit different.  He works as a physical education teacher at a secondary school.  Together, they raised five children.  The oldest daughter is thirty years old.  The youngest son is twenty-one.  Both of the daughters are married and live separately.  Two of the sons work in Bishkek, and one works for the police and lives with the parents.  All of the children and the husband help Burmabubu with the household business as much as possible.  Burmabubu\u2019s and her family\u2019s joint effort enabled them to build a big house and a barn.  The business that Burmabubu developed played a significant role in marrying off the daughters and also marrying the sons.  Burmabubu earns 1700 som ($40) per month just from milk sales.  Burmabubu\u2019s current main goal is to marry her youngest son.  However, she has to get well prepared for this by increasing the livestock headcount.  She decided to request a loan and purchase two calves for this purpose.\r\n<p>\r\nBurmabubu\u2019s group also includes Damira B., Ulbosyn A. and Darya K..\r\n<p>\r\nDamira B. is almost sixty years old.  Damira is a mother of six children.  Out of all the children, only the youngest daughter lives with the parents.  Damira is involved in animal husbandry, even though many people her age stay home and get cared for by their children.  Damira also sells milk, which allows her to fully provide for her daily needs.  Her income from milk sales is no more and no less than two thousand eight hundred som.  Damira needs a loan in order to purchase two rams.\r\n<p>\r\nUlbosyn A. is forty-seven years old.  Together with her husband, Ulbosyn is already involved in animal husbandry, sales of livestock and also sale of milk.  Their monthly income is about ten thousand som.  This is approximately one seventh of their original contribution.  Ulbosyn wants to obtain a loan and purchase four sheep.  In the future, she plans to breed sheep in a shed and use the income from sale of livestock to educate her daughter abroad.\r\n<p>\r\nDarya K. is forty-seven years old.  She raised three children.  Together with her sons, Darya breeds livestock and is involved in livestock sales, and also sells milk.  Thanks to animal husbandry, Darya raised her children without real difficulties and improved her quality of life.  She educated her children how to correctly take care of livestock and is slowly transitioning the business to them.  Darya decided to obtain a loan with the goal of purchasing four sheep for breeding.          <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":415976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy two calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karabalta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2009-10-28T18:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burmabubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ulbosyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Darya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":47000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6947},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":7279},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":7680},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":7955},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8376},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8763}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.59},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.36},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.74},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.18},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":162.59,"local_amount":6947,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":7080.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103838984},{"amount":170.36,"local_amount":7279,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":7419.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110730770},{"amount":179.74,"local_amount":7680,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":7827.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118121317},{"amount":186.18,"local_amount":7955,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":8108.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123956971},{"amount":196.04,"local_amount":8376,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8537.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989777},{"amount":205.09,"local_amount":8763,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":8931.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715589}],"funded_date":"2009-10-29T05:02:53Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":152504,"name":"Juliet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliet R. is from the village of Dullan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is a rural area, located \u00bd hour from the district of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor the past two years, she has dedicated herself to selling basic needs products and groceries from a store located in her house. The business is very busy, as it is the only one like it in the zone.  In addition, she raises and sells small livestock.  With the income she generates, she helps her husband cover the family\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nTeresa would like to expand her business by buying more groceries with which to supply her store and, therefore, increase her earnings.  For this reason, she has requested her first loan of 1,000 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa in order to meet her goal.  \r\n\r\nTeresa is a calm and responsible woman.  Her greatest wish is to continue to grow as an entrepreneur in order to improve her family\u2019s standard of living. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":619416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more groceries for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chacupe - La Victoria - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-10-20T19:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":68.9},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":71.2},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":74.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":74.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":80.08},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.98},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86.78},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.09},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":92.99},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":95.79},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":98.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.84},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.7},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.03},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.22},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.49},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.54},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.78},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.88},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.92},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.84,"local_amount":68.9,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":71.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177555178},{"amount":26.7,"local_amount":71.2,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":74.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530583},{"amount":27.94,"local_amount":74.5,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:54:06Z","rounded_local_amount":77.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666693},{"amount":27.88,"local_amount":74.35,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":77.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191410025},{"amount":30.03,"local_amount":80.08,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":83.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108454},{"amount":31.22,"local_amount":83.25,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":86.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270595},{"amount":31.49,"local_amount":83.98,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":87.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206137265},{"amount":173.9,"local_amount":463.74,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":484.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211209784}],"funded_date":"2010-10-21T00:14:12Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:59:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":243354,"name":"Magongola Zinunula Group-Mityana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"46 year old Robina N. who belongs to Magongolo Zinunula Omunaku group in Mityana has for the past 10 years been operating a bakery business in Magongolo, an up and coming trading center.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  making leather straps and a general store. \r\n\r\nFeliciana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Feliciana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 9,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly income of approximately $300, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her businesses and for the renovation of their house. \r\n\r\nFeliciana is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This group is represented by Cerrano Cruz, she has three children and works as an aesthetician. She is requesting this loan to buy beauty products for her salon such as hair dyes, bleaching dyes, curlers, and moisturizing creams, among other products. \r\n\r\nOther group members include Alejandrina L\u00f3pez M., who is 53 years old and married to Fernando D\u00edaz Nicol\u00e1s, who is a farmer. Alejandrina prepares homemade tortillas, tamales, sweet corn, squash, watermelon, and jicama. She sells about a third of what she prepares, and keeps the rest for her family's consumption. Alejandrina uses the maize and dried maize leaves (totomoztle) to make tamales. She sells all her products from a cart in front of her home and advertises her products through a car-mounted loudspeaker.   \r\n\r\nThis work has helped her family a lot, as she is able to feed and provide education for her children. Alejandrina says that despite farming many crops, she doesn't earn much from the harvest due to crop pests or too much rain. The family also consumes much of what is produced on the farm. Currently, Alejandrina's sales are good and she needs to buy some ingredients to continue making her food products. This is why she is requesting a loan to buy ingredients for making tortillas and tamales, such as whitewash (to coat the inside of the wood-burning oven), a tortilla pan, firewood, lard, chilies, onions, pork and chicken.\r\n\r\nThe following individuals are group members:\r\nCristina X Ram\u00edrez: Age 49, needs to purchase thread to embroider napkins that she sells.\r\nClaudina M.

This is her third loan with Afodenic which she wants to invest in fixing the ceiling of the room she lives in as it is quite deteriorated and she would like it to be in good condition to protect and care for her baby. Her objectives for the future are to be able to change jobs and improve her standing professionally and personally.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva

She has a small kiosk on the main street.  By buying 1,500 shillings worth of vegetables to resell, Rose can make between 250 and 500 shillings each day.  She averages between 10 and 15 customers each day, but the traffic at her small stand can fluctuate quite a bit.  Rose established her stand in 1997, and has never seen food prices rise as fast as they are now.  The added expense of purchasing her stock has pinched her profit margins.  That is on top of the struggles she faced during the post-election violence in Kenya in 2007.  Her small stand was burned and her entire stock of vegetables was destroyed.  However, two months later, she was back at it with a rebuilt business.  \r\n\r\nWith her loan, Rose would like to buy a bigger selection and a larger quantity of vegetables.  She would also like to start selling basic medicines and nutrients for sick members of her community.  She has two children, ages 14 and 8 months.  She takes her 8-month-old daughter to work with her since she doesn\u2019t have anyone to watch her during the day.\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development organization focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

She is a single mother of 3 daughters who are between 19 and 26 years old.  All of them go to school.  She studied through the 7th grade but was not able to finish due to a lack of financial resources.  She lives in government housing and supports her father, who lives in Zavala.  \r\n\r\nTeresa left Inhambane for Namaacha District on the border with Swaziland due to her father's transfer.  She has worked for the District government for more than 31 years and is also head of the town.  She earns 6,000 MZN each month, which she uses to pay for household expenses.  She is able to save some from time to time in her bank account.\r\n\r\nShe has never had loans with other banks.  This is her second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva; it has a value of 20,000 MZN, which she plans to use to buy construction material (cement, iron, etc.) in order to continue working on her house.

She earns her living by operating a general store and pig fattening business. Her husband Federico D., who is 48 years old, works as a carpenter and farmer to earn his living.  He also helps in his wife.  They have four children who are 17 to  21 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Elena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past seven cycle loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Elena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 to buy piglets and for additional capital so she can continue to save up for the future education of children.  Ma. Elena D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":559147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Additional working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Valladolid, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2010-07-13T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.
