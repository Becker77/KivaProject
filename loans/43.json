Luz has four children: her eldest son is 27 and self-employed; her second son is 26 and also self-employed; her third son is 24 and studying in his fourth year of high school because he is going to night school as he works at night; her daughter is 17.  Her husband works as a field foreman.  Luz's goal is to continue in business as she needs the income for her family to put bread on the table.  She wants to sell merchandise in bulk to satisfy her clients' demands.  She dreams of a better future for her country, with more employment for Nicaraguans and a stronger Nicaraguan economy.\r\n\r\nLuz has run a grocery for 5 years.  She began with a different line of business, selling refreshments and breakfast to the coppersmiths of the Monte Rosa sugar refinery: she would distribute the food daily and her husband helped by collecting the payments from her clients.  She later decided to make money for her family by starting a grocery and she now has the two businesses.  Her goal is to keep both businesses generating income for the family to live on.  She needs this loan for working capital to buy staples such as grains, chicken, cream and cheese as she has to stock her grocery to offer her clients what they need.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":252919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-11T04:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":675.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858721},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":675.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399970},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":675.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091968},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":675.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985352},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":675.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445968},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":675.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956609},{"amount":170.46,"local_amount":3181.84,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3378.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174037}],"funded_date":"2009-01-11T16:06:15Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":87076,"name":"Shirley","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shirley J. is 50 years old, married, and lives in Obay, Polanco Zamboamga del Norte.

Now, from selling milk and trading in cattle, Anarkul makes $115 a month.\r\n\r\nAnarkul and her husband have many plans about increasing the total population of their livestock. Now, Anarkul hopes to get this loan as it would enable her to buy two calves to raise and sell. They need to earn extra money so that they can pay for their daughter\u2019s college education, as she is graduating from high school this academic year.\r\n\r\nAnarkul\u2019s partners are:\r\n\r\nVenera, 38, has three children. To support her family her husband works as a taxi-driver. Besides that, Venera keeps two calves and works as a logistics manager\u2019s assistant.

Her husband works as a training officer in a vocational school and Gulnara works as a doctor at the same school. After work she sells apples and keeps two calves. Gulnara needs this loan to purchase three sheep for breeding. \r\n\r\nAnarkul, 44, is divorced and has one son, 25, who works as a builder in a resort. Anarkul keeps a calf, which she is going to sell after raising it. As to her regular job, she is a cook at the vocational school.

On a monthly basis, Ingrid travels by bus to San Jose in order to purchase clothing. When she returns to her community she sells the clothes she has purchased and earns a profit.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the income Ingrid generates from sales, combined with her husband\u2019s salary (he works as a laborer on a banana plantation), does not provide enough money to finance family expenses; as a result, Ingrid also works as a house cleaner in order to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nTo say that Ingrid is a hard worker is an understatement: in the mornings she carries out her duties as a domestic worker; in the afternoons, she works selling her products in her community; and whatever time she has left over is dedicated to her own domestic responsibilities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ingrid had a bad bike accident when a child\u2019s leg got stuck in her wheel; as a result, she had to take time of from her business in order to recover. Now she is healed and looks forward to dedicating herself to the success of her business.\r\n\r\nIngrid has successfully used previous loans to generate income from her business and used the revenues to make home improvements. This will be Ingrid\u2019s sixth loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. The loan consultant that has been working with Ingrid over the years describes her as a responsible, hard-working woman.\r\n\r\nIngrid plans to use this loan to make general investments in the expansion of her clothing sales business. Specifically, this loan will be used to purchase inventory clothing items and perfumes to sell in her community. \r\n\r\nIngrid\u2019s goal is to use the revenues she earns to improve her standard of living and that of her family. Specifically, she would like to make more home improvements and enable her children to have access to higher education.\r\n\r\nIngrid\u2019s business is successful in the sense that she has a large client base. The problem she faces is a lack of working capital. Ingrid hopes that this loan will enable her to satisfy the needs of her clients by bringing them the products they request.\r\n\r\nIngrid values her business because it provides revenues which are used to finance family expenses and to contribute to her savings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":509371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

At the same time, she will be able to generate more income that will allow her daughter to finish university and enable her son to build a home so that his family can live independently.     \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":576505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase bags, backpacks, and clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-07-30T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith Erlinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85292},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":91527},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":93281},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":95069},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":96891},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":98748},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100641},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":102570},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104536},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":106539},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":108581},{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":116325}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.52},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.49},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.51},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.71},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.81},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.2,"local_amount":85292,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":85511.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117144},{"amount":49.58,"local_amount":91527,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91762.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411013},{"amount":50.52,"local_amount":93281,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":93520.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550667},{"amount":51.5,"local_amount":95069,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":95313.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688273},{"amount":52.48,"local_amount":96891,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:07Z","rounded_local_amount":97140.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427502},{"amount":53.49,"local_amount":98748,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:16Z","rounded_local_amount":99001.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000915},{"amount":54.51,"local_amount":100641,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":100899.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288924},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":102570,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":102833.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157077},{"amount":114.33,"local_amount":211075,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":211617.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230088},{"amount":121.83,"local_amount":224906,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":225484.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673201}],"funded_date":"2010-07-30T19:29:35Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":223124,"name":"Sidi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sidi K. is 33 years old.

He has always been a very responsible father and worker. He has worked in the restaurant sector for a long time and his work has gotten the public's attention as he has always been attentive in learning how to prepare the different dishes that the restaurants offer. His goal has always been to have his own food business even though his family has discouraged him many times to not follow through with this project. He left his job and made his dream a reality by buying some equipment to start his business. He works in his home and every day brings him business. He has had much success with selling hamburgers, chicken wings, etc. What differentiates him from his competitors is the quality of his products and the good service he provides to his customers.

She has been doing poultry farming in Kitale town in Kenya and employs two farmhands, selling her eggs to the local market. \r\n\r\nHilder has requested a loan of 62,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

She has been in the communal bank for four years, and likes it because it helps her continue with her business and raise her child.\r\n\r\nTo support herself and her small child, she has a small business. Eight years ago, she put together all the resources she had, and fixed up a small shop  which she stocked as a small grocery store. \r\n\r\nFor her store, she bought all types of products, such as rice, sugar, cooking oils, detergents, etc. to sell to her customers. She works everyday from 6:30 am to 9:00pm, and sometimes later. She has had her shop for eight years and tells us that she has a lot of customers who make their daily purchases at her shop.\r\n\r\nShe is taking out another loan, and is going to use it to stock her store even more. She is going to buy stationery supplies, so that she can also sell these products. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that with the loans, her life has improved a lot. As she is separated, she has to see that her child lacks for nothing, and with her business, she is managing to do this. She earns enough to raise her child on her own, and doesn't have to neglect him, since her business is in her home, and she doesn't need to go out to earn money. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to keep moving forward with her business, and for her son to never lack for anything."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":868834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy stationery supplies to sell in her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-01-11T05:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yenny Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257183324},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263318999},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:51Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033821},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645900}],"funded_date":"2012-01-13T07:48:09Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":382974,"name":"Aline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aline aged 27.

Two of her four children have jobs--one is a cook and the other works for an NGO--and the remaining two work on her farm. Mrs. Non S. now faces an obstacle because she does not have enough money to buy rice seed or fertilizer.  She will use her portion of the loan to purchase them, enabling her to cultivate her field.

Ten members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

with his wife and their three children. Abass has owned a bakery for nine years. He does \u201csaj\u201dand \u201cmankoucheh\u201d. The \u201csaj\u201d is the metal oven where the saj bread is baked. A saj is a traditional Lebanese cooking dome used to make Markouk (\u201cthinned\u201d) bread and doughy confections or Mankoucheh. A mankoucheh looks like a folded pizza, the most common toppings being zaatar (thyme), jebneh (cheese) and lahm bi ajin (minced meat). You can eat it anytime of the day, but somehow it tastes better in the morning. Abass requested a loan of $2000 from Al Majmoua in order to purchase raw materials like oil, flour, thyme, cheese, coffee, and also a refrigerator. This is the first time that Abass has requested a loan. \r\nAbass is exceptional in his work because he does it well and his products are known for their good flavor.

for Business Development) is a cooperative of small-scale traders working in Thies, a city about 70km from Dakar.  The association was founded in 1993 by 20 entreprenurial women as a cooperative to increase their purchasing power and organize a tontine.  A tontine is a revolving group loan in which each member contributes a small amount to a daily fund, with a different member financed each day.  The tontine has evolved to more formal group loans through UIMCEC.  For such loans, the members are split into five-member groups, with a designated president and treasurer.  These sub-groups may be the same for many years, but often change members depending on financing needs and other considerations.  The AFDE organizes monthly member meetings and runs a cooperative for its members, allowing them to buy rice and other staples at a better price. The association's President is Ms. Mame Diarra Mar. \r\n \r\nMs. Penda N., 59, is the president of AFDE group No. 20.  Through the influence of her mother, she began selling in the markets almost 30 years ago.  She sells carrots, potatoes, onions and other vegetables.  She has eight children, all of them now adults.  Ms. Maimouna D. is the group's treasurer.  Her activity is traveling to the coastal town of Karay, some km away, to buy fish which in turn she sells in Thies.  Like Ms. N., she has been active in her trade for 30 years.  The other three members of the group are: Aminata D. who sells vegetables, Maty N. who has a small restaurant and Mame Fatou M. who sells fish.  Each recieves an amount of 100,000 FCFA to reinforce their activities.

D. M., 59, lives in San Miguel department with her husband, Carlos M. and their only son, who is 18 years old and a student.\r\n\r\nCristina has her own business, which is a grocery store.  She started her business wanting to improve her family\u2019s economy.  Her husband, with much effort, managed to launch the business.  It started off with few inventory items; it was all that their finances permitted.  Gradually, however, the business has grown but it still lacks many products.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Cristina has called upon Integral hoping to get a loan that will allow her to increase her stock inventory, above all with such products that are in highest demand in her location.  She does all this with the great desire to be able to improve her quality of life and to live in a more relaxed way with respect to family finances because profits earned are of great help to meet household expenses.  This then allows Carlos to be able to invest more in the education of their children.\r\n\r\nCristina is a very responsible and hard-working woman who is completely dedicated to her store and to her household chores.  She always takes care of her customers in the best way possible because, it\u2019s thanks to them, that she can obtain her earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan,

very hard-working.  He owns a bakery that he and his wife run; his nephews help him sell the bread throughout the city.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for his 11th loan, his 2nd with Kiva, to make improvements to his bakery. For example, repair the oven, columns and roof because with the rains they will get wet and become even more deteriorated and will prevent the bread from baking properly.\r\n\r\nHe states that the previous loan made it possible for him to consolidate his business because he was able to buy raw materials at a better price which led to higher profits.\r\n\r\nFrancisco\u2019s dream is to have a

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She resides with her husband and their children in a large traditional family in Sanoubougou I Kapel Kourou, an outlying district of Sikasso City (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). After several unsuccessful businesses, this woman became introduced, over ten years ago, to the business of buying and selling clothing and finery, such as Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), embroidered fabrics, handbags, necklaces, beads, etc. She buys her merchandise locally from wholesale merchants in Sikasso and then resells them from her spot at the neighborhood market where her goods are in high demand by her customers (composed essentially of housekeepers and condiment sellers at the market) for the quality of her items. \r\n\r\nConcerned about further satisfying her burgeoning customer base, Mahoua decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She is now on her first individual loan, which will be used to buy: 15 outfits of embroidered fabrics, 10 lengths of Wax <i>pagne<\/i> cloth, 10 handbags, and some women's necklaces. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mahoua envisions making a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the loan interest. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":843563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy clothing and finery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahoua","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":157.14,"local_amount":71428.58,"processed_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":72484.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882133},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":36242.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699228},{"amount":78.58,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":36242.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655495},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:58Z","rounded_local_amount":36242.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874288},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":36242.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283115},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":35714.26,"processed_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-09T08:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":36242.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424618}],"funded_date":"2011-09-03T13:17:15Z","paid_date":"2012-05-09T08:27:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":329694,"name":"Dzame","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dzame is a widow with seven children, all of whom have graduated from school.

Only one of them is still in their care because the others have already formed their own families.  She lives in her own house in San Luis D. Shuaro District.  \r\n\r\nSince she was a little girl, Luc\u00eda has worked in the fields.  She learned to work hard thanks to the influence of the Japanese people and of people native to her zone.  Luc\u00eda is an orphan and even though her life began far from relatives she can now enjoy a large family because her nine children have given her 33 grandchildren.  \u201cI feel happy and rewarded with my family,\u201d she mentions.  \r\n\r\nShe owns farmland where she grows coffee, bananas and avocadoes that produce good profits.  In addition, this sweet grandmother has a business selling groceries, clothes, kitchenware, shoes, etc.  This business has grown since Luc\u00eda started it when she was 19 years old.  \u201cIf I\u2019m lucky, I earn 120 soles daily and every two weeks I buy merchandise for my store; I\u2019m doing well,\u201d she explains.

She hopes to see her children and grandchildren happy; she supports them economically in face of any situation.\r\n\r\nThis will be MFP loan #5 for her so she commits to being punctual with her payments like she\u2019s been previously.

He has had his business selling bicycle parts for two years. Operating out of Lupida, a small town in western Kenya, Peter sells all types of parts, including tires, rims, breaks, spokes, and peddles. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the biggest obstacle he faces is a lack of capital. There is high demand for bicycle parts in the area because bicycles are the central form of transportation in the region. It is the main way that people move from town to town, from the farm to home, etc, and bicycles are even used as an integral form of commercial transportation. Called \u2018Boda bodas\u2019, young men put pads onto the back of their bikes and take people for rides for about 10 Kenya Schillings (1 USD is about 67 Ksh).\r\n\r\nAs it is, Peter receives 10-20 customers per day, and is able to collect a daily profit of about 150-200 Ksh. He hopes to receive a Kiva loan so that he can increase his supply of bicycle parts, and believes that with a loan, he can increase his profits to 300-400 Ksh per day. \r\n\r\nPeter\u2019s business helps him to provide for his two young children. He is able to give them the basic necessities, but in the near future he will have to start paying for school fees. While primary education is provided by the government in Kenya, families still face minor costs for uniforms and books. Moreover, when his children reach secondary school, he will have to pay much more substantial costs in order to educate them.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Diarra, age 21, lives at his father's house in the H\u00e9r\u00e9makono Centre neighborhood in Bougouni (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Mr. B. Diarra dropped out of school at an early age, to help his parents with their business. For years, Mr. B. Diarra bought and sold cereals at the Bougouni market, but this business was not successful. He thus decided to try another business, namely buying and selling spare parts and lubricants with his elder brother. Having two years of experience, Mr. B. Diarra masters his business and is well-renowned in this field, where he's doing well. He's seeking his first loan from Kiva's partner, Soro Yiriwaso, and intends to buy 20 boxes of 5 cans of motor oil, as well as small spare parts. He gets his supplies in Bamako, the capital of the Republic of Mali. With this loan, Mr. B. Diarra foresees turning a monthly profit of XOF 60'000 (ca US$ 120), which will enable him to expand his business and repay the loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann,

He has good references from both other businesses and friends. He greatly appreciates access to credit in this moment in order to promote the growth of his crops, and he is thankful for the lower cost product that he is able to obtain as a result of the Kiva funding.

Flordelisa is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Flordelisa from GDMPC.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale.  Ti\u1ec1n has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ti\u1ec1n joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

Ti\u1ec1n is now requesting a new loan of 9,184,000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  This will be the 5th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.

Desde el momento que ella se involucr\u00f3 m\u00e1s en la actividad notaron mejoras y aumento de clientela ya que lo que le corresponde realizar a do\u00f1a Yelba hasta el d\u00eda de hoy son las negociaciones, compra de materia prima y las giras para entregar la mercader\u00eda.La talabarter\u00eda tiene 20 a\u00f1os de funcionar y do\u00f1a Yelba participa activamente en ella desde hace 10 a\u00f1os. Necesita invertir el monto solicitado en la compra de materia prima ya que la \u00faltima inversi\u00f3n que se realizo fue para comprar una troqueladora Industrial que les facilitara el trabajo y para trabajar con mayor rapidez, porque los clientes demandan mayor cantidad de productos. Y la materia prima con la que cuentan es para confeccionar unos asientos que le solicitaron y no para los art\u00edculos de souvenirs que tanto vende.Este negocio de la talabarter\u00eda siempre ha sido de calidad y con un excelente acabado ya que cuentan con las m\u00e1quinas necesarias que logran ese acabado, sus productos son muy variados y siempre llevan un sello costarricense ya que reflejan nuestra cultura con su arte, confeccionan desde aretes, llaveros, monederos, bolsos, fajas, pulseras y dem\u00e1s productos de cuero. Estos productos los venden especialmente en los lugares tur\u00edsticos de Costa Rica.\nEn esta talabarter\u00eda los encargados de confeccionar los productos son el esposo de do\u00f1a Yelba y dos de sus hijos, en \u00e9poca alta como lo son estos meses contratan a dos vecinos nicarag\u00fcenses que ya cuentan con la suficiente experiencia para colaborar. Adem\u00e1s cuentan con contador que les lleva todas las cuentas cuando lo solicitan. Do\u00f1a Yelba agradece si se le apoya con rapidez ya que estos meses son los de mayor demanda y a\u00fan no cuenta con materia prima para confeccionar lo que le han solicitado.\n\n","en":"69-year old Sra. Yelba is well known in the community where she lives as she worked as a secretary in the town hall for 22 years. Because of her experience and years of dealing with judicial material, she was given criminal, controversial, and pension cases. As a result of a medical recommendation, she had to retire and return to a calmer life.\r\n\r\nAfter retiring, Yelba wanted to use the money she was given for something really important. She explained that her husband was going to quit the leather goods shop which had cost a lot to set up ten years earlier. Because of a lack of capital, he couldn't continue. So Yelba decided to spend her retirement money on machinery for the family leather goods store.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she became involved in the business, they observed improvements and an increase in customers. Now she runs the business, buys supplies, and delivers the products. The store has been running for twenty years, and Yelba has been involved for the last ten.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to buy supplies as the last loan was used to buy an industrial press to make the work easier and faster as customers were asking for a larger quantity of products.\r\n\r\nAs well, the materials they had were for seats and not for the souvenirs they sell so many of. Their merchandise has always been of high quality with fine finishings since they have the machines that do this work. They make a wide range of products which always carry a Costa Rican stamp reflecting the local culture and art. Among the products they make are leather ear rings, key rings, wallets, bags, belts, and bracelets.\r\nThe items are sold in tourist places in Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nIn this particular leather store the people who make the products are Yelba's husband and two of their children. In the high season two experienced Nicaraguan neighbors are hired. As well they have an accountant who deals with the finances. Sra. Yelba would be  grateful for a quick response to her request for a loan as this is the time of year when there is a high demand for their products. They do not have enough supplies on hand to fulfill the orders they have.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1733198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Souvenir

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Elle a 3 enfants. Elle \u00e9volue dans la vente de tissus d\u2019habits pour enfants et de petit d\u00e9jeuner .depuis plus de 20 ans. Elle a juste choisi cette activit\u00e9 pour gagner des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices  car mon mari a des revenus faibles par rapport  aux charges familiales. Elle sollicite un cr\u00e9dit  de 150 000 frs en vue  de renforcer son stock de tissus d\u2019habits pour enfants et acqu\u00e9rir  des chaussures pour diversifier ses marchandises. Ainsi  elle pourra r\u00e9pondre  a la forte demande de veille des f\u00eates de sa client\u00e8le.\r\nMadame M. est une b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du protocole entre U-IMCEC et le Programme de D\u00e9veloppement de l'Enfant et de la Famille (PDEF) Seydina Issa Laye.  Le PDEF cherche \u00e0 r\u00e9duire la pauvret\u00e9 au sein de la communaut\u00e9 et surtout \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les enfants issus des familles d\u00e9munies.  Gr\u00e2ce a cette coop\u00e9ration, les parentes de ces derniers peuvent profiter de cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 des conditions plus souples par rapport aux cr\u00e9dits ordinaires.  Depuis le d\u00e9marrage du protocole en D\u00e9cembre 2008, 120 parents ont re\u00e7u un financement pour des montants qui varient entre 50.000 et 150.000 frs<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French

She has 23 years old. She is a fruits seller to follow a season and her husband, Mr. Neat Kev, is a farmer who owns 1.3-hectare of land to cultivate rice to support his family living. This family has some problem because their rice field is infertile soil, it is far from irrigation system, and it has a lot of insects, but they did not have money to support it.

She lives and works in Dushanbe, manufacturing clothing and offering tailoring services. She is married, and her husband is very supportive of her business endeavors, which are her greatest hobby as well. All her products are very well sewn and relatively affordable, which is why Munira's goods are always in high demand. She has been in this business for 16 years and has learned some valuable lessons about overcoming challenges and hard times. Munira's business has another big advantage, as it provides jobs to other people, helping fight the unemployment rates which have always been a problem in Tajikistan. This time Munira is seeking a loan of 6,000 Somoni to purchase an embroidery machine and accessories to improve the quality of items she offers for sale and to facilitate some working procedures for her employees. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Eugenie and her husband take care of the various household expenses together. Eugenie ended her studies at the secondary level. For about fifteen years, she has sold various items (maize, beans, rice, canned goods, soap, etc.) at her store located in her home.

Ella se siente muy segura y supone una inversi\u00f3n exitosa, porque conoce esta actividad perfectamente, ha tenido la experiencia crediticia, siempre ha pagado puntualmente con la producci\u00f3n de sus hamacas y adicionalmente tiene el gran apoyo de su madre, quien trabaja con ella las artesan\u00edas. \nEn la actualidad Rosiris ha recibido 2 financiamiento de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, durante dos a\u00f1os; con  ellos logr\u00f3 comprar materiales para hacer hamacas y mochilas y tambi\u00e9n compr\u00f3 animales de especies menores, como cerdo y gallina y ella dice que cuando terminaba de pagarle  a la Fundaci\u00f3n, le quedaba un cerdo o dos, y sus gallinas de ganancia. Sus sue\u00f1os o metas  en cuanto al negocio es  capitalizarlo para tener m\u00e1s productos y en cuanto a su hogar, es  mejorar su vivienda y que sus hijos terminen sus estudios de secundaria y contin\u00faen carreras universitarias. Mientras Rosiris trabaja para lograr sus sue\u00f1os, genera un Margen de Contribuci\u00f3n  de 45.9%, una  Rotaci\u00f3n de Inventarios de  15 d\u00edas y una  Rotaci\u00f3n de cuentas por cobrar  de 1 d\u00eda, es decir todo lo que vende a cr\u00e9dito, se lo pagan al d\u00eda siguiente. Desde estos indicadores financieros proyectamos su crecimiento potencial y auguramos una inversi\u00f3n exitosa con su credikiva.\n\n","en":"Rosiris, 42, is a widow who lives in San Jacinto with her four children, ages six through 21.  Three of them study and the eldest works.  In a land where vertical weaving is an abundant craft, Rosiris earns a living making hammocks, bags and bands, which is a trade she learned as a family tradition.  When she became a widow she began to focus more on the activity.  During the day she makes hammocks and at night she makes bands to order earning 2,000 COP per band.  She makes a minimum of three per night. They live in their own house close to her mother and two siblings.  Her family is very supportive of Rosiris and ever since her husband passed away they have helped out raising the children.  And thankfully there is one son who works and contributes to the household expenses.\r\n\r\nThis is her first credikiva loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation and she plans to buy cotton yarn to increase production.  She is very sure that the investment will be successful because she is perfectly familiar with the business and has had loan experience.  She has always paid them back on time through her hammock production and she also has the support of her mother who helps her make the crafts.\r\n\r\nRosiris has received two loans through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation in the past two years.  With them she has been able to buy materials to make hammocks and back-packs, as well as small animals such as pigs and hens.  When she finished paying back the Foundation she still had a couple of pigs and hens as a profit.  Her goal is to capitalize her business so she can add more products.  She also wants to improve her house and insure her children finish their secondary education and get a university degree.  While Rosiris works toward her goal, she generates a contribution margin of 45.9%, an inventory turnover of 15 days and an accounts receivable turnover of one day, so what she sells on credit is paid the next day.  These are the financial indicators that we have used to project growth potential and we forecast a successful investment with her credikiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":866469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy cotton yarn to increase production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-10-03T08:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosiris Margoth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":550000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":46902},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50563},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":51743},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":52950},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":54186},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":55450},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":56744},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":58068},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":59423},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":63971}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.71},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.29},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.71,"local_amount":46902,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":50413.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614981},{"amount":29.88,"local_amount":50563,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-24T08:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":54348.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568918},{"amount":30.58,"local_amount":51743,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":55616.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780240},{"amount":31.29,"local_amount":52950,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":56914.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188633},{"amount":32.02,"local_amount":54186,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:31Z","rounded_local_amount":58242.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324845},{"amount":32.76,"local_amount":55450,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":59601.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038903},{"amount":67.85,"local_amount":114812,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:56:51Z","rounded_local_amount":123407.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140662},{"amount":35.11,"local_amount":59423,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":63871.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100575},{"amount":37.8,"local_amount":63971,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":68760.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338195}],"funded_date":"2011-10-03T13:09:06Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":342050,"name":"Rosa Edith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudadela Municipal  de la ciudad de Portoviejo, capital de Manab\u00ed conocida desde hace muchos a\u00f1os  como la ciudad de los reales tamarindos, se re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas  las socias del Banco Comunal Nueva Estrella Solidaria.\n\nEn este lugar conocimos a la se\u00f1ora Rosa, tiene 55 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen cuatro hijos, todos son mayores de edad e independientes aunque viven en su casa pero en departamentos independientes.

He is married with five children aged between 6 and 17 years, They all go to school. He is a farmer and he has been growing maize for the past 6 years. His wife is also a farmer. With the loan from Kiva, he would like to pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used to pay school fees of his children and to pay medical insurance.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.
