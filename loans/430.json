Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Most of its members are new, and live in the same neighborhood. They are very enthusiastic to work hard and take advantage of the opportunity offered to them in this loan cycle. There are about 5 returning group members who are taking out new loans. Some group members sell cosmetic products (Yanbal, Esika and Avon brands), one is a laundress, and others sell drinks and\/or food (lunch or dinner). There is a lot of competition in these fields, since every day more and more people are taking up informal commerce, but each group member makes a notable effort to pay off each loan installment on time. The group members will invest their loans in a variety of different things: those who sell cosmetics will use the money to fill their personal orders; one client will buy plastic tables and chairs for her small restaurant, and most of the remaining clients will invest the money in their respective businesses and jobs in order increase revenue. The returning group members have previous experience at other similar financial institutions, while others are taking out a group loan for the first time. Returning clients have been invited back due to their demonstrated commitment to paying off their loan installments on time and complying with Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital's standards.\n<br

His son is completely dependent upon Miguel.  They live together in Apopa.  \r\n\r\nHe is a very responsible man who works as a builder.  He has been doing this work for 30 years.  That makes him a complete expert at repairing different things.  Miguel very much wishes to get ahead and offer his family everything they need.\r\n\r\nThat is why he is requesting a loan from Integral.

BRAC and BRAC Uganda<\/b><br><br>\r\nBRAC (Building Resources Across Communities) is a development organization that began operations in Bangladesh as a small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education program."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":102340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

Sofia has used profits from her colmado (small corner store) to build this house, a significant achievement and proof of an expanding business. El Puerto is not an easy place to live: few medical facilities, large distances to nearest towns, little access to electricity, and no potable water access can cripple a population. Despite these difficulties, Sofia and her group have found stability in their loans and look forward to continuing to develop their businesses and community.\r\n\r\nSofia will be using this loan, her ninth with Esperanza International, to buy additional merchandise for her store, including bread, juices and soft drinks. She said that before having loans, it was easy for her and other group members to fail in their businesses because they did not have enough cash flow.

Janeth has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Janeth joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Janeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Janeth is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Janeth from HSPFI.

This made it possible for Burmabubu to build a house and contribute to the marriage of her daughters. With the loan, she will buy calves to increase the number of their cattle. In the future, Burmabubu plans to save money and contribute to her sons' weddings.\r\n\r\nDamira B. is 59 and is married. She has three sons and three daughters.

First and foremost, it means sacrificing nighttime sleep, doing without respite hours and not having enough time for family. That was the exact experience M. Dan went through before he called it quits and started his five-year-old business selling chapati (unleavened flatbread, similar to tortillas) in Amber Court Market in Jinja.\r\n\r\nFor this single 24-year-old, it was time to cast his mind to the future. Dan knew he had to extricate himself out of this problem. His decision to take up this business was based partly on the fascination Ugandans have with chapati rolled egg omelets and the fact that he needed to find a stable and more convincing livelihood. \r\n\r\nFor the last five years, Dan has shown resilience in stemming the tide of financial and other challenges to his fledgling business that have cropped up. His hard work has been paying dividends as he has been making profits close to 30,000 shillings a week. With his determination the future looks promising.\r\n\r\nDan is planning on expanding his business through the purchase of more bags of chapati baking flour with the assistance of this loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":550987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more bags of baking flour to make more chapatis","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Jinja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.583333 33.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-06-09T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Connie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedict","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":212500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":285.42,"local_amount":646950,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":650755.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662541},{"amount":370.83,"local_amount":840550,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:07Z","rounded_local_amount":845494.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689318},{"amount":463.48,"local_amount":1050550,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1056729.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903475},{"amount":380.27,"local_amount":861950,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":867020.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296950}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T20:17:37Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":210230,"name":"Gifty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gifty is very welcoming.

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ruffa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

Otherwise, demand normally plummets during planting season when many people consume more of their own green vegetables and less meat.\r\n\r\nWhat has made his business have an advantage during the aforementioned good seasons is the fact that he normally has lots of goats to sell. Through revenue from his side farming business, he is able to purchase more goats to add to what he already has. In this way, he can meet the heavy demands of clients.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Christopher is an optimist and a good planner is not only his winning calling card for now, but also is likely to be in the future.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Boys School Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These are teachers of the RC Boys School in Magburaka. R.C Boys is a primary school. It was founded in 1955 by the Catholic missionaries. Today, it has a total of 250 pupils with a staff of twelve teachers and administrators. This school is proud that they almost always earn a 98-100% pass rate on the National Primary School Exams (NPSE).\r\n\r\nRC Boys had never got a loan from SMT before.  They heard of SMT from colleagues in other schools who have benefited greatly from SMT\u2019s services. They decided to form a group and send in an application to SMT requesting a loan after hearing these other success stories. With the loan, some of the staff members will start a small business and those who are already run small businesses will invest the loan into their business. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children's education or pay for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in home building projects.  \r\n\r\nGovernment salaries are usually quite small for teachers, thus making teaching an unattractive profession for many whose primary motivator is money. Many choose other jobs over teaching because of the small salary, thus starving the field of qualified personnel to teach the children. The few who remain in the classroom have to find other ways of making ends meet. The vast majority of them engage in either business or agriculture or they provide extra tutorial classes for the children (although this is a practice the government is trying to stop). Needless to say, loans from SMT are a great help to the teachers in order to boost their businesses or invest it in something productive. Many want to go to school but could not afford the cost. Some will want to buy pieces of furniture, but their monthly salary is not enough to let them do so. With a loan, they will be able to meet some of these needs.  And with their monthly salaries, they can repay easily via a payroll deduction type of system.\r\n\r\nFifty-nine year old Augustine J. Kalokoh (back row, fourth from left) is the head teacher at the school.  He was born in Makali, only a few miles from Magburaka town. He is married with five children. One is in class three, one in junior secondary school III (JSS III) and three are in senior secondary school III (SSS III). Augustine will use his loan to purchase house building materials, specifically cement for bricks. In Magburaka town, where he will do this purchase, a bag of cement will cost him Le 36,000. Augustine will use the loan to buy as many bags of cements as the loan can offer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":235357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchasing house building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Magburaka, Tonkolili","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-12-07T11:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4400,"lender_count":132,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Augustine J.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry R.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brima ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zainab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zainab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacinta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Musa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamiel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Augustine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":13200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1320000},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1320000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":440,"local_amount":1320000,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1321320,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9968681},{"amount":172.5,"local_amount":517500,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:46Z","rounded_local_amount":518017.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885064},{"amount":1147.5,"local_amount":3442500,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3445942.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128906},{"amount":440,"local_amount":1320000,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1321320,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025695},{"amount":1475,"local_amount":4425000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4429425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008499},{"amount":285,"local_amount":855000,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":855855,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662613},{"amount":440,"local_amount":1320000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-17T10:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1321320,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102848}],"funded_date":"2008-12-09T02:45:14Z","paid_date":"2009-10-17T10:57:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":82392,"name":"Mencia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mencia tiene 43 a\u00f1os, es casada y vive con sus 4 hijos.

Her children are grown now and can take care of themselves so she has plenty of free time.  She started the business in February 2006, on the patio of her house, selling used clothes.  Later, a neighbor gave her the idea to buy bundles of used clothes which were selling very cheaply and quickly turn them around.  Things have been going well ever since.  Margarita's sales have increased bit by bit and she can now count on a good number of customers who buy used clothes brought from the United States.  She needs a MXN$7,000 loan that she will pay in 10 14-day installments.  She will use the money to buy bundles of used clothes appropriate for the coming spring and summer seasons so that she has a good supply for her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":224851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy merchandise for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tampico, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22.216667 -97.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2009-02-20T20:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T07:53:39Z","rounded_local_amount":731.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20350020},{"amount":50,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T08:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":731.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037295},{"amount":50,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":731.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037296},{"amount":50,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":731.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927708},{"amount":50,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":731.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927709},{"amount":50,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:43Z","rounded_local_amount":731.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382778},{"amount":50,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":731.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382779},{"amount":50,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":731.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889463},{"amount":50,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":731.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889464},{"amount":50,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:36Z","rounded_local_amount":731.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110979}],"funded_date":"2009-02-20T21:35:17Z","paid_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":94680,"name":"Juditha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juditha A. is a \"sari-sari\" store owner.

When she married, she and her husband had the idea to buy a car, so both joined their savings and acquired a second hand one, which they now work with offering a transport service for interstate cargo. Precisely at this moment their mobility is in another city.  \r\n\r\nIn this business Martha is charged with the administration of the profits and maintaining the car in a good state, trying to do mechanical inspections periodically. Her wish for the future is to acquire other cars to have a cargo transport fleet, now that this business is resulting in being profitable and in great demand. This is her 9th loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA. The continuance of her communal bank has permitted her to develop skills she was unaware of, which have blossomed with the support of her colleagues, who work in an organised way and with responsibility. The 2000 soles that she is requesting now are very important for her business, as she will now have the possibility to finish the total amount to acquire an additional car and increase her earnings. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":335874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Finish the amount neccesary to buy a car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-15T09:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":301.27},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":306.58},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":327.69},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":338.68},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":354.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":371.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.68},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.47},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.6},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.3},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":101.68,"local_amount":301.27,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:55Z","rounded_local_amount":305.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990775},{"amount":103.47,"local_amount":306.58,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":310.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211885},{"amount":110.6,"local_amount":327.69,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":332.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641412},{"amount":114.3,"local_amount":338.68,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":343.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080851},{"amount":119.62,"local_amount":354.44,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":359.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996992},{"amount":125.33,"local_amount":371.34,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":376.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842331}],"funded_date":"2009-06-17T06:49:22Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":119256,"name":"Altansuh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Altansuh D., 28, is a married father of one son.

Those who live there work mainly in the production of traditional textiles, embroidery, and wool yarn that is used to make clothing. Others work in agriculture and many have migrated to larger cities or out of the country searching for a better future for their families.\r\n\r\nMaria F. is one member of the Barrio Sucre Communal Bank. She lives on the outskirts of Cuenca in the parish of Cumbe. She is 40 years old and has been divorced for three years. Her marriage was broken up by another woman. With her husband she had three children who are now 17, 16 and 5 years old. Her older sons work in construction when there is work to be found. They contribute what little they earn to the household and to their younger sister\u2019s education. The house they live in is theirs, as it was the inheritance left to the children by their father.\r\n\r\nMaria works selling vegetables at the Feria Libre, a large market in Cuenca. She has been in this line of work since she was 12, as she used to help her mother with sales on Mondays, Saturdays and Sundays from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm. She keeps the same work hours today. Maria has been working with this little bank for two years and she tells us that it has helped her to increase the number of vegetables and fruits at her stand and offer her customers a variety of products. With the loan offered to her by FUNDACION ESPOIR [a Kiva Field Partner] she will buy tomatoes, onions, peas, carrots and other vegetables to stock her business.\r\n\r\nHer great dream is to get ahead along with her children and to give them a better future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":497489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, peas, carrots and some fruits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-02-28T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Maria Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:25Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946488},{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":64.17,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":64.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946489},{"amount":258.35,"local_amount":256.68,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":258.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708915},{"amount":193.76,"local_amount":192.51,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":193.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892210},{"amount":129.13,"local_amount":128.3,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:22Z","rounded_local_amount":129.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632618}],"funded_date":"2010-02-28T02:59:21Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

She is married to Angel P., and mother of three children, two of whom are enrolled in elementary while the oldest child is in high school. By the grace of God, Nena has managed to support her older child's schooling up to high school level. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send them all the way through college. A dream for most Filipino parents like Juanita, as she herself has been a college undergraduate, and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nNena operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php24,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nNena dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":590854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business is planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale.  Mainifo has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mainifo joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mainifo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1000 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise.  Mainifo is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the second loan Mainifo has taken out from SPBD.  Mainifo plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand the

Two of them still live at home and work.\r\n\r\nShe runs a grocery store in her house and also sells bazaar items and ice cream.  She works every day from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and also prepares and sells lunches.  She says considerable customers come for her delicious meals every day but weekends are when sales are at their highest.  She buys the products for her store in Manta.  Some are delivered to her store.  She has been in business for three years and it is going quite well.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy products such as rice, sugar, canned goods, detergent, meat, fish, etc., some of which are also used to prepare food.  She's been a member of the communal bank since it was founded, acting as its treasurer, and enjoys the group's close relationship.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have good health."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":745480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy rice, sugar, canned goods, detergent, meat, fish, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-04-08T08:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206152233},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":330,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211225065},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:05:27Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216503858},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221667801}],"funded_date":"2011-04-15T15:12:06Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:48:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":292203,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine is a 35-year-old, married woman.

high school. Cruz's business is a corner store, a business she has had since she was very young. According to her, she started her business when she observed that her husband's income was insufficient, and she tells us that it was very difficult at first because she had no idea how to start.  In a time in her life she was a pork butcher, which gave her an idea on what she was going to do, but butchering pork was only a once-a-week occurence, and she felt that the earnings were too small. Today her greatest need is to invest in her business through the pruchase of products for resale.  For this reason Cruz has been working with CEPRODEL for 4 years now and she feels very satisfied with the credit that has been granted to her.  She has secured higher income that has benefitted the improvement of her business and of her household. Her credit history show 18 past credits.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nCruz del Carmen D.

Her son attends secondary school and her mother is retired. Chimgee operates and manages a traditional shoe making business with her father. She makes two different types of traditional shoes, one called Buriad and the other is called Mongol. She started her business in 2006 and at that time only produced the Buriad shoes. As she began gaining more experience and customers, she expanded her product line to include the Mongol shoes. Through her hard work, she has been able to buy tools and rent a small work area. One day, she would like to own her own store where she can sell her products, expand her product line and also attract new customers. She is requesting a 1,000,000 tugrug (~700 USD) loan to purchase more supplies and tools for her shoe making

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<em>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<\/em><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Tausala's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nSPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nTausala's Overall Social Metric Score*:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She is 68 years old. Rosalia is the group leader of a 2-member group taking out a loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRosalia is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Rosalia raises livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Rosalia has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Rosalia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Rosalia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Rosalia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which she will use to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 18th loan taken out by Rosalia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She earns her living by operating food vending, BBQ and bakery businesses. Macaria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Macaria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, uplifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her eighth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her current businesses as well as enough capital to a open a new business so she can continue to save up for her family's future security. Macaria A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable').

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Tania is 32 years old, single and lives with her parents and brothers. Since she was a little girl she worked at different activities helping her parents. Among these activities she learned how to sell beer wholesale, and has been in this business for the last ten years. She feels very content with this business, since she has liked the trade business since she was little. Thanks to the lucrative aspect of this business, particularly thanks to the many community events that take place in her town, she can sell large quantities of beer at very good profit. In time she hopes to become a great distributor, or at least be well known in her circle. Tania is currently on her second loan with MFP, and she expects to continue to work as she has been, with great sense of responsibility and a good repayment record. With the money that she is requesting, she will buy more boxes of beer with which she hopes to increase her sales during the holidays.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Monica Hayden, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":251473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Incremento de la cantidad de bebidas que vende","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-08T16:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228323},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423555},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:09Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116818},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011748},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595343},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989574},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210754},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:03Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640384}],"funded_date":"2009-01-11T18:21:23Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Monica Hayden","image":170539}},{"id":86520,"name":"Ignacia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ignacia L. and her family are living a simple life in the village of San Manuel Naguillan, Isaebla.

Irma is twenty-five years old and is a single mother.  She works hard for the sake of her young daughter.  \r\n\r\nIrma has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for about five years and is a member of the communal bank \"Nuevas Amigas\" (New Friends).  Irma invested her first loan of 300 soles (about $100) in the business of selling beauty products.  This business partially financed her university studies. She plans to use this loan of 2500 soles to purchase undergarments and basic grocery products to sell in Masisea, where she works. Irma spends most of her time in Masisea but returns to Pucallpa at the end of every month to collect her teacher's salary.  \r\n\r\nIrma's goal is to design undergarments and to have her own boutique from which to sell them.  She is pleased to be working with Manuela Ramos because the organization gives loans without much bureaucracy and paperwork, unlike most other banks.

Ikhtiyor is a family man who wishes to increase his business to be able to better support his family and offer them a better quality of life. Eight years ago, Ikhtiyor started by selling blankets and counterpanes (bedspreads).  His business has grown little by little and now offers greater variety and fashions. Today, Ikhtiyor has been working with Kiva partner IMON International for more than three years and feels very satisfied with the support offered to him because it has allowed him to increase his business, satisfy the needs of his customers and support his family. Ikhtiyor is asking to borrow $1,500 USD in order to purchase new goods. He wants to develop his business and increase his income to save money and create a better life for his family. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives together with her husband in sector Angolo II, M\u00f3rrope district, located one hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Laura has worked raising animals for 14 years. She tells us that this is one of the most common activities of the zone, and is a great help in meeting the household costs, owing to the fact that the majority of men work in agriculture and this doesn't offer sufficient earnings.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Laura is conscious that she must continue to move forward and support her husband in maintaining their home. Because of this, one year ago she also installed a small grocery store in her home. These businesses are a great help to the family's economy.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Laura wants to expand her business by purchasing more animals, but doesn't have sufficient capital to realise this action. For this reason for the first time she saw a need to ask Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 2000 nuveos soles, which will permit her to achieve her objective.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Laura is a responsible woman, active and very hard-working.

He has owned his land for over 25 years, but he has lived in the rural area his whole life. Although he has a limited education, he has been able to be successful farming. He is seeking the loan in order to invest in rice now that the rainy season is making the land apt for cultivation. He has five children that he has been able to educate. Two of his children are making their way through college and Tirso wants to keep supporting them. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tirso is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming, plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despite its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention force.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worst when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, rice farmers lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":15496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Cultivate rice on his land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-02-20T04:59:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tirso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-09T00:07:30Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-04-25T14:52:28Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13835},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T18:37:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19607},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T13:52:55Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26597},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T15:56:05Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36147},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T23:25:19Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47470},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T16:14:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59562}],"funded_date":"2007-02-23T00:07:30Z","paid_date":"2007-09-27T16:14:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":8688,"name":"Khuraman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khuraman is local of the town of Beylagan.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education
