They have poor living conditions in the village and they both cultivate rice and corn as their main source of income.  <p>\r\n\r\nShe is now asking financial assistance amounting to PHP 4,000 that she will use to purchase feeds for her hogs.  She is hoping that in the coming months she will be able to add at least one or two hogs for her business to grow.  Joan said that through the lenders who provide her with financial support and with her hard work and faith in God, nothing is impossible in achieving her dreams.  Her investment in the business will also be of great help in sending her children to school in the coming year.

Working together like this has been their way of life for over 20 years. They recently started making and selling bread and plan to invest part of their loan to purchase flour in order to make more bread, which they will sell in their village. During the months leading up to Easter, bread sales increase significantly and the women think it would be a good idea to take advantage of this for their business.

She hopes that this business will grow further to be able to support the growing financial needs of her child until she graduates. \r\n<p>\r\nTwo of her children have their own families now and Selda is happy for that despite the fact that they were not able to graduate from college. She was financially incapacitated at that time to support their education; that\u2019s why she can\u2019t blame her children for their educational achievement. Nevertheless, they can manage their own lives now with their loving and supportive spouses.\r\n<p>\r\nPresently, Selda\u2019s business is growing and she has been able to acquire more customers. However, she oftentimes encounters a problem in meeting their demands. With that, she and her husband agreed to request a much larger loan which they will use to purchase their own motor fishing boat. \r\n<p>\r\nThe boat will be managed by her husband; therefore, aside from buying fish to sell from other fishermen in their village, she will have more fish to sell every time her husband goes fishing.

Jameela's greatest aspiration is to see them complete their education and become successful in life. \r\n \r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah on behalf of her husband, who wants to repair his rickshaw because its engine is creating problems and doesn\u2019t allow him to work for the hours required to earn a good profit from the business.

Currently, she has two children in her care, one attending the schools of the town where they live.  \r\n\r\nMrs. L. dedicates herself to the sale of snacks such as tacos, enchiladas, and tortillas with cheese in the mornings.  In the afternoons, she sells various products such as cookies, soft drinks, gum, candies, etc.  With these activities she has managed to support her family, and improve their standard of living little by little.  However, she has now decided to expand her business through used clothing.  This is the reason she needs the loan, so she can buy used clothing brought from the United States.  She has realized a study that this clothing will sell very well, and she sees the possibility in opening this type of business in her community.  To sell her snacks, she has to travel to soccer fields and individual homes, whereas she could run the clothing business out of her home and that way tend to her snack shop and care for her children

Emelie is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Emelie from HSPFI.

She owns a business venture, selling fried foods in the local community.  Marie has 3 years of experience in this business.  Marie needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marie joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Marie's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Marie T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She has 3 children, and they live in their own house located in the district of Pichari. Martha is a very hard-working woman who has done agricultural work since she was very young; she learned this work from her parents. One year ago, she left this profession to dedicate herself to caring for children in a \"wawa wasi\" (child care center) in her community. This work is part of a government program which provides care for the benefit of people who have babies and cannot normally work because they do not have anyone to care for their small children. Thus, Martha provides her services caring for babies, because she is very patient and dedicated to them. She feels happy doing this work, which in turn allows her to earn a salary so she can cover her household expenses. In the near future, she would like to open a grocery store.

However, with their current loan many of them have become successful business owners.  For example, Susan U. now has ten artisans working for her during the high season such as Christmas.  Clara P. is a micro-entrepreneur who began with a small business raising animals and who is now buying 100 chickens per month in order to fatten them and resell them 21 days later.  Cecilia U. decided to move into an unexplored field for many micro-entrepreneurs. She has a honey bee business.  In addition, she has a windmill that she rents for grinding corn (an essential component for the preparation of corn tortillas). <p>\r\nThe loans will be used in different ways.  Many women are going to buy thread in order to make huipiles and embroidery.  Clara P. is going to use her loan to purchase more chickens, while Mar\u00eda M. is going to buy another windmill.  Mar\u00eda Y. is going to invest her money in her diner.  She needs a loan in order to purchase glasses, plates, benches and tables. <p>\r\nMar\u00eda M.\u2019s dream is that her business will prosper so that she will be able to open a hammock store and sell hanging beds in natural colors typical of the region.  Elena C. dreams of opening a successful knitting store.  In that way she would be able to purchase more work from her providers and thereby have a positive impact on their lives.

For six years Wilmer has sold optical contacts with his wife. He initially worked with his sister, who started him in this business and encouraged him to become independent and generate his own earnings. He travels by bus to the north side of Nicaragua, more than 120 kilometers to high-risk places because there aren\u2019t many people who travel to the people who live in the mountains or other places far from the city.

She also wants to buy materials such as fabrics, threads, needles, and other items for making her garments.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":237177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To build her textile workshop and purchase sewing supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-15T01:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":189.51},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":193.74},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":202.76},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":216.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":221.2},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":234.01},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":242.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":63.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.59},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.13},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63.17,"local_amount":189.51,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":195.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957849},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":193.74,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:11:55Z","rounded_local_amount":199.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228092},{"amount":67.59,"local_amount":202.76,"processed_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":208.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423324},{"amount":72.13,"local_amount":216.38,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":222.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116583},{"amount":73.73,"local_amount":221.2,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":227.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011517},{"amount":78,"local_amount":234.01,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:27Z","rounded_local_amount":241.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595153},{"amount":80.8,"local_amount":242.4,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":249.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989359}],"funded_date":"2008-12-15T05:23:08Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":82860,"name":"Sun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sun K. was born in 1981 and now lives in the Toek Lorng Village in the Kampong Speu Province.

M. is thirty-five years old, married, and has three children aged between sixteen and eight years old. Her business is located at Lang'ta, Nairobi near a chief's canteen. She has been selling food, e.g., pilau (rice), posho (maize meal), chicken, tea, soft drinks, and other items for the last four years to the local people. \r\n\r\nNancy says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is power fluctuations, reducing quality service delivery.

She is married and has 2 children aged 9 and 3.  In 2000, she established  her cow's milk selling business.  Working 7 days a week and 5 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid 5 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buys a young cow.  In the future, Chanda plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Cristina has decided to seek a larger loan. Last time she used the money to raise chickens and has been doing this for three years. As she and her husband also sell brand name sneakers, the new loan will be used to buy these items, and Cristina will continue to raise chickens. \u2028\r\n\r\nThis job has enabled her to earn money to pay off the loan and improve the standard of living of her family. Now she wishes to invest in the business again as she has orders from customers in the area. This would bring more money into the household. Cristina\u2019s daily chores consist of getting her daughter ready for school, feeding the chickens and a pig she is also raising. \r\n\r\nIn the afternoon she and her husband take the family vehicle and go off to sell both the chickens and the sneakers in nearby communities.

She has demonstrated responsibility in repaying the money each time, and her business is doing well according to data collected in a visit to her small business.\u2028 She owns henhouses and a fridge for the chicken food.

She is 45 years old, married, and the mother of five children who are currently in school. She is a busy trader who treks to Tarkoradi in the Western Region of Ghana to purchase bulk supplies of fish at the seashore so she can sell the fish to her customers. Esi has been in this business for the past 25 years. Because of this business, she has been able to pay for two of her children to complete senior high school.

It is profitable since she takes her clothes and sells them personally.  There also aren't any nearby places where her customers can buy clothing, so they wait to buy clothes from her.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Vaialalua  has 3 years of experience in this business.  Vaialalua  needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nVaialalua  joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Vaialalua 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vaialalua  U. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Mongolia. He and his family live in a traditional nomadic tent called a ger in a small yard that they rent. His oldest son, Davaasuren, attends a local primary school, and his youngest, Temuujin, will soon begin school.\r\n<br>Tugalhuu operates a bread-making business in his town with the help of his wife. They sell the bread that they produce to small grocery shops and service centers throughout their local area. He started his business in 2009 with working capital of 100,000 MNT and has grown his business successfully in a short time.

Maria is 16 years-old and lives in the town of Kireka in the Kampala East region of Uganda.  She is unmarried and has no children.   For the last three years, Maria has had a business of selling shoes.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Maria has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from Kiva partner BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase to buy more shoes.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Maria hopes to generate greater profits and to take care of herself by buying food and clothes.  In the future, Maria hopes to own a house and a vehicle.    \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: \r\n\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.  Initially, the ELA program provides disadvantaged adolescents, particularly girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age, improve their prospects for the future and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and to give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":584570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":346576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

Her years of dedication to her work and home have enabled her to bear good fruits; along with her husband they work to meet the needs of their children within and beyond their home. With her work in various jobs she was able to save a good quantity of money that enabled her to open a grocery store in her home, which she has been running for more than 37 years. Nevertheless, the long hours are difficult because there is a high demand for remaining open at night and she tries to provide her best service in spite of being tired; with her husband and son this work is less intense. Now Rosa is thinking about adding new products to her business and needs capital to make the investment. So she is working in her store every day, providing the best customer service possible to her customers who all these years have become accustomed to visiting Rosa\u2019s store, as she is very friendly with her neighbors. This is her 14th loan with MFP and what has supported her all these years (almost 7) with her communal bank is the teamwork and effort all her colleagues put into the system.

She is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Matalena raises crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale. Matalena has been engaged in this business for more than three years and earns approximately 360 Samoa Tala (about $136) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Matalena joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Matalena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. Matalena is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD. Matalena plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 43 years old and married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Evelyn owns and operates a business planting and harvesting corn to sell. Evelyn has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately $150 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Evelyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Evelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,500 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Evelyn is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her seventh loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

On average they are 26 years old with one child, and they live in the Military Camp of Segou (4th Administrative Region of the Republic of Mali). They came to know each other through their community ties (as they are all either children or wives of soldiers), and they are part of the same traditional association for mutual assistance.\r\n\r\n<p>This group of women buys and sells various types of commercial items. In hopes of increasing the volume of their business, they decided to join the credit program of Soro Yiriwaso from which they are taking first joint loan. This loan will be used to buy 80 pairs of sandals and baby shoes, a wide variety of creams, body lotions, hair pomades, 40 bottles of perfume, deodorant, 50 packets of hair extensions, a half bale of children's sweaters, food condiments (1 basket of fresh tomatoes, 2 large cans of tomato concentrate, 1 bag of cabbage, 6 packets of various Maggi cubes: Maggi chicken, jumbo, Maggi onion), 2 kg of pepper, 25 kg of meat and liver, and ingredients for shish kebabs. They purchase the shoes in Segou and Bamako, the beauty products from the general market of Segou, the hair extensions in Bamako, the second-hand clothes and condiments from the weekly fair in Segou, and the meat, liver and grilling ingredients from the \"ch\u00e2teau\" market. The items are resold either in the Segou Coura market, from home, or by traveling in the area and inside the military camp. The sales are made in cash, in retail, and by credit to a customer base of women and men. They hope to make an average monthly profit of 24,500 FCFA which will be used to repay the loan, to satisfy small family needs, and to participate in social events.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>NB: Fatoumata Diabat\u00e9 is absent from the group photo due to a funeral.<\/p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Jarred Taylor, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":434955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buying various items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:57Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Massan     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yah \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N\u00e8n\u00e8                                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":67452.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763587},{"amount":154.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":67452.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152420},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":67452.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991262},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":67452.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021532},{"amount":154.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":67452.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746334},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":67452.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778886}],"funded_date":"2009-12-09T01:00:37Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jarred Taylor","image":null}},{"id":160964,"name":"Desilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Desilyn Q. is from the village of Poblacion, Catarman Camiguin Province.

This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 26,000, which she intends to use to buy fish stock for her fish vending business as well as more merchandise for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and future savings.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started out with just a little bit of inventory and when she got a loan from D-miro her business started growing.  She works from 7am until 10:30pm.  She always tends to the store herself but if she has to go out occasionally her children help out because her husband is employed. She does not have any difficulties but she\u2019s always very careful because there is lawlessness everywhere. \r\n\r\nShe is in a common law relationship with her spouse, Erwin Ivan Villamar Pe\u00f1afiel, who has worked as a bricklayer for the last 11 years.  They have four children who are 12, 3, 4, and 5 years of age and going to public school.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy foodstuffs like rice, beverages and canned goods.  She hopes to have a large store with lots of customers in the future as well as a large house of her own with a bedroom for each one of her children.\r\n

Mrs. Pao and her husband are in the business of farming. Besides agriculture, they operate another business. She buys and resells recycled items, especially structures or broken parts of wooden houses that can be used again by poor families to rebuild their houses.

She would like to have a shop to put her store and have it well stocked with a variety of products so that she can earn a better income and ensure that her son will get a good education.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy with the help that FRAC and Kiva lenders have given her and thanks to that help, she will enjoy a better quality of life and a good business.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":934764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase merchandise such as milk, eggs, sodas, water, cookies, sugar, beans, toilet paper, soap, and other items.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-12-04T23:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1934.22},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2006.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2102.45},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2224.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2309.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2423.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.07},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.49},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.19},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":144.82,"local_amount":1930.94,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1980.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785194},{"amount":150.74,"local_amount":2009.87,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2061.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193756},{"amount":157.68,"local_amount":2102.45,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2156.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330116},{"amount":165.78,"local_amount":2210.35,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2266.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044131},{"amount":174.24,"local_amount":2323.15,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656384},{"amount":181.74,"local_amount":2423.24,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:56:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2485.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317137}],"funded_date":"2011-12-07T02:44:39Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T16:56:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":370594,"name":"Neang's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A 57-year-old married mother, Neang is a farmer who has five children.

runs a little business selling shoes and clothing at the popular Image shopping center in Beregovo, Ukraine. She has been in business for about four years, has worked hard to develop and improve her company, and recently made a large investment in it by moving into retail space she purchased in the Image center. Paraska once ran a small grocery, but decided to switch to clothing because it generates higher returns. Lending services from Nadiya Ukraine have been instrumental in helping Paraska develop her business. She has proven to be a wise steward with her funds and has repaid every loan on time. Now she has come to us for a loan for $750 to use as working capital to purchase additional sportswear and shoes to sell. She hopes that this summer will be profitable, and she will be able to generate enough sales and income to meet her

Y. was born around 1975 in the KESSOUNOU district of DANGBO village. He is married and the father of two children, none of them attend school. He is a farmer in  GLAHOUNSA village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and is a member of the HOUEDOME group GH MISSIMAHOU DE GLAHOUNSA. The inhabitants of this village work the land after the fall of the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river. Their land is rich and offers a high yield. Their main activity is growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these riverside residents is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. When the river level drops they do not have any money left to pay for the workforce essential for sowing the available land. The local practice of selling cheaply the harvest does not provide them with financial security and further bankrupts them. This practice involves selling the future harvest at a rock-bottom price to an affluent person in order to have the required money to continue farming. Tired of this practice, they are requesting a loan of 140 000 FCFA (USD 275) to farm about 1.5 hectares of the aforementioned land. <p> \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by V\u00e9ronique Fourment, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":237262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farming of 1.5 hectares of corn and peppers  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-10T20:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821546},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357812},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046862},{"amount":54.01,"local_amount":27500,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:56Z","rounded_local_amount":27873.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938480},{"amount":49.11,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25339.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396146},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904023},{"amount":34.36,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126031}],"funded_date":"2008-12-10T21:28:12Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Veronique Fourment","image":442735}},{"id":82908,"name":"Claudia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Claudia is a member of the Se\u00f1or D.
