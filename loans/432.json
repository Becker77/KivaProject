This structural crisis was marked by a significant reduction in purchasing power for Senegalese people and especially those from the least privileged social classes. Entire families failed to meet their food and healthcare needs. It was this desire to find a way to increase their purchasing power that has encouraged these women to start producing and selling cakes that are very much in demand by the local population.\r\n\r\nPutting in place these ovens gives women better access to baking facilities with reduced production costs and will allow them to maximize their profits in this business. The oven will be open to all women who bake cakes and production will take place in town. The women hope to take orders to make cakes for ceremonies and other special occasions. \r\n\r\nThis text was translated from the original French, below:\r\n\r\nLe d\u00e9veloppement du petit commerce surtout du commerce de d\u00e9tail a connu une effervescence \u00e0 partir de la d\u00e9valuation mon\u00e9taire des ann\u00e9es 1980 survenu au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many Dominican clients have recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti).  Her group is located in L. Alcarrizos: a dusty, industrial town north of the capital where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure as a single mother with her child.\r\n\r\nOlfa is excited to be taking her first loan with Esperanza and to have the opportunity to access capital at low interest rates.

With this business, Emmanuel expects to earn more profit, which in turn will allow him to continue paying school fees for his children and reinvesting in his business for a better future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":533984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy a large quantity of spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Byumba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":63782.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145023003},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":63782.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152782033},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":63782.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709945},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T09:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":63782.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167037292},{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T11:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":127564.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177616602},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:50:44Z","rounded_local_amount":63782.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182622802},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":63782.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188760627}],"funded_date":"2010-05-09T19:47:10Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:55:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":202182,"name":"Oxiacaque Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cOxiacaque\u201d  nombrado as\u00ed por que son originarias del  Poblado del mismo nombre.

She earns her living by operating a fish vending business. Her husband Rosaldo works as a truck driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between 7 and 22 years old. Rowena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rowena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 17,000 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 21st  loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Rowena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Josephine Ablawa est n\u00e9e le 20 Mars 1973 au B\u00e9nin et est mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un chauffeur du nom de Gaspard. Le couple a cinq enfants, tous scolaris\u00e9s, dont trois sont \u00e0 leur charge. Josephine Ablawa et sa famille habitent ensemble. Josephine Ablawa a fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9cole et s\u2019est arr\u00eat\u00e9 au cours secondaire. Il y a environs six ans que Josephine Ablawa m\u00e8ne comme activit\u00e9 la vente de produits divers (conserves, savons, farine de manioc, etc.) dans son quartier ; ce qui lui permet de subvenir sans grande difficult\u00e9 aux besoins de ses enfants. Josephine Ablawa s'approvisionne dans l'un des march\u00e9s du B\u00e9nin. La client\u00e8le de Josephine Ablawa devient de plus en plus grande, et Josephine Ablawa voudrait renforcer davantage son activit\u00e9 afin de mieux r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 leurs exigences. Pour ce faire, et ne disposant pas suffisamment de moyens financiers pouvant lui permettre de r\u00e9aliser son r\u00eave, Josephine Ablawa et les autres membres du groupe LA GR\u00c2CE DE DIEU se sont rapproch\u00e9s de AILD\u00e9, en vue d\u2019un premier cr\u00e9dit.","en":"The group La Gr\u00e2ce de Dieu [Grace of God] is made up of three people, all living in the same neighborhood in Benin.  The group\u2019s representative, Josephine Ablawa, is raising her hand in the photo.  This is the first time the group has requested financial support from Alid\u00e9 in order to build their business.  Josephine Ablawa was born on March 20th, 1973, in Benin, and is married to a driver named Gaspard.  The couple has five children, all in school, three of which are still in their care.  Josephine Ablawa lives together with her family.  She attended school, but stopped at the secondary level.  For about six years, she has been working selling various products (canned goods, soaps, cassava root flour, etc.) in her neighborhood.  This business enables her to provide for her children without too much difficulty.  She buys her supplies in one of Benin\u2019s markets.  Her customer base is expanding, and she wants to grow her business in order to better meet the demand.  To do so, and because she doesn\u2019t have the financial resources to make her dream a reality, Josephine Ablawa has come to Alid\u00e9 - along with the other members of the group La Gr\u00e2ce de Dieu - to request their first loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":803038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase boxes of soap, canned goods, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine Ablawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sidonie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":210000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.86},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.85},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.86},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.86},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.86},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.85},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":135.71,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":62790.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221608266},{"amount":67.86,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:18:27Z","rounded_local_amount":31395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226977799},{"amount":67.86,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":31395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232737179},{"amount":67.86,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":31395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238541891},{"amount":135.71,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":62790.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244501518}],"funded_date":"2011-07-11T12:44:35Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:08:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chelsea Rosendale","image":754499}},{"id":312820,"name":"Elvira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvira is 39 years old.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Before joining TYM Fund, her life was really difficult because she could not get any fund to start her business.  Her family income comes from only a 5-acre corn-field.  H.\u2019s first loan from TYM Fund was 50USD.  She used this money to buy soya to make soya curd and sell it to the villagers.  She uses the profit from this small stall and her husband\u2019s wage to pay the weekly repayment.  She also uses the soya waste to feed the pigs. After 6 years, her loan now is 575USD.  From this loan and the savings, she has expanded her business.  Her customers now include not only the villagers but also the other soya curd sellers and restaurant owners near Noi Bai Airport.  She sells up to 50 kg soya curd per day.  At the same time, she buys material for fitting up electrical equipment services.  Her family\u2019s total income now increases to 225USD a month.

He is 59 years old.  He went to school until the 2nd grade under the old system.  He is the father of 3 children with ages between 17 and 22.  The two oldest are at home, and the youngest is in school.\r\n\r\nAlbino began his studies when he was 15 years old, but after finishing the 2nd grade he had to interrupt school due to the bad treatment from his teachers at his school.  Of course he was not very assimilated because his ancestors did not have the financial conditions being that they were country folk.  He left Ch\u00f3kwe for Maputo in search of work.  Having arrived in Maputo he was able to arrange a job at the Hotel Rovuma as a servant and worked for 5 years.\r\n\r\nBecause he salary did not satisfy his necessities he abandoned his job after having had a proposal to work in the Hotel Libombos in Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland.  He only worked there 2 years because it was not a very good work environment.  His colleagues alleged that he did not deserve the responsibilities he was given and he had to leave.\r\n\r\nBut with the funds collected and with the help of his mother who is a dressmaker, Albino started his own tailor and shoe shop, an activity that he learned from the sister missionaries when he was still attending school.  Today he is the owner of a shoe store and tailor called \"Chapo-Chapo\".\r\n\r\nHe works from 7:00am until 6:00pm except on Wednesdays and Saturdays because he goes to the informal market 2 times per week.  He makes more income from the shoes.  Of course many people need his services during the rainy season because the shoes become unglued frequently due to the muddy clay that made sense during that time.\r\n\r\nHe has had a monthly income of 5,000MT and is able to save 1,500MT because he is not responsible for anyone else.  He is the only one in his family that survived the 16 year war.\r\n\r\nThis is Albino's second loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva.  The first loan of 5,000MT was used to purchase a machine to clean shoes, and he is asking for this second loan of 11,000MT to purchase a sewing machine because since the beginning of the year he has had many orders for school uniforms, and he intends to satisfy the necessities of his customers in full and bring in more money as well.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared

Even though she has no children to care for and prepare for their education, Neonita wants to make their living more comfortable and to save a portion of their income for their future.

From the loan and business income, her general store is maximized and has contributed tremendously to the family. As her loans continue, her business improves and now earns a minimum of Php 10,000 per month which she uses for their expenses but saves most of it for her future.\r\n\r\nNeonita's previous loan of Php 15,000 was utilized for her general store and it was fully repaid in full and on-time without delay.

She has always been independent so she wasn\u2019t much bothered by her separation from her husband; her aim in life has always been to get ahead.  She has been a public servant for the last 22 years (she works for a government entity) in a very large province.  She likes to be in permanent contact with people so, for the last 5 years, she has sold beauty products as well as some food items.  Besides, she\u2019s also a farmer; she has banana, avocado and corn crops.  For this last activity, she gets help from her parents who consider Sonia a \u201cJack-of-all-trades\u201d because she is so active.  At her age, she feels that her office work is all-consuming and the pressure and demands made on her sometimes are uncomfortable.  Because of this, her greatest wish is to be able to live in the countryside since farming provides her with the tranquility she needs.  Her activities are quite profitable and, thanks to them, she is able to meet her family\u2019s main needs.  For the future, she would like to be a star saleswoman of the products she offers and consumes as well as increasing her farming output.  This is her fourth loan request to MFP and she is very happy.  She also states that she enjoys working with her communal bank because the members are exacting, responsible, and follow the by-laws well, as it should be, always respectful of others.

Moreover, the income she gets from the business is very helpful in sustaining her family. Additionally, she was able to send her six children to school. Her dream is for her six children to complete college and look for better employment in the future. Because of poverty, there\u2019s nothing to leave her children except a better education. She believes that education is a wealth that others cannot steal. \r\n\r\nVivian hopes that someday she will be able to expand her direct selling of Avon products and Boardwalk supplies. Therefore, she is now requesting another Kiva loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in order to purchase additional needed stock. She believes that having more items will help her retain her current customers as well as attract new clients in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nVivian has been a proud member of Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), a Kiva microfinance partner in the Philippines, since 2008. She is a dedicated member with regular attendance to weekly center meetings and a solid record of repayment on previous loans. Her long-term goals are to have a winning business and to invest in her home. Additionally, she hopes to maintain her business as a sustainable livelihood to support her family. She says thank you to all Kiva supporters around the world for the chance to reach her goals in life and for giving her the financial funds to pursue her business endeavor. She prays that her lenders will be blessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":670912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

She\u2019s doing business while attending to the needs of her family. This is her way of helping her husband with their daily expenses.\r\n\r\nAna owns a variety store selling groceries like canned goods, condiments, milk, sugar, primary commodities that are needed in every household. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also does some tailoring and repairs as an additional source of income. Her regular customers are her neighbors in the local community.  She earns 550 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 24,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more groceries that will accommodate the demands of her customers. She believes that having more display items will definitely attract more customers which means more profit. She will save her profit for the educational expenses of her children.  \r\n\r\nAna hopes that her variety store will soon become a full-scale grocery. She dreams all her children will be able to finish their studies and strives hard to meet the huge amount of their daily expenses.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 240 talas or $100 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Salote joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Salote's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Because of this, in addition to working on the farm, she has decided to buy trees, chop them, and sell them as firewood. In this way, she will have another source of income. She is thinking about opening a grocery store, since she now has her own house, because she likes to be around people and, at the same time, will earn more money.

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband, her co-wife, and their children in the M\u00e9dine district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Having dropped out of school very early on for societal reasons, she started a business only after her marriage and with the goal of supporting her husband (even though he has a high position in the administration) in meeting family needs.  She did several kinds of work, such as selling condiments and fruit.  She opted in the end for commerce in clothing and shoes.  She has been in this business for 27 years working out of her house or going door-to-door.  Bestowed with a large customer base composed mostly of educated women, she has become a great retail merchant in M\u00e9dine due to her dynamism and her high-end clothing. \r\n<p>\r\nFrom the perspective of satisfying her customers indefinitely, she has turned towards Soro Yiriwaso, with which she has been associated for 48 months.  After four solidarity loans and two individual loans, all repaid, she is now on her third individual loan in the amount of 500,000 francs CFA.  She intends to use the loan to buy fifty bolts of Wax <i>pagne<\/i> cloth in Burkina Faso.  She makes her sales at the retail level and accepts cash and credit. \r\n<p>\r\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used to cover certain family expenses (to buy soap, charcoal, and children's clothing) and to honor her debts.  Her ambition is to build houses for personal use and for renting out.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Narra, Brgy Tabugon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living from her eatery, and also as an itinerant vendor.\r\n\r\nCristina\u2019s 63-year-old husband, Aram, is a laborer on a sugarcane plantation.  They have six children who are between 17 and 34 years old. Three of them are raising their own families, while the other three work to help their parents.\r\n\r\nCristina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 with the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of their family's life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income through her eatery and her vending sales. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nCristina is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 was used to fund operations of her eatery and her vending sales. It had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 23rd cycle loan, PHP 12,000, which she intends to use on her eatery business.

Gonz\u00e1lez is a member of La Capilla group who is 69 years old and only studied up to the 2nd year of primary school.  She has seven children: Maria, 49 years old, Santiago, 47, \u00c1ngel, 45, Juan, 43, Agripino, 38, Rosa, 36, and Julia, 33.  All of her children are married except for Santiago who is single and lives with Porfiria. She is asking for a loan to pay for her orders to Fuller (a catalog). She also wants to improve the floor of her apartment and sell Estrella perfumes and cosmetics from the Fuller catalog. Her clients are women, girls, and men and she sells perfume, lipstick, lotion, and makeup. She has been selling from the catalog for 10 years when Adrian first invited her to sell them. It was difficult at first but little by little she learned, bought a calculator to help her make change, and now she is in the habit of selling and cannot stop.  She gives her clients 15 days of credit. She leaves in the morning to sell her products, distribute her orders, charge her clients, and put in new orders. Porfiria considers her work important because it helps with her finances and she enjoys selling the products since she gets to wander while she works. She receives great satisfaction and joy when she gets paid and has money.  She uses the income from her business to buy food, pay for water and lights. She is very happy to be receiving this loan.

As\u00ed fue como inici\u00f3 su negocio  en  el municipio de Santo Tom\u00e1s,  donde viv\u00eda y luego cuando se mud\u00f3 a Barranquilla, retom\u00f3 su trabajo y empez\u00f3 a recomendarse ella misma con su propio oficio,  hasta llegar a incrementar su clientela, que ahora la conforman no solo  personas del barrio donde tiene el negocio, sino tambi\u00e9n de su natal Santo Tom\u00e1s.

She is a seamstress and lives with her partner.  She has two children, thirty-three, and thirty-four. She started her business thirty years ago, sewing her own uniforms.  She got experience sewing for her family because she saw how her neighbor did it.  Later, when she went to work in a sewing factory she perfected her art, which until then had been only the product of her potential as an artisan.  That was how she started her business in the town of Santo Tom\u00e1s, where she lived.  Then, when she moved to Barranquilla, she picked up with her work again and started to market her own services to the point that she grew her clientele, who now comprise not only people from her area, but also from her native San Tom\u00e1s.\r\n\r\nThrough her business, Esramina has succeeded in getting her family ahead and making significant income for the household.  This will be her sixth loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She was able to use prior loan to increase her working capital, because she didn't have much.  Now she feels better able to buy in cash and respond to her clients in a timely fashion.\r\n\r\nWith her Kiva loan, Esramina will stock up on fabrics, ornaments, and thread to show her clients so they can choose the fabrics they want for the new clothes they will sport on special days:  December 7th, the Day of the Immaculate Conception, when everybody gets up early to line their properties with candles and lamps; December 24th, celebrating the birth of the baby Jesus; and December 31st, the last day of the year, marked by big send-offs, with fiestas where everyone exchanges hugs and welcomes the new year with their neighbors and families with whistles, noisemakers, music, and smiles.\r\n\r\nEsramina's dream is to keep growing so she can increase her family's income and always be able to help all of her children and her family in general.  Her biggest challenge is the excess of work she has for all the clientele that are happy with her garments and seek her out.  In seasons like December she doesn't have enough time to respond to everyone and retain them throughout the year. But when the season finally does come, she has helpers that also earn a bit of extra money, so she can get it done with their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":645004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

She lives with her husband in a nuclear family in the neighborhood of Millionking in the city of Fana, prefecture of Dio\u00efla, region of Koulikoro in the Republic of Mali. Mrs Ma\u00efmouna Bah Diarro holds a degree of a vocational training school. Her wish to become integrated into the economic life and provide for her needs led her to learn trade skills, in particular running a grocery store. After several years of experience her business is in high demand and appreciated in Fana. She recently joined our institution and this is her first individual loan.\r\n\r\nShe intends to use her loan to buy packages of cookies, sacks of sugar, boxes of drinking water, jam and racks of sweetened drinks in Bamako. She retails the goods for cash in her easily accessible store located on the main road from Bamako to S\u00e9gou to a clientele made up of women and men.\r\n\r\nShe expects to make an average profit of 50,000 CFA francs a month, which she will use to pay the installments of the loan as well as health services, food and school fees. Any remaining amount will be reinvested in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":687440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Emelita has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Emelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Emelita is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Emelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":735252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Individuals place brunch orders online and pick up the food from a public spot in downtown Detroit.

She is 55 years old. Nora is married and has six adult children. To make a living, Nora owns & operates a hog raising business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Nora has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nora joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from PMPC. Nora is requesting a new loan of 2000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Nora from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is happily married to Amabo Peter and has three children. She is a very hard-working young lady. She was unhappy after the death of her sister and family members due to hardship. Although she did not complete school because of lack of home training, ignorance, and especially poverty, she is still determined to succeed in life and provide for her children what her parents could not provide for her. \r\n\r\nShe plans to invest this loan in raising chickens and cows and selling gateau, a French almond cake. She is going to provide her community with chicken meat and food for her family and community. She will also sell the manure from the chickens to cultivate vegetables and farm products. Experience has taught her how to manage a business like this one. In addition, her farm is located in a very good area. \r\n\r\nShe will used the profit from the loan to educate her grandchildren and provide necessities and medication for them. A. loves GHAPE because of the low interest and the social interactions among members. These interactions bolster her loan use and management.   \r\n\r\n The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":385857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy chicken, cows, and oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntamulung, Bamenda, NW.

27 years old and a member of \u201cLa Estancia\u201d Communal Bank.  She lives in the community also named La Estancia and has two children, ages 8 and 1.  Gladys lives at home with her father because she is a single mother.  Her children are not acknowledged by their biological father, who should be contributing toward child support and household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nGladys tells us she lives in a highly agricultural area where most of the population grows flowers and fruits, such as apples, peaches, and plums, as well as engages in animal husbandry.  She decided to raise guinea pigs and chickens to sell at the Gualaceo Market.  \r\n<p>\r\nMotivated by her friends, Gladys joined the Communal Bank and has now participated in six loan cycles with the Foundation.  The loans have allowed her to succeed in her business and help her children get ahead.  With this new loan, Gladys says she will purchase feed for her animals such as grasses, corn, and vitamins.  Her goal is to grow her business over time so that she can continue supporting her children.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by Oxfam at Thi\u00e8s, in which she became familiar with group organization and running a business. The members of the group are dedicated to what they do, and meet together once a month. Over and above membership dues, each of them pays 200 FCFA a month into a group operating fund.\r\n\r\nLooking for financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. The network is divided into 19 subgroups of five people so that financing can be better handled. Each subgroup has its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey now seek, for the second time, a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member or 500,000 FCFA for each subgroup, to grow their various activities. The members repay their loans to the president and the treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck. They, in turn, are responsible for repaying U-IMCEC. According to the president, the group\u2019s praiseworthy objective is to fight family poverty.\r\n\r\nThe subgroup Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b0 4 consists of the president Ms. Fatoumata T., the treasurer Ms. A\u00efssatou W.

D. M. is 43 years old.  She is married and has 2 children.  She is the treasurer of the \u201cNuestra Se\u00f1ora D. Guadalupe\u201d (Our Lady of Guadalupe) community bank.  In the photo Edith is the lady wearing green pants and brown sweater.  She is sitting down on the far right.\r\n\r\nEdith started her business 7 years ago.  She never thought about becoming a saleswoman since her husband was a policeman and they managed with just his wage.  However, Edith started her business because her daughters were beginning their secondary education and she needed to extend and continue building their home since they lived in a rented house.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for Edith to start out as a saleswoman since she had never worked before.  First she started selling clothes and cosmetics in her home but every holiday season she decided to change her business direction according to the season.  During the back-to-school season she sells school materials itinerantly and during the Christmas period she sells panettones, champagne and canned foods.  However, she still works in her clothes sales business since it provides a weekly income.\r\n\r\nEdith currently needs to work more since her husband is off work sick for 6 months as he fractured his knee.  Owing to the accident, he is no longer bringing in as much money as he used to.  Now Edith's strength to keep going comes from the need to continue educating her daughters so that they become professionals and the need to be able to offer them a better home, acquiring more things they need.  Her husband is currently helping her to look after their daughters and she can now go out to work while he gets better.\r\n\r\nEdith's loan will be used to extend her sales line this Christmas, adding to her sales of panettones by buying champagne and canned food."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3325,"image":{"id":649163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To add merchandise to diversify her sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-11-23T21:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3325,"lender_count":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celedonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica Liz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mirtha Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1552},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1552},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1552},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1552},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1552},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1540}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":554.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":554.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":554.89},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":554.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":554.88},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":554.88,"local_amount":1552,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665382},{"amount":554.88,"local_amount":1552,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408625},{"amount":554.89,"local_amount":1552,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826917},{"amount":554.88,"local_amount":1552,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-18T08:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201269178},{"amount":554.88,"local_amount":1552,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206136067},{"amount":550.59,"local_amount":1540,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:58:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1544.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211208570}],"funded_date":"2010-12-19T19:59:39Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:58:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":255500,"name":"Ely","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ely L. is from the village of Upper Inuman.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Begitu juga hal yang dialami oleh Ni Made Rani. Sudah menjadi tradisi wanita di desa, salah satu usaha yang dilakukan untuk menambah perekonomian keluarga adalah beternak babi. Namun yang menjadi kendala adala kurangnya pengetahuan akan beternak babi yang baik dan benar sehingga usaha yang ditekuni tidak menghasilkan dengan maksimal. Sebelumnya, Ni Made Rani hanya memelihara satu babi penggemukkan dan hanya diberi pakan tradisional yang berupa dedaunan dan sisa makanan di dapur. Hal seperti itu menyebabkan pertumbuhan babi tidak optimal dan tentunya berpengaruh terhadap harga jual. Setelah mendapat pembinaan dan pinjaman modal, sekarang Ni Made Rani memelihara 4 ekor babi yang dipisah dalam dua kandang. Hal itu dilakukannya untuk memudahkan perawatan dan pembersihan kandang. Pinjaman itu digunakan juga untuk membeli pakan yang berkwalitas sehingga sekarang pertumbuhan babinya pesat dan sehat. Dengan adanya perubahan cara beternak, hal ini berpengaruh terhadap pendapatan keluarganya, karena sekarang ia dapat menjual babinya dengan harga yang lebih tinggi.","en":"Ni Made Rani and her husband has one toddler.

She began learning this skill at a very young age.  Then, when her children were born, it was necessary to work and help with the family expenses; so she put into practice what she had learned.  She began making repairs to clothing that was taken to her house and, after some time, began making and selling clothes for her friends and neighbors.  Since Rubi already has experience in this field she is teaching other members so that they are able to have extra income for their households.  She is the president of the Communal Bank.\r\n<p>\r\nThe treasurer is Constantina P..  For 10 years, she has had a shop.  She began her business selling on an itinerant basis.  This was a very difficult situation until the municipality provided an area where all the itinerant businesses could establish themselves. It was there that she acquired a stall and put in her shop, the business that she has operated until now, but that is not all she does.  In her free time, Constantina crochets bags.  She learned this in a market where she brought yarn for weaving.  She makes different types of bags, and now she and other persons have the opportunity to export these to Mexico and Venezuela.\r\n<p>\r\nOrfelinda operates her business according to the season.  In the summer, she sells cold drinks.  In the winter she sells hot chocolate or mate.  She is the group\u2019s secretary.\r\n<p>\r\nAll are responsible and consider themselves fortunate because by means of honorable work they can offer their families the necessities of life.

M\u00f3nica works Monday through Sunday from 7am to 7pm.  In addition, she sells American clothes and Yanbal beauty products to friends and relatives.  She visits them in their homes so that they can view the products and place orders.\r\n<p> \r\nM\u00f3nica has been working with the Communal Bank for 3\u00bd years after her mother convinced her to join the group.  She says the loans have helped to increase her operating capital.  This current loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR will be used to buy American clothes such as pants, coats, blouses, etc.  Her greatest dream is to finish her studies so that she can become a professional teacher at a preschool and not depend on anyone.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She\u2019s had a karaoke bar in town for the past two years.  Despite being a single mother, she\u2019s independent of her parents and has been her 4-year-old daughter\u2019s sole source of support.  This motivates Diana to invest in this business because there is no other like it in town and it is the only place where people can go for amusement.\r\n\r\nDiana is a very responsible person and to date has had no problem repaying her loans to the foundation.  She has used prior loans to provide her business with chairs, tables, a freezer, a computer, a sound mixer, microphone and beverages.

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Miguela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to add more products to sell to her customers so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of her business. Miguela is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Teachers from this institution, like their many counterparts in SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT\/Kiva lenders to seek loans. These loans have proven to be very helpful to salaried workers because they empower recipients to buy or invest in things that their salaries cannot cover. For example, with the help of loans, recipients are able to buy a plot of land, start building a house, buy house-building materials and furniture, or pay school fees for their children. At the end of each month, the group finance officer repays SMT\/Kiva on their behalf.\r\n\r\nMomodu is the leader of this group of teachers. He is 49 years old and was born in the town of Port Loko. Momodu is married and has 11 children, eight of whom are attending primary and secondary schools.

At this moment I need to buy clothes because I do not have a lot of product in stock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":57409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase bales of used clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Tegucigalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.1 -87.216667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":5,"posted_date":"2007-08-29T00:35:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergio Ramon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-12T07:47:14Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-10-28T17:20:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-11T09:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73260},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T17:08:44Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-11T09:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":89154},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-01-15T05:05:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-11T09:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":115756},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-02-23T19:17:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-11T09:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140974},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-03-29T04:54:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-11T09:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":168162},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-05-02T01:30:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-11T09:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":198199},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T22:28:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-11T09:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227286},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-07-10T18:42:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-11T09:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263524}],"funded_date":"2007-08-29T07:47:14Z","paid_date":"2008-07-10T18:42:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":21136,"name":"Nim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nim N., age 31, sells vegetables along the roadside, earning about $3 each day.

From the time she was a girl, she knew what it meant to work on a farm and she learned the jobs required to run one.  Six years ago, she started growing alfalfa, a grass that is used to feed animals.  Growing and selling alfalfa is very profitable because most of the people in the area keep animals and have to feed them.  Mary meets the demand.  She has to cut the alfalfa every fifteen days in order to sell it.  This is her 13th MFP loan and she's never missed paying an installment on a past loan.

She is a very resourceful mother whose hard work brings livelihood to the family.\r\n\r\n<P>Faustina supports her two grandchildren through the sale of used clothing, curtains, clothing materials and bedsheets. There is a large market for used clothing, curtains, and bedsheets in Ghana, because brand new clothes are very expensive for the economically active poor.

Marceline lives in a mountainous area to the west of Kinshasa, where she works at her small business selling salted fish.  Besides selling fish, she also sells <i>chikwangues<\/i> (a kind of bread made of cassava flour).  Sometimes, her customers eat these foods on site or take them home.  Basically, she\u2019s in the midst of starting up a mini-restaurant.  Right now, her capital amounts to $72.  She started her business in 2000 with $15 of initial capital that had enabled her to buy some charcoal to resell.  Her business prospered through 2006.  \r\n<p>\r\nMarceline\u2019s ill health, caused by a surgery undergone in 2006-2007, prevented her from doing commerce fully.  In the second half of 2007 through today, she started back up again by including fresh fish.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe joined one of groups of the micro-finance institution HOPE named \u201cJoyce\u201d in February 2008 with the goal of receiving renewable financial support for developing her business.  She received loans from HOPE four times, and she repaid them regularly and completely.  In April, she used the loan received to buy some salted fish, and she diversified by including kerosene, as well as vegetable oil, intending to grow her revenues.  \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, her business generates for her a profit of $33 a week.  Her ambition is to buy a freezer with the goal of preserving the fresh staple goods that her customers  have often needed.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":306815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy salted fish and to diversify her business with kerosene and vegetable oil for increasing her income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Together with his wife he has been raising cattle for more than 14 years. This produces the income which allows him to feed his children and his wife. As well as caring for his livestock, he also cultivates wheat, which helps with the family's diet and provides additional income. Sultonmurod has asked for this loan to buy young cattle in order to obtain a better profit. His greatest wish is to be able to improve his farm by constructing enclosures and establishing better grazing for his livestock.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

So she decided to work selling sodas and ice cream from the first floor of her mother\u2019s house. She has worked for fifteen years in this business and she has enjoyed it. Actually, she also sells beer. The largest quantities of beer sales are during the weekends. She is well known to her neighbors and thanks to them her business has generated a good income. She is very motivated to continue working. In the upcoming months she is going to begin to knit sweaters. Her neighbor, who knits, invited her to join her in this work. She can knit while she works in her store. In the future she would like to install booths with Internet access in her large location. She would like to sell time on the Internet.
