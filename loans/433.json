Saidhamza\u2019s life. He has always responded satisfactorily to his role as provider for his six children, for whom he cares with much love, in the company of his wife, who is always supportive of him. Saidhamza works in agricultural activities and has some cattle. He cultivates wheat, and potatoes and other vegetables depending on the season. At the moment, he is working intensively at his agricultural activities and taking care of his fields. His wife is helping take care of the cows and also sells their milk. They do all this hard work because they want to give an education to each of their children. They would also like to open a small business some day but, until then, they will continue working in their fields. To do this, Saidhamza is requesting a loan of $2200 USD to buy seeds, mineral fertilizers and young cattle. Let\u2019s support Saidhamza in his continuous efforts to provide for the wellbeing of his family. \r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells her goods mainly on credit to her loyal customers through hawking - that is, she uses a personal selling method; this, she said, makes her goods move very fast. She also sells fried yam with hot pepper to supplement her clothing and materials business.\r\n\r\nJuliana is 35 years old and is a married mother with four children. All her children are in school.

She lives with Andr\u00e9s, age 60, and they have six minor children.  She is raising the children in her own house, which is in the indigenous community of Pumpuriani.\r\n\r\nSince she was a girl she has been working in the noble agricultural trade.  Being able to feed the population is very dependent upon her work and the productivity of the land.  Twenty years ago, thanks to her effort and her savings, she was able to get land for crops.  She started growing coffee, bananas, and avocados.  After giving them the necessary care she sold them to her customers that visit her.\r\n\r\nHowever, the avocado crop gives Bertha the greatest income.  She is the only one in her area that grows this crop.  She sells them in great quantities to merchants throughout the country.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes the best is burning her fields after the harvest. (This removes the old growth to make way for new plantings.)  That way there will be new harvests.

runs four little vending facilities where she sells a variety of spices and seasonings at the central food market in downtown Ivano-Frankivsk. Nadiya has been in business for 10 years. She has about $4,000 in inventory and presently her net profit amounts to around $1,000-$1,200 per month.    \r\n<p>\r\nNadiya is very friendly and cheery. Because of her cheerfulness and good service her total number of customers is consistently growing. Reasonable prices, hard-work and tenacity have helped her enterprise reach sustainability and success. The twenty loans she has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d are another reason why her business has been so successful. While working with our organization, Nadiya was able to purchase her fourth vending facility and increase her sales volume. \r\n<p>\r\nNadiya has requested a loan for $600 to purchase 10 kilograms of dried mushrooms and a variety of different spices and seasonings that she will sell in her kiosks.  This loan will help her re-supply her inventory and encourage more customers to come and buy from her. Increased sales will generate the necessary funds to sustain her business as well as to meet her family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0412 \u041d\u0430\u0434\u0456\u0457 \u2013

Houenafa is married to Felix Zoungni, the head of the Zogbo district in Cotonou. She is the mother of six children of whom two are deceased and only two are currently enrolled in school. Three years ago Houenafa began selling food. She sold fried rice to private school children not far from the Zogbo district. To this business she added the sale of donuts made of wheat flour.

Her son helps her with the business. With an endless list of requests, she has finally decided to increase the number of her animals she keeps.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 65 years old. Ching is married. To make a living, Ching owns & operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as candies, soy sauce, shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Ching has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ching joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ching has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Ching is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Ching from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He is 29 years old. Philipp is single. To make a living, Philipp owns and operates a business venture in the services sector operating transportation services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating motor transport services. Philipp is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Philipp joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Philipp is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to repair existing vehicle for better service. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Philipp from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She has, therefore, set aside space in her house for a workshop that she\u2019s equipped with tools like: sawhorses and embroidery frames.  Her work period is usually in the morning and she spends the afternoon taking care of her daughter.  She enjoys her work because she considers herself a very creative person for she applies novel designs and colors so that her embroidery will be attractive to her customers.  Besides, being done by hand adds value to her work and it\u2019s thus better paid.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan request at MFP; a girl friend invited her and encouraged her to become part of a communal bank.

She has been in a domestic partnership for the last 7 years with Raydo, who is currently living in the city of Lima because of his job. Marcelina and Leidy (her daughter) live in the house that Marcelina owns in the district of San Luis de Shuaro, Chanchamayo. Despite her young age, Marcelina works in agriculture, which she learned from her parents. She has 3 blocks of crop fields on which she cultivates coffee and bananas. \"Coffee is lucrative, but it is harvested only once a year. Banana trees, on the other hand, produce every 15 days, and on those days I make 300 to 400 PEN,\" she states. The most frequent problem she faces is the lack of capital to fertilize her crops. She fertilizes her fields every 4 months, investing no less than 700 PEN, which is something that she has managed to bear. Raydo, her partner, does not neglect his family since he travels to Chanchamayo at the end of each month with the money that he makes at an auto shop. In the future, Marcelina will open a small general store in her community in which she will sell basic need items. Thus, she will be able to have the money she needs to give her daughter a quality of life that neither she nor her partner ever had.  This will be her fifth loan from MFP, which is why she is committed to being punctual in making her monthly repayments. Additionally, she demonstrates joy working with her communal bank because of the incentives and the business opportunities that it gives her. The planting and harvesting season during the months of December and January seem promising, so Marcelina will invest the loan in purchasing bags of fertilizer.

She is also raising her 6-year-old niece.  \r\n<p>\r\nLastenia is a member, and the official treasurer, of the communal bank <i>Manos Maravillosas<\/i> (Marvelous Hands) and lives in the city of Pucallpa.  Lastenia has been working with Manuela Ramos for 2.5 years and used her first loan to start her drink-selling business.  Lastenia will invest this loan of 1700 nuevos soles in more inventory for her business.  Lastenia is thankful for the support she has received from Manuela Ramos and is very pleased that things have been going well with her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":346928,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more soft drinks and juices ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-07-02T03:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lastenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":283.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":283.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":287.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63206083},{"amount":95.95,"local_amount":283.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":287.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635338},{"amount":95.71,"local_amount":282.99,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":287.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074408},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":283.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:09:36Z","rounded_local_amount":287.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989751},{"amount":95.95,"local_amount":283.68,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":287.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834723},{"amount":95.73,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:57Z","rounded_local_amount":287.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726657}],"funded_date":"2009-07-12T18:32:49Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":123996,"name":"Ton","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ton S., 49, is a married mother blessed with six children.

Her husband, Mr. Hung Horm, is a construction laborer. \r\n\r\nIn the rice field, they have had some problems because it has a lot of insects and it is far from an irrigation system. Thus, Mrs. Near S. decided to ask for a loan to buy pesticides and will use the rest of the loan to buy fuel to improve the production of rice. She is a mother of three children, one of whom is a laborer, while the others are attending a local public school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":491771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She works in this city as a primary school teacher for the Ministry of Education. The loan will be used to buy 12 sheets of corrugated iron roofing and 8 metal beams to construct the roof of her kitchen. Her kitchen is made of wood and is in bad shape. In the winter it leaks, which is why she needs to make the repairs right now. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Carmen has been a teacher for 14 years. She started as a pre-school teacher, continued attending teacher college and 4 years later began to teach primary school. She now teaches at a small rural school, traveling everyday to the community of Santa Isabel. Before becoming a teacher, Do\u00f1a Carmen would go to classes in the mornings, then sell fried snacks like enchiladas from her house in the afternoon. This helped her pay for her schooling and provide for her children. She also had help from her husband, who worked as a carpenter.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Do\u00f1a Carmen hopes to fix her roof and provide better safety and satisfaction to her daughters, who are also impacted by this problem. Do\u00f1a Carmen is a married mother of 2 daughters: one is 17 years old and in her 5th year of secondary school, the other is 8 years old and in the 3rd grade. Her husband is unemployed; he is currently helping out with housework while looking for work, but it is difficult because unemployment rates are high in the country right now. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Carmen is a hardworking woman but her income is low because teachers are not well paid, due to budgetary and economic problems in the country. With these loans, she has been able to slowly improve her house while using her teacher's salary to cover household expenses. Thus, she is able to pay for her necessities and can say that she has improved her quality of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva

She is 29 years old, married, and mother of a two-year-old son who does not yet attend school.  Aurora finished twelfth grade but did not continue because she began working and was unable to go ahead with school.  She lives in teachers' housing with her family and supports a nephew and a cousin who live with her.\n\nShe left Moatize for Boane when she came to visit relatives and ended up staying to continue her studies.  She works as a teacher and has been employed by the Ministry of Education for more than six years.  She has no employees and receives a monthly salary of 5,570 meticais, which she uses for household expenses.  She also manages to save some money in her bank account.\n\nAurora had a previous loan with Tchuma Credit Union but decided not to continue with them for several reasons.  She learned about Hluvuku through co-workers who are also customers of this institution.  This is her third loan.  She is asking for 21,300 meticais which she will use to buy construction materials (zinc sheets, block, beams, cement and other items) to continue construction on her house.  The previous loans of 5,000 meticais and 10,000 meticais were for the same purpose.\n\n\nShe promises to pay off this loan on time to maintain her good credit.  In the future she would like to ask for more loans so she can finish her house.\n\n\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

Only one child is under 15 and some are in school. She lives in Ntasen, an area in Bamenda, in the north-west region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nHer major challenges in life has been the difficultly of her children dropping out of school and inadequate capital to start a business for herself before joining GHAPE. She has also suffered greatly from ill health. Given a loan, she plans to buy pig feed, firewood, medicines for the animals and to pay for the maintenance of her pigsty and the transportation of her newly bought piglets to their rearing site. \r\n\r\nGrace knows her business is going to succeed because she has acquired some basic training in financial management and pig rearing from GHAPE. She has also chosen to diversify her income by investing some of her capital in a firewood business and she has the land to support a successful business. The loan, if granted, will enable her to sell in her neighborhood at cheaper rates, providing firewood to her neighbors. She joined GHAPE in 2006 and has since successfully borrowed and repaid loans four times.\r\n\r\nShe will reinvest her profits back into her business and use part to it to care for her family. She will also use the proceeds to finish a construction plan she earlier started, building two new rooms. Her children\u2019s school needs will also be taken care of. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost of obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":843651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy feed, seeds, firewood and to pay for the maintenance of the pigsties and transportation of the piglets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntahsen Market Square, NW.

All of the members are hardworking women who want to succeed in life and help their families.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members is Sra. Luisa.  She is 26 years old and a hardworking woman who is full of life.  Luisa strives to succeed in life and fulfill her dreams.  She is happily married to Sr. Anastacio, who is 32 years old.  Her husband has worked as a farmer and a bricklayer since he was 26.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Luisa has been selling chickens for 10 years.  She enjoys this type of work, but when she has a few chickens she will stop selling so that she can use what she has to feed her family.  Occasionally she will extend credit to people that she knows and they will have a week to pay for the chickens.  Luisa has two children, an 11-year-old daughter and a 7-year-old son.  Her children help with butchering and plucking the chickens and then she cleans them.  What she enjoys most about her business is cleaning and butchering the chickens because she watched her mother perform these duties when she was a girl and also got to help her.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Luisa finished her high school education.  She knows how to read and write very well, but she also enjoys mathematics.  Luisa has a grocery store, so she knows how to make change, buy merchandise, calculate how much she will pay, and determine whether she should buy.  She is requesting a loan to buy more chickens to sell in her community and in the neighboring areas.  Luisa is extremely grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the support that has been given to her so that she can move forward and succeed in life.  If she was not working, then she would not have extra funds for whenever unexpected emergencies arise.  Luisa is considered to be an intelligent, hardworking, and responsible person because of the values instilled in her by her parents.  She now wants to pass those same values on to her children.  \r\n<p>\r\nThanks to the support Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad has given to the other members of the group, they have been able to expand their businesses, generate more earnings, and help their families.  The other members of the group are as follows:\r\n\u2022\tMar\u00eda del Carmen sells fish.\r\n\u2022\tEmma sells live and butchered chickens.\r\n\u2022\tFrancisca sells gasoline.\r\n\u2022\tElizabeth sells Mexican street food.\r\n\u2022\tCarmen sells live and butchered chickens.\r\n\u2022\tEufemia In\u00e9s sells live and butchered chickens.\r\n\u2022\tAraceli sells Mexican street food.\r\n\u2022\tMatilde sells Mexican street food.\r\n\u2022\tJustina sells milk and cheese.\r\n\u2022\tLeslie Diana sells Mexican street food.\r\n<p>\r\nThey thank Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for helping them change their lives.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":911038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens to butcher and sell.

With $50 he opened up his shop and sold to people walking down the street.

is a cheerful and enterprising lady who has worked since a young girl to help her parents out.  Her strong desire to realize her goals continues to this day.  She has gone through difficult times, including a partner who abandoned her leaving her alone with three daughters.  She had to double her efforts to make a living, and so began a partnership with her sister renting cell phones in the capital city.  All the while her business in Lima continues, she also sells jewelry, purses and other merchandise.  Recently, her sister asked her to make a deposit of their savings at the bank.

She is 36 years old, married, and the mother of four children of whom three are still dependent.  \r\n<p>\r\nRubi was motivated to start a small business selling groceries so that she could contribute to the household income.  She obtained very good results from her first loan of 300 soles.  From that point, she improved the quality of her products, offered affordable prices, and provided good customer service.  Rubi continues to operate her business out of her home to this very day.

The majority of the population works in farming and cattle ranching and most of the young people have moved abroad to provide a better future for their families.

They were raised with these activities and have maintained them as family traditions.\r\n\r\nLaura V., lives in the San Antonio neighborhood of Cumbe and is 32 years old.

She lived in her own home, which she inherited from her parents, but her brother mortgaged it to be able to go to the United States. Once arriving in the States, he forgot about his debt and now the house is going to be auctioned off. She currently has her belongings in another location and only her bed remains in the home, taking care of it until it is sold.\r\n\r\nSince being married, Laura has raised chickens and guinea pigs to sell in her community. She also washes clothing and cleans houses, and often does this work three days a week.\r\n\r\nShe was introduced to the foundation by her brother-in-law and began receiving loans six years ago. The loans she has received have helped her develop her chicken business, and she will use the current loan to purchase more chickens as well and corn and vitamins for their proper development.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to get her home back or to be able to build another.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda T. has been a member of the Cumbe Communal Bank for six years.

Her two oldest children are married and live abroad, but only one of them helps her financially. Her husband is also abroad and his hard work has enabled them to build their own home.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda raises guinea pigs, chickens, hens, and pigs.

D\u00e1vila is a farmer who lives in the community of San Jer\u00f3nimo located about 30km from Condega. He owns a small farm there and grows crops such as beans, maize and coffee which he then sells. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking for will be used to buy agricultural supplies such as 6 quintales (unit equal to 100lb) of fertilizer and 6 quintales of urea. Reynaldo will use these products on his coffee crops to ensure a good harvest. He began farming when, in the 1980s, the state gave him two manzanas (about 3.5 acres) of land on which to grow coffee as part of the agrarian reform program. Nowadays he raises animals as well as growing crops. He sows beans on 4 manzanas and maize on 2 manzanas in the winter. He also sows coffee beans once a year as his farm is located in a high mountainous area with appropriate conditions for growing coffee.\r\n\r\nReynaldo has done this kind of work since he was small, starting out by helping his parents on their small farm. With the loan he hopes to use the products on his crops so he can get a bigger and better-quality harvest. Then he will get the chance to sell the products for a better price, especially the coffee which is very important since it is an export crop.\r\n\r\nDon Reynaldo is married and has three children, two of whom attend primary school. He has had six loans since 2005 and used the money for his farm. The impact and benefits have been important as they have allowed Reynaldo to expand his farm, increase the harvests, and improve his quality of life. During this period he has built a small house, bought four cows that had recently given birth, two bullocks, and also more land. He currently has 4 manzanas growing coffee, 6 manzanas growing other crops, and 4 manzanas of trees. It is very clear that this client has benefited greatly from the loans.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":509505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy agricultural supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reynaldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":190423,"name":"Hilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (greetings) from Tanzania!

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":517370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional cloth for her tailoring business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Morogoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.816667 37.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eva van Emden","image":1021631}},{"id":194519,"name":"Mary Muthoni","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a married woman, 28 years old and a mother of one child.

Ruth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Ruth is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and to provide working capital. This loan will be the fifth loan taken  out by Ruth from PMPC.

They have five children who are 10 months to 16 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Liz joined NWTF-Project Dungganon 6 years ago because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Ma.

This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital primarily for her bakery and also for her other business activities. She will continue to save up for the future and improve her family's living conditions. Ma.

They have two children: 22 year-old Jonatan and 7 year-old Yeison.  The family live in their own home in the village of Canayre, in Llochegua district.  Feliciana has always been restless since she was a little girl; she never liked sitting around not doing anything.  When the opportunity presented itself, she would help her parents with their household chores.\r\n\r\nFor 25 years now, Feliciana has been selling clothes to the general public.  She recalls that her first year was difficult, in her second year she started to get things on an even keel and from then on she was very blessed because her sales increased.

","en":"Eunice Castellar is a woman living in the city of Cartagena very near to sports venues.  She sells assorted goods in this beautiful place.  The business helps meet household expenses.  Her family consists of her husband and two children who are 3 and 6 years of age.\r\n\r\nEunice initially learned this occupation from her mother.  They would travel to the La Guajira Department to bring merchandise to sell at a very domestic marketplace, that is, among family members and nearby neighbors.  Once her mother retired from the business and Eunice had managed to secure a larger market she managed to amass a small bit of capital.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she will use it to buy clothes for women, children and men because she has pending orders from customers as well as new customers she\u2019s winning over.\r\n\r\nEunice says that income from the business has provided her with economic independence since she and her husband very much want to provide wellbeing for their family so that when the children grow up they can provide higher education for them.  Her goal now is to diversify because her clientele is asking for other items every day like athletic shoes, for example, and she wants to sell them on credit.\r\n\r\nHer main challenge is the lack of capital to respond to market demand.  This is why she\u2019s asking the Fundaci\u00f3n for a loan to be able to buy clothing for women, children and men; this is the reason for her Kiva loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":729109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" to buy clothing for women, children and men.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-03-12T19:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eunice Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1060000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":74664},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80835},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82385},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83964},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":85573},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87213},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":88885},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90588},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":92325},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":94094},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":95898},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":103576}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.85},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.69},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.55},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.31},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.08},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.72,"local_amount":93500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":95250.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289293},{"amount":57.69,"local_amount":106351,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":108342.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157452},{"amount":66.87,"local_amount":123266,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":125574.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230464},{"amount":70.93,"local_amount":130752,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":133200.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509321},{"amount":70.33,"local_amount":129650,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":132077.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673541},{"amount":72.81,"local_amount":134227,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:42Z","rounded_local_amount":136740.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320098},{"amount":20.38,"local_amount":37576,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":38279.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803237},{"amount":75.81,"local_amount":139752,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:15Z","rounded_local_amount":142369.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614321},{"amount":89.46,"local_amount":164926,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:58:52Z","rounded_local_amount":168014.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568299}],"funded_date":"2011-03-15T10:15:33Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:58:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":284683,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George lives in Kiambu where he does dairy farming.
