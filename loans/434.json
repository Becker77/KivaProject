As part of the village bank, the four of them receive a loan together and the responsibility for repayment is on all four women.   They are asking a total loan of US$ 1200. Fortunata will use her share to buy more ingredients to prepare her \"moliente\".<P>\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a bustling street market in Ayacucho, Peru, Fortunata can be found every day behind her cart selling \u201cmoliente,\u201d hot herbal beverages. In addition to herbs and teas, she also has a small supply of homeopathic remedies. Her most popular product is a blend of \u201cs\u00e1bila,\u201d a type of cactus leaves that she cuts open and then scrapes out the insides. She adds honey, and a variety of herbal teas. She tops this mixture off with a little hot water, and stirs well.

Teo has been operating her shop for 7 years and finds business to be fair.<p>\r\n\r\nIn order to make clothes for both men and women, Teo rides a matatu (a shared van) into Kampala to buy textiles and then returns to the store she rents to do the tailoring. She serves an average of 5 customers a day and with the revenues from the tailor shop has been able to open a bar in which she sells beer and soda.<p>\r\n\r\nTeo got her first loan from MCDT 4 years ago and has successfully paid back 8 loans. By working with MCDT, she has been able to sell more clothes because she can get more materials to serve more customers. In addition, she has expanded to making uniforms for a local elementary school, The Red Star School. This success has not come without difficulties, as some people do not pay on time for the clothes she has made or sometimes do not pay at all, making it difficult to predict and rely on a steady cash flow.<p>\r\n\r\nDue to the proceeds she has garnered thus far, Teo has been able to sustain her family and send all her children to school. With this loan, she hopes to get a step closer to her future goals of expanding her businesses and buying a new plot of land for her house.<p>\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Ruth N., who sells old clothes; Hamida N., who owns and runs a salon; Robina Nabosa, who sells charcoal; and Miriam M., who sells raw food."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":174204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To stock more materials to make clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2008-07-04T03:50:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hamida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-18T17:24:44Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":258.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":259,"local_amount":401032.26,"processed_date":"2008-08-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":406759.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":300145},{"amount":259,"local_amount":401032.26,"processed_date":"2008-09-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-19T07:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":406759.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":330845},{"amount":259,"local_amount":401032.26,"processed_date":"2008-10-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-23T07:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":406759.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364931},{"amount":256.33,"local_amount":396903.22,"processed_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T21:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":402571.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5334419},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-30T08:52:32Z","rounded_local_amount":405712.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9955614},{"amount":258.34,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-18T08:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":405712.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14875985}],"funded_date":"2008-07-04T17:24:44Z","paid_date":"2009-02-18T08:53:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":58101,"name":"Juan Antonio","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Juan Antonio began his career working for a newspaper for a period of five years, after which he took the initiative to start his own business since he was receiving a very low salary at the paper and he had a desire to improve his life.

Since before she was married she has been buying and selling fruit at wholesale and retail with her mother. For the past 6 years she has been working in the municipality of her area, so Monday through Friday her mother is in charge of the business and on Saturdays and Sundays they sell together. Additionally, every night they both do the accounting for their sales. Deyci is a business woman who has various sources of income from different businesses. In spite of having a stable job she has not stopped selling fruit because it is very profitable, and in the past she was able to support herself solely from these earnings. She knows that she cannot ask her mother to be fully responsible for the business because there are days that she sees her mother is very tired because she doesn\u2019t have the same energy today as when she was younger.

His wife is a homemaker. Vali is a dentist with 15 years of experience working at the local dental clinic. This year, Vali plans to celebrate a wedding for one of his daughters. His daughter is a college student and many young men wish to marry her. Vali needs this loan to provide for a proper dowry and pay for the wedding party. Vali D. is a good doctor and has many loyal patients. Unfortunately, due to frequent interruptions of electric power in the local clinic, Vali's workload there decreased. As an alternative, Vali D. is working at a private clinic where he can work without interruption. Vali thanks all Kiva lenders for their generosity and hopes to apply for another Kiva loan soon to finance opening of a private practice.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk,

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her husband and three children.\r\n\r\nTania is excited to be taking her tenth loan  with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her beauty salon by purchasing a basin for washing hair as well as a line of hair products, including shampoo and straighteners. She will use the profits to invest in her children by purchasing food, shoes, pencils and backpacks for them. She would also like to purchase a vehicle. Finally, she would like to invest in her business by securing a locale for it that is in a high traffic area and which is big enough to accommodate an ice cream shop as well.

His partner, with whom he has 5 children, helps him.  Eduardo started the business working, with his brother for 17 years, then striking off on his own by investing his savings in a similar business.  He started with just two tables but, over time, the business has grown and he now has two food stalls.  Among other things, he sells hamburgers, hotdogs, sausages and grilled chicken, to which he adds his own special sauce.  He operates the business from 5:00pm to 11:00pm during the week and from 5:00pm to 1:00am on weekends.  This is Eduardo's fifth loan from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, a bank that has long supported him.  He says that he always saves for slow periods of the year and that the bank has helped him buy tables and chairs which have helped him to improve the business and make it more comfortable for his customers.  He will use this loan from Kiva to buy tables and chairs and ingredients for the food he makes.  Although this Eduardo's only business, it has allowed him to support and improve the lives of his family.  Now he hopes to set up a similar business in his home \"departamento\" of Cordoba so that he can continue to expand it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

M. is 31 years old. She lives with her 12-year-old son in her parents' home in the neighborhood of La Victoria. Although this is an urban zone, it is one of the poorest in the city of Chiclayo. The majority of the population makes a living in some form of urban subsistence, selling just enough on a daily basis to meet basic needs.\r\n\r\nVioleta works as a street vendor in and around the Mercado A-Z, one of the smaller markets just outside of the city. She sells a wide variety of fruits. She follows seasonal crop offerings in selecting her merchandise. Violeta purchases the fruit from wholesalers in the area and then resells it at retail prices.  She has been running this business for three years.\r\n\r\nThis will be Violeta\u2019s first loan. She has never worked with a financial institution before. She plans to use the loan to purchase additional fruit at greater discounts by making a large bulk purchase. She expects that this will increase her profit margin and enable her to reinvest a greater portion of her income in growing her daily inventory.\r\n\r\nVioleta is well respected in her neighborhood and has good references. She has great dreams of helping her son complete school and become a professional. She hopes her business will continue to maintain the family and support her son in his ongoing education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":619374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional fruit at greater discounts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La Victoria - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-10-17T14:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Violeta Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":40.02},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40.32},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":41.21},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":41.52},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41.76},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":42.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":42.76},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":43.07},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":43.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.01},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.13},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.2},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.48},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.71},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.85},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.97},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.11},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":97.79,"local_amount":244.48,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":272.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177555162},{"amount":102.21,"local_amount":255.52,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":284.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530566}],"funded_date":"2010-10-17T14:17:41Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:45:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":243334,"name":"Sherapat","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041a\u0430\u0448\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0428\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0443\u043d\u0437\u0430\u0434\u0435. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442, 55 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0430, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430. \u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435. \u0417\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435 \"\u0414\u0435\u0445\u043a\u043e\u043d\". \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430. \u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 10 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u0438.","en":"Sherapat K. lives in the town of Turzun-zoda.

C. owns and operates a restaurant business, and the primary source of income comes from serving dinner foods to customers in the local community.  C. has been in this business for over 22 years, and she earns approximately 3.900.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, C. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services, to help improve her living situation, and to give her the ability to engage in business activities.  C. successfully repaid a previous loan of 7.392.000 VND from SEDA, which was used to purchase food and drinks for the restaurant.  C. is requesting a new loan of 8.736.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital.  This will be her 5th loan from SEDA, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Vazifa is a 44-year-old woman.

In addition to her children, she supports a daughter-in-law who lives with her.  <P>\r\n\r\nAlzira grew up with her parents.  She studied through 9th grade and then discontinued her studies because she fell ill.  Besides going to school, she also learned how to sew.  She used to make children\u2019s clothes, an activity which she stopped when she got married in 1989.  Now she lives in her own house.  <P>\r\n\r\nAlzira has been living basically off a business, renting out a commercial space, for three years.  Her store opens at 7:00am and closes at 9:00pm everyday.  She employs one woman.  She learned this business activity from her father-in-law, who is a major businessperson who has several commercial enterprises in the city of Maputo.  <P>\r\n\r\nThe store provides a variety of products, mostly basic groceries.  The highest-margin products are sodas and beer, which she sells for an average of 25 meticais (MTn) per beer and 10MTn per soda.  Her daily sales range from 500MTn to 1500MTn, and she manages to save some money each month.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Alzira\u2019s first loan with Hluvuku (Kiva\u2019s Field Partner) and with Kiva.  Previously she took out loans from other banks in the amount of 5500MTn to start her business.  Now she plans to use this loan to increase her product offerings in order to increase her profits.  Her greatest dream is to build her own commercial space.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

She used to sell food to the tourists that visited her area, but now there are very few of them.\r\n\r\nAt 47 years old her principal expenses are for herself and her home, since her four children are already grown and only the youngest, age 20, is still a student. Her income is joined by that of her husband, who is self-employed in construction.\r\n\r\nJulia has been receiving loans from EDAPROSPO for three years, and her plan for the future is to continue to develop her business, above all because newly planted avocados take five years before they begin to produce fruit.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kris Vickery, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":287507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase another small farm to be able to grow more avocados","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T15:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":160,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":32},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":32},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":32},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":32},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.99,"local_amount":32,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978485},{"amount":80.19,"local_amount":73.32,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-21T07:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":80.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439372},{"amount":59.82,"local_amount":54.68,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T15:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":59.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87027510}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T20:06:34Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T15:43:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"k vickery","image":389145}},{"id":99096,"name":"Alao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alao R. is 40 years old and married with 4 children.

It is amazing how many people have mobile phones in Tanzania. This is probably attributable to the fact that it is the only form of phone communication available to most people because there are few landlines and because mobile phones are relatively cheap here. \n\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, four days per week and is assisted by one employee.

Mwasiti thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":336787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

He is also engaged in livestock and his children help him with the business. His daily efforts and the care of his fields assure him a good harvest as well as profits.\r\n\r\nAsomidin has dreamed of extending his lands. He wants to obtain a loan to invest in his current land by purchasing seeds and fertilizer to earn greater profits and reach the goal he has set for himself.\r\n\r\nAsomidin thanks everyone supporting him and promises to repay the loan with no violations.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

R. is a 37-year-old woman who lives with her husband and three children in a community named Santa Fe, in Los Chiles, Alajuela province. This community lies in a mountainous zone very close to our country's northern border. The area's leading economic activities are ranching and farming, especially staple grains, sugar cane and oranges. \r\n\r\nWith the desire to improve her quality of life and that of her family, Norma was looking at various alternatives, and a little more than a year ago, she started a business: a bakery in which she offers different types of bread and especially homemade pastries. She says that the business has gone very well for her; she has enjoyed great acceptance in her community, since there had previously been no business providing this service.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Norma would like to request a loan of 623,000 colones in order to improve the infrastructure of the place where she bakes her bread. With this, she hopes that her microenterprise will grow and generate more income to raise her standard of living. \r\n\r\nNorma is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Manantial de Santa Fe (Santa Fe Springs Communal Credit Company), one of EDESA's 100 member organizations in Costa Rica.

He has been farming for 18 years. His farm produces vegetables, milk, maize, beans, potatoes and eggs, which he sells to the local market. Wanjohi is happy about his farming activities since he solely depends on the income from farming to cater for the needs of his family.\r\n\r\nWanjohi recently completed his fifth loan from Juhudi Kilimo and has requested this loan of 35,000 Kenyan Shillings to expand his poultry project. He says that the extra income he will earn will enable him to invest in other income-generating activities to supplement his income.

Nenita M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nNenita is shown in the accompanying picture with the rice grains she is sun-drying before she sends it to the rice mill for processing.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He and his wife, Elsa, are a team, working hard to make a better life for their 2 children: Angelo, 12, and Benjamin, just 15 days old.  They live in a house they own in a rural part of Yanapuquio.  Most people in the area make their living from farming.  Diomedes and his wife grow potatoes on a farm they have operated for 10 years.  Seeing his plants grow strong and healthy is what he likes best about farming because his earnings depend on the quality of his crop.  But Diomedes does more than just grow potatoes.  He also raises sheep and fattens them for a market in the city.  The market is 2 hours away but he uses the trip to sell his potato crop, as well.  He owns 2 burros that he uses to carry the heavy bags of potatoes he collects.  He's thinking now of opening a store, with help from his community bank, to sell clothing in a shop in the town.  For now, though, he's trying to get enough money together to improve his house.  Diomedes belongs to the \"Zona semillero de Yanapuquio\" community bank and this is his fifth MFP loan.  He likes bank meetings because they're opportunities to trade experiences.  He adds that he's grateful for all of the support that he's received from all of you in the past.  Diomedes will use part of this loan to buy a burro (who he plans to name \"Chato\"), which should cost around 300 new soles, and the rest to buy several head of sheep.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":854457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy farm animals for his farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-26T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diomedes ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":821.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835641}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T19:15:31Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":333510,"name":"Gladys  Ruth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cQORIMANCACHA\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito D.

It is composed of his life partner and his daughters. For Tomas the more important thing is his family. They are his principal source of inspiration to keep struggling day after day for a better future. He is an incredible man who, despite his age, is a tireless worker. Tomas is a transportation driver for both passengers and for cargo. He has many steady clients and each day there are more people who request his services. The most important thing for him is for his clients to be satisfied with the service he offers. This is the reason why he is always careful to have his vehicle in a good state of repair. Lately he has noticed the deterioration of his vehicle, especially because it is in constant use, and it requires maintenance. For the reason previously mentioned he has decided to request a loan from Integral (Kiva Field Partner).

She has been working embroidering clothes for the last year and a half.\r\n\r\nHer business is called \u201cBordado con Sentimiento\u201d (Embroidery with Feeling) because she writes poems, names and dedications on various articles of clothing according to the customer\u2019s wishes.  Some of these products are t-shirts and blankets.\r\n\r\nHowever, she comments that demand for her products and\/or services is irregular so it\u2019s not a good idea to only have this single business.  Therefore, she added to her services creating and making corporate logos for firms since these are produced at wholesale and are economically more convenient for her. M\u00f3nica publicizes her work through a blog she has on the Internet as well as providing her data to acquaintances and friends.  She buys her supplies in the Independencia and Estaci\u00f3n Central Communes. This loan is to buy t-shirts, thermal fabric and towels to embroider.  Her goal is to expand the business and to make progress with it.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica lives with her two children who are 18 and 13 years old.  Her dreams on a family level is that her children are able to make their projects reality.  Her daughter hopes to go to dental school at a state university so M\u00f3nica strives daily to generate new and better income to provide her children with the best possible economic wellbeing.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the loan provided by Fondo Esperanza because it will make it possible for her to invest in her business and generate higher profits.  She comments that the group in the communal bank she participates in is very strong and they share similar goals of building projects on a large scale and to be able to make them happen.\r\n\r\nIndependencia is one of the 34 communes that make up the city of Santiago (Capital of Chile) and is located in the center-north sector.  It arose at the end of the 19th-century as a traditional part of the city.  Its main axis is Independencia Avenue which used to be the ancient Road of the Inca which was the northern gate of the city of Santiago.  Because of its extensive indigenous population the Chilean Indigenous Cultural Center is found in Independencia.  It also has important historical buildings among which are six historical Chilean monuments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":899695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy t-shirts, thermal fabric and towels to embroider.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Independencia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-10-21T23:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3100,"lender_count":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"M\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joselyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chantal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicente","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1603200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":111650},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":104273},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":113120},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":110417},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":111473},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":112531},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":113604},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":114690},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":115793},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":116896},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":118003},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":119136},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120273},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":121341}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.89},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":201.63},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.73},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.55},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.6},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":219.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":221.77},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.9},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":226.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.56},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":215.89,"local_amount":111650,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:11:43Z","rounded_local_amount":111939.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238606953},{"amount":1067.01,"local_amount":551814,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:28Z","rounded_local_amount":553242.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244561321},{"amount":891.37,"local_amount":460983,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":462176.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250772316},{"amount":925.73,"local_amount":478753,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":479992.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257180763}],"funded_date":"2011-10-22T18:19:13Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:14:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":354026,"name":"Ibrahim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ibrahim is a 44-year-old married Lebanese man who lives with his wife and three children.

In addition, people place custom orders and she bakes for them, as these types of products are in high  demand. In small towns and villages, people often organize celebrations and fully serve the guests. For this reason, they often buy baked products. This helps them to save money and time. Currently, Karima has one oven, which is not enough. Lack of the second oven becomes a bottleneck and prevents her from producing more. <p>\r\nShe decided to purchase a large oven, and for that reason, is asking for a loan. The credit will help her increase the volume of production and sales. Karima will be able to collect earnings earlier than before.

His business is the family's main source of income. <P>As a rule, Sohibjon travels to the neighboring town of Khujand 2-3 times a month to purchase his goods. Sohibjon is trying to have a wide range of goods with good quality to meet the requirements of his customers and to satisfy the needs of customers with different levels of income. <P>Today, Sohibjon is requesting 3400 Somoni (US$ 1000) for a term of 12 months.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a member of Banco Comunal \"Madres Coraje\" and she owns and operates two moto-taxis. She has worked with Manuela Ramos for 2 years and 2 months and received her first loan in the amount of 300 Nuevos Soles.

With this new loan for 1000 Nuevos Soles, she will be able to purchase spare parts and properly maintain her two moto-taxis.

She decided to join the Fresno credit group because this group was formed with people from her own community which she knew and respected very much. The main investment of the majority of the members in this group is the cultivation of Hass avocado orchards where they want to cultivate new plants and renew or nourish those already established so that they yield more and better quality fruit. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe is 19 years old, is a happy girl that in spite of her young age has many dreams and goals. She studied in High School but now does not have the opportunity to continue her studies because of the distance to the school and the expense incurred by her parents of going to an institution of higher learning.  It has been several years since she developed an interest in starting a business that would permit her to obtain income. \r\n\r\nHer main desire is to start a fast food restaurant in the industrial zone of the city of Zitacuaro. She thinks that this is the right place to undertake her business activity because she has worked there for a year and noticed that the workers in the area look for places to eat nearby because they do not have enough time to go to the center of Zitacuaro or to their homes to eat. She has thought of using the credit to buy a table, a parasol, plates, glasses, a cast iron pan for grilling, raw materials and all that is necessary to begin this fast food business. Guadalupe visualizes a profitable business that offers clean, flavorful and economical food to her diners who will be mainly workers in the manufacturing zone. Additionally, she wants to support her parents economically so that her younger brothers have the option to study and so that her family improves their quality of life. \r\n\r\n<br

She is part of the \"Mujeres en Acci\u00f3n\" [Women in Action] group, which has 8 members. Her fellow group members elected her as the head of the group.  \r\n\r\nFor 6 years, Lizabeth has worked selling candy. A friend found her a place to park her mobile sales stand, which she purchased with her earnings. She also bought a small glass display case in order to show off her products. \r\n\r\nWith her earnings, Lizabeth has been able to make improvements to her home, but principally she has been able to increase her stock of candies, which in turn has allowed her to gain more customers and make better profits. \r\n\r\nLizabeth's current goal is to remodel part of her house to start a small grocery store. This will mean she does not have to sell in the street and will avoid being cold in the winter and getting too much sun in the summer. She will use this loan to buy candy and soft drinks for her store. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":575910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of candy for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Comas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-08-02T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lizabeth Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rubi Cindy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Gisella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Honoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edovigia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma Dina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":577},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":577},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":577},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":569}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.97},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.96},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.97},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":206.97,"local_amount":577,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:00:46Z","rounded_local_amount":583.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831582},{"amount":206.96,"local_amount":577,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":583.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098123},{"amount":206.97,"local_amount":577,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":583.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390792},{"amount":204.1,"local_amount":569,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":575.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529072}],"funded_date":"2010-08-05T23:18:26Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

She has three children: her elder daughter is nineteen, her elder son is sixteen and her younger daughter is twelve. Her elder daughter studies at the institution of higher education and her son and younger daughter go to school. Her husband is carpenter. Elmira sells honey. It was suggested by her aunt that she start selling honey in order to increase her income. Twenty years ago, Elmira bought honey and all necessary business supplies for 8,000 KGS and she earns about $195 monthly. She applied for a loan to buy a 200 liter kettle for the honey-making process. With the profits from selling honey, she plans to give her son a higher education and buy furniture for her house.\r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\nMarvarhan K. is the treasurer of the group. She is forty two and a widow. She has four children: her daughters are fifteen, thirteen and six and her son is ten years old. Her elder daughters and her son go to school and her youngest daughter is at home. Five years ago, Marvarhan received a loan from the micro-finance company \u201cFINCA\u201d in the amount of 5,000 KGS and bought honey. Then she resold that honey at a higher price. Now she gets about $175 monthly from selling honey. In order to increase her turnover she is applying for a loan because she doesn\u2019t have enough funds. \r\n\r\nSonaiym C. is forty-seven and married. She has four children: her daughters are twenty-three, twenty-one, and eighteen and her son is fourteen. Her elder daughter is a recent graduate and now is in search of employment opportunities. Her second and third daughters study at an institution of higher education, and her son goes to school. Her husband is a taxi driver. Nineteen years ago, Sonaiym was selling clothes when her friend suggested she switch to selling convenience goods. She bought some convenience goods for 30,000 KGS and started selling them. Now, she makes about $320 monthly. She has been able to buy an area already planted in a crop and to give her children an opportunity to study at the institution of higher education on the profits from her business. She is applying for a loan in order to get necessary funds for increasing the assortment of goods she sells. In the future, she plans to expand her business and buy a shop for her convenience goods. \r\n\r\nAizada A. is twenty-two and married. She has two sons: the elder is one year old and her younger son is eight months. Her husband is a computer administrator in a computer club. Aizada sells convenience goods at the local market or from home. In 2009, her neighbor offered her the chance to help in selling convenience goods, and then start selling on her own. She started with a purchase of goods for 25,000 KGS. Now she gets about $195 a month as an income from selling convenience goods. She is planning to increase the assortment but she doesn\u2019t have sufficient funds; therefore, she is applying for a loan. In the future, she is planning to build a shop near her house. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She has a small restaurant and makes and sells ice cream. She lives in Puerto Princesa, Palawan. Marissa has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \n\nBy working hard, Marissa is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 14,000. Marissa is borrowing PHP 19,500 so that she could increase the volume of food that she cooks every day as well as widen the variety of food choices for the people who eat at her small restaurant.

She sells shoes through catalogs and travels from house to house in order to visit friends and neighbors in her community.  Rosaura arrives at their homes to show them the catalogs.  She takes their orders and then requests the shoes.  Rosaura collects payment after the merchandise has been delivered.  She is an enthusiastic and friendly person, which helps her sell more shoes.  Rosaura needs this loan to invest in the purchase of shoes and catalogs so that she can make sales.

She lives with her husband who is supportive of her.  The house that they live in is theirs.  For four years she has been selling food (chicken soup) in a space that her children set up for her outside of their house.  She only sells her dish in the morning because it is in high demand during the early hours of the day because of its restorative properties.  The thing she likes most about her work is that many people savor the good flavor of her food.  Giving her customers a good product is very important for Zarela, since this determines whether customers return to her business.

This is the first time that she will have a loan with MFP and she is very excited to work with her community bank and to be very responsible in her repayments. The money she is requesting is for the purchase of an electronic scale to provide better service and more exact weight of the products she sells in bulk.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

The majority of the members are in the business of preparing meals for sale like chicken and special traditional dishes.  The rest of them sell CDs, provide in-home photography and videography services for special occasions, and some sell school and carpentry supplies.  All of these lines of work have heavy competition but the members have established solid reputations over the years selling dishes that people recognize and with the high quality of their ingredients.  The financing will be used to buy new supplies and work tools so that their work can be done faster and profits may be higher for the better well-being of their families.

Married to Prudencio C., who is retired, they are blessed with four children who are living their lives independently. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life. She has been selling newspapers for seven years.\r\n<p>\r\nCatalina has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than ten years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow from CCT\u2019s cooperative seven times. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed as additional capital for her business. Her business makes a profit of PHP 15,000 per month.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith your help, she would now like to apply for a PHP 15,000 loan.

Akoth. They have three children: Bridget, 8 years old, Cambeline, 6 years old, and Scoria, 4 years old. \r\n\r\nPeter owns a motorcycle which he uses in his business to transport people from Nyalenda to Kisumu town.

Nacaome is one of th hottest places in Honduras and people prefer to be comfortable with sandals..<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":584129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy clothing and sandals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Lorenzo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.416667 -87.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2010-08-17T13:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes Jeaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172173204},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177469229},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182607254},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T10:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189188980},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191484366},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195911162},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201353606},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206220168},{"amount":110,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:56:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2078.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211295346}],"funded_date":"2010-08-17T16:58:21Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:56:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":226987,"name":"Rosie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosie G. is from the town of Bunawan.

He doesn't have a house of his own because he lives with his father; it is on loan to him. Eusebio's wife gets along very well with her in-laws and she is very hard working. She is a housewife but she also works as a merchant selling undergarments for ladies and gentlemen in a plaza in San Felipe del Progreso. \r\n\r\nEusebio is a construction worker. He completed high school, and even though he is young there is no work for him. The only thing he was able to take up is construction, which is a trade that doesn't require training, but it is difficult work.  He only works when there is a contract for a house, a store, or a building in the Mexico City. \r\n\r\nEusebio has also been a merchant for many years. He sets out together with his wife to work on Sundays at the plaza in San Felipe del Progreso.  His wife sets up in one side selling undergarments and Eusebio sells shoes, and shoe care products, such as polish, brushes, dyes, as well as blenders. He also repairs blenders. \r\n\r\nThe difficult part about Eusebio's business is to keep his products away from the sun. If they are left in the sun the polishes expand or melt and the products won't sell. \r\n\r\nEusebio wants a better life for his family and a better education for his son. For this reason he wants to reach his goal of having his own merchandise. The greatest part of his merchandise is purchased with borrowed money.

Se caracteriza por la actividad agr\u00edcola, ganadera y artesana.\n\nJos\u00e9 se dedica a brindar servicio de transporte de carga de Tambogrande a Piura y viceversa, una zona donde predomina la agricultura. Para realizar su actividad cuenta con un cami\u00f3n, el cuales propio y sus principales clientes son los pobladores de la zona donde vive.

He owns the home where he lives with his wife and children.  His home has water and electricity and is located in the urban area of the Tambogrande District in the department of Piura.  He is known for his work in farming, ranching, and craftsmanship.\r\n\r\nFor a living, Jos\u00e9 transports cargo from Tambogrande to Piura and vice versa.  This area is mainly used for agriculture.  In order to do his work, he relies on his truck, which he owns.  His main customers are the people who live in his neighborhood.

She'll rush right out and invest this loan in yarn and embroidery thread. This is her first loan of her life, and having a bit of capital to buy the raw materials will be an amazing experience. \r\n<p>\r\nMatilde is married and has a little 9-month-old. Right now she and her husband rent a plot of about 20 by 40 meters to grow the corn that they use as their primary food, but she dreams of actually buying a plot of her own, which would cost as much as $1000. And someday she dreams of  constructing a house too. \r\n<p>\r\nMatilde, like several other women in her village, reports that the children under age 2 are very regularly sick, with fevers, headaches, and stomach aches.

Mahmadsaid started by selling a small number of products but now he has an extensive stock and has enlarged the store to take up the whole front of his home. His children have helped out; his family unit has been  instrumental in developing and growing his business.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 41 years old and the mother of two small children who have depended on her since her husband abandoned her.  She has learned to be a single mother with a desire to come out ahead by being responsible, dynamic, and active.\r\n\r\nIt all began six years ago, when Yobana felt the need to start her own business, independent from that of her, then, husband.  This is when she learned of EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD.  Thanks to the loan she received, she was able to start her own business selling cylinders of gas for cooking, which she transported and delivered.  This is not a job that can be done by just ANY woman.\r\n\r\nYobana then requested additional loans through EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD, which allowed her to open another one of her businesses.  Little by little she opened a small grocery shop in her home, which she runs with the help of her children.\r\n\r\nAnother one of her business, which she calls a hobby, is teaching girls to play volleyball.  She is very passionate about this sport and rarely misses the opportunity to play on the weekends.\r\n\r\nShe also sells Esika beauty products, which she promotes within her other businesses; to her gas customers, to her neighbors from her grocery shop, and to her fellow volleyball players.\r\n\r\nYobana has gotten a lot from her efforts, like being able to pay for her children\u2019s education, having her own shop in her home, and being able to give her children all that she could give them with all her heart.  One of her dreams is to have a large store where she can sell anything she thinks of.  She will not fail because she will give her all to get what she desires.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":491291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Provide working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Juan de Lurigancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-02-20T16:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel Yobana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":67.95},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":63.68},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":73.47},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":77.41},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":79.91},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":87.52},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":92.19},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":96.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100.36},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":104.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.48},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.03},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.97},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.5,"local_amount":68,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":72.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933818},{"amount":24,"local_amount":64,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":68.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661411},{"amount":27.75,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":78.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694071},{"amount":27.38,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":77.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877035},{"amount":28.88,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":82.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617017},{"amount":30,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":85.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831389},{"amount":31.1,"local_amount":82.95,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":88.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172097997},{"amount":33.02,"local_amount":88.05,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":93.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390701},{"amount":34.5,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":98.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529007},{"amount":35.99,"local_amount":95.99,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":102.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665156},{"amount":37.88,"local_amount":101.01,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":107.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408482},{"amount":39,"local_amount":104,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":111,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826817}],"funded_date":"2010-02-20T17:38:37Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:36:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Edina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from ASKI. Edina is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. This will be the fifth loan taken out by Edina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

ventures: buying and selling livestock (pigs, goats, and cows) and operating a food vending business. She lives in the Sambag zone of Jonobjonob village, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. \n\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard at her livestock trading and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP 4,000 per month.\n\nLenatte is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can buy more livestock. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lenatte aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \n\nAbout NWTF:  \n\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":559651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She is 39 years old, married, and has four school-aged children. To make a living, she buys and sells dried fish and shrimp in the local community. Lina has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately $82 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Lina is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 3rd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

He makes and sells 'arroz de lisa' (a rice and fish dish).  This dish is a typical Barranquillera dish and is made with 'lisa', a sea fish which lays its eggs in brackish water such as river mouths.  Jos\u00e9 Alberto also sells 'bu\u00f1uelos' (a type of fritter), empanadas (stuffed pastries), 'deditos' (cheese fingers) and other delicacies that he prepares together with his wife and then transports on his three-wheeled vehicle which he acquired with his first loan from our foundation.  Thanks to our organization, Jos\u00e9 Alberto has managed to grow in his business and gradually fill his display case, his cooking pots and his soft drinks cooler.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Alberto's main customers are neighbors in his own community where he has a captive market as he is located in a bus and mototaxi station and this is where his main customers are found.  Jos\u00e9 Alberto started this business two years ago after changing his business activity.  He used to hand-make and sell ladies' footwear but that business had a long production process and he made minimal profits.  For this reason, when he decided to join our foundation, he took advantage of the situation and changed his business to something which he knew and which was profitable.  Through his loans, he has managed to stabilize his business and he plans, in the future, to buy a cooler in which to keep his fish and meat.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Jos\u00e9 Alberto's third loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he will use it to buy supplies such as rice, meat, cheese, flour and sugar wholesale.  His financial indicators show his accounts receivable turnover period at 1 day, his raw material turnover period at 2 days and his profits at 27%.  With this new investment, he plans to earn discounts by purchasing his supplies in larger quantities before new prices go into effect at the beginning of the year."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":699763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

It is a modest home that she shares with her 4 children and her long-term partner. Juliane has been living in the country for several years, ever since she emigrated to the Dominica. She is currently in receipt of her 8th loan with Esperanza (Kiva Field Partner).
