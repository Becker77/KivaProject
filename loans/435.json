The civil war, which took place soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., severely damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in agricultural production and the manufacturing sector.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  All of these factors have resulted in a severe lack of jobs and have forced hundreds of thousands to leave Tajikistan to find work in other countries, mostly in Russia.  While Tajikistan has experienced some economic growth since the end of the Civil War, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON International's mission is to promote sustainable economic development and improved quality of life in Tajikistan by insuring reliable access to financial services for the economically active members of the population. IMON International has 8 branch offices throughout Tajikistan and their entrepreneurs work in many parts of the country's economic sector including trade, manufacturing, agriculture, and services. As of  October 2008, IMON International had 27,802 active clients and a total portfolio of $28,405,549.  Approximately 44% of these clients are women and 65% are from rural areas.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.  On the other end of the spectrum, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and thus only 7% of the land is arable; accordingly, this confluence of factors has resulted in high levels of unemployment and has forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries (primarily Russia).  Even though the people of Tajikistan are working hard to improve the country's agriculture and manufacturing sectors, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON International's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Nelly's greatest desire is to give a good life to her children.  Two blocks from the main plaza of Nu\u00f1oa (district of the province of Melgar and the department of Puno) is Nelly's grocery store.  It is very popular with people of her neighborhood because she is a saleswoman very pleasant and kind and always greets her customers with a smile.  She enjoys selling very much and has the ability and the patience to do so.  She has done this work for seven years and feels that the most difficult part of her work is being confined inside the store all day.  In the near future, Nelly hopes that her business grows and that the number of products she offers increases, so she can increase her income.  This is her second loan from Microfinanzas PRISMA, and she feels a responsibility to make her payments on time.  To make timely payments, she must save a little every day from her earnings.  She is a very active and supportive member of her village bank, which has earned her the respect of her peers.

She is a woman with clear foresight of the future of her family.\r\n\r\nIt is more than a decade already that Marites has been running the fishing business but, due to insufficient capital, sometimes she encounters problems regarding her business needs. In 2009, she decided to join ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, with hopes of getting access to capital for her dying business. When she received her first loan, she invested it in her fishing business. It was successful and the business now brings her a good income to sustain the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nMarites has a fish cage where she cultures small fish until they are ready to harvest and sell in the market. She has regular customers already and sometimes she roams around the village and even in the market to sell fish.\r\n\r\nNow on her 2nd loan, she proposes a loan of 10,000 PHP as additional capital for her fishing business. The amount will be used to pay for a bundle of fishnet, fifty pieces of bamboo and payment for the labor of making the fish cage. She hopes to expand her business and be able to save for the future of her children, especially their school needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":396118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Later, she quickly makes her way to the food court in the city's educational center, where she sells chicken sandwiches, sweets, and sodas, among other food items. With her charisma, she is able to convince even the most reluctant of customers to buy from her stand. Celia works with another member of her community bank, who is ready to leave her with the business, and Celia is waiting eagerly for this to happen.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, she sells different seasonal products. For example, the month of October went very well due to sales of turrones (a nougat candy made with a base of cookies and honey), which are traditionally eaten during this season.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she anticipates selling panetones (cake with raisins and fruit) during the Christmas season. She has mentioned this to her customers and already has orders, so she is sure her sales will be strong. She plans to save money to open a grocery store in her house, as well.\r\n\r\nThis is the tenth loan she will receive from MFP and she is sure to be punctual in paying each one of her loan payments. In addition, she is well respected within her community bank because she likes to actively participate in the meetings. With the money she is requesting she will buy panetones at wholesale prices to fill the orders her relatives and friends have already placed.

She is a 33-year-old single mother of two children.  The first is 13, and the second is 4 years old.  Both go to school.  She takes care of her mother, who lives in Maputo, by sending her 500 meticales monthly.  She can't save anything because she lives in a rented house.\r\n\r\nCristina moved to the village of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland when her husband abandoned her.  That same year she began her studies while living in her grandparents' house because her mother could not support her.  When she was in eighth grade, she became pregnant with her first daughter and was kicked out of the house, but since she understood salon work, her aunt invited Cristina to work together with her.  Some years later she chose to open her own beauty salon with the money she had saved, and she approached Banco Novo (another banking institution) asking for a loan of 20,000 meticales to strengthen her business.  She paid it off with no problems, but her business didn't earn enough because she had to rent the shop.  Some years later she managed to get a job as an assistant in a botany lab, working from 7:30 am until 3:30 pm and earning 1,825 meticales.  She had no time to take care of her business, so she employed someone, which left her bankrupt.  These days she does beauty work in her house on Saturdays and Sundays because of the demand she has had, and she sells a variety of clothing acquired in South Africa at the Shoprite informal market.\r\n\r\nThis is Cristina's fourth loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva. The first two loans (for 4,500 meticales and 8,000 meticales) were used to increase her stock of beauty products, and the third for 12,000 meticales was used for the same purpose.  These 15,000 meticales will be used to buy a variety of clothing sold by pre-order.  She is confident that she will pay it back ahead of time and ask for another loan to build her own beauty salon.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

Arifwala is famous in Pakistan for its dairy industry. She has been living in a two-room brick house with her family for many years. She is 53 years old and married to M. A. who is a property dealer by profession. She is the mother of two sons and two daughters. Both her sons left their education due to financial constraints and started working to contribute to their family financially. Her elder son works in a factory and the younger one works as a laborer. Her daughters are continuing their education and are reading at 9th and 10th standards respectively. \r\n\r\nHaneefan supports her family by sewing and has regular orders from her neighboring clients. She also has a dairy business which she prefers. The reason for liking this business is because her parents are also in the same business and she used to take care of their cattle. Currently, she has a buffalo at her home which produces almost 8 kg of milk per day. She sells the milk to community members and uses this income to pay for the utilities expenses for her house. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, Asasah, for her dairy business. With the loan amount, she will buy another buffalo and increase her dairy business's productivity. Haneefan is a regular borrower from Asasah and this is her fifth loan application. With her previous loans, she has shown that she is a responsible person, having paid her installments on time and never missing a meeting.\r\n   \r\nNote: In this photo, Haneefan is the lady who is holding a book (the Asasah Passbook) in her hand.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":609880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In order to provide for his family and live in a healthy environment, he began a small business dealing in household goods and appliances. Fourteen years ago, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, he was a salesperson on the streets and imported goods from nearby regions. Gradually, he was able to build up his business and started renting a sales point. Muazzan wants to expand the business and maximize his profits.

Being very enterprising and courageous in commercial matters, she decided to specialize in the production and sale of biscuits. She began this occupation twenty years ago; today, she enjoys a good reputation and a loyal and growing client base. To meet this growing demand, she approached the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution to obtain additional financial resources. With this loan, she intends to purchase five sacks of wheat flour, four drums of oil and three sacks of sugar. The flour is mixed with water and sugar in a cup; this dough is then rolled into balls and cooked in oil. \r\nShe purchases her raw materials from shopkeepers at the central market in Sikasso, and sells her wares retail in the same market, for cash and occasionally on credit. Her clientele is made up mainly of women, of stallkeepers and of other people working in the market. Madame Koura B. foresees a monthly profit of 30,000 CFA francs.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":227615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To increase vitenge and kanga in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T11:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonesia M.

She is married and has two children who are 12 and 13 years old and are currently studying in pursuit of a better future. Her husband works as a taxi driver, and finds the work tiring because sometimes his routes don't pay well due to the economic crisis the country is currently facing. People prefer to pay 2.50 c\u00f3rdobas - what a ride costs in the city of Managua - and don't want to pay taxi rides that cost 40 c\u00f3rdobas, since that is the money they need to buy food each day. \r\n\r\nYadira has been selling clothing and shoes for the past 5 years, and she often has low sales. She makes most of her sales on payday, and this way she makes up for the rest of the month. She started taking out loans through a village bank, and thus was able to invest in her business. With this loan, she will buy a variety of clothing for men, women and children to satisfy her clients' demand, since November and the Christmas season are her best times for sales. She hopes to earn good profits so that she can continue to invest in her business. She is grateful to Afodenic for giving her this opportunity to take out a loan. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":417142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy clothing for men, women and children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:01:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yadira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.99,"local_amount":1639.71,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:57:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1694.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601712},{"amount":40.64,"local_amount":812.77,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:02Z","rounded_local_amount":839.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003157},{"amount":80.39,"local_amount":1607.71,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1661.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874228},{"amount":39.67,"local_amount":793.41,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":819.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639591},{"amount":40.48,"local_amount":809.6,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":836.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821366},{"amount":40.34,"local_amount":806.8,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":833.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561382},{"amount":76.49,"local_amount":1530,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1580.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770347}],"funded_date":"2009-11-12T22:42:09Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":152973,"name":"Merlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlinda E. runs a poultry business in her village.

For the past 20 years he has worked weekends as the master of ceremonies for an orchestra in the city of Ferre\u00f1afe.

Jhony is requesting help from Edpyme Alternativa for the first time.  He needs 1000 new soles to buy metal sheeting to build a roof for his house because the continuous rains of last year greatly weakened his present roof and it will not stand up to the rains this Summer.  Jhony is a responsible, very cheerful and helpful father.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her variety store, buying and selling (charcoal) and livestock businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000. Annabelle is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can continue to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Annabelle aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

muy alegre y trabajador, convive con Francisca de 30 a\u00f1os y fruto de su relaci\u00f3n hoy tienen 03 hijos y  juntos viven en su propia casa, situados en la comunidad de Carmen Pampa, caser\u00edo del distrito de San Francisco. Jonny es el pilar de su familia, desde muy ni\u00f1o sus padres le inculcaron a remover la tierra y hoy es todo un conocedor del arduo labor en el agro; es campesino y cuenta con 03 hect\u00e1reas de terreno cultivados con plantas de caf\u00e9, cacao y pl\u00e1tano; plantas oriundas de la zona selv\u00e1tica del Valle R\u00edo Apurimac. Viene removiendo la tierra hace 12 a\u00f1os en su propia parcela, en tiempos de cosecha cuenta con el apoyo de los peones quienes se encargan de cosechar y trasladar los frutos hasta los tendales. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cosechar los frutos de las plantas; ya que as\u00ed siente que los meses de arduo trabajo le brindan como recompensa la calidad de sus frutos. Considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus productos desde su comunidad hasta los centros de acopio ubicados en los distritos de Kimbiri y San Francisco; lugares donde le ofrecen mejores precios por sus productos. Su dificultad radica en no poder contar con suficiente ingreso econ\u00f3mico para solventar los pagos por adelantado a los jornaleros quienes le brindan el apoyo en las cosechas y sacar la maleza; es por ello que acude a los cr\u00e9ditos que facilita la Instituci\u00f3n MFP. Pero ahora lo que m\u00e1s prioriza es sembrar m\u00e1s plantas de caf\u00e9 ya que cuenta con 01 hect\u00e1rea de terreno no cultivado. Este es su primer cr\u00e9dito de Jonny con MFP, esta dispuesto cumplir con sus respectivos pagos ya que desea acceder a otro cr\u00e9dito posteriormente. A la vez se siente muy agradecido con la instituci\u00f3n por  concederle el cr\u00e9dito. Con los 3,000 nuevos soles solicitados, contratar\u00e1 jornaleros para que le brinden el apoyo en las cosechas y sacar la maleza.\n\n","en":"Jonny is from the town of San Francisco.  He is 35 years old and a very happy and hard-working young man.  He lives with his partner, 30 year-old Francisca, and they have 3 children together.  They live in their own home which is located in Carmen Pampa, a small village in San Francisco district.\r\n\r\nJonny is the pillar of his family.  His parents taught him to grow crops from a very early age and today he is an expert in the hard slog that is farming.  Jonny is a farmer and he owns 3 hectares of land where he grows coffee, cacao and bananas.  These are all plants which are native to the rainforest area of the Apurimac Valley where he lives.  Jonny has been farming his own plot of land for 12 years.  At harvest times he is helped by laborers who harvest his crops and transport them to drying areas.\r\n\r\nWhat Jonny most enjoys about his work is harvesting his crops since this is when he feels that all his hard work is being rewarded through the quality of his fruit.  He considers that the most difficult part of his work is transporting his products from his community to the warehouses in Kimbiri and San Francisco districts.  This is where they offer him the best prices for his products.  Jonny's problem is that he doesn't have enough money to pay his laborers, who support him in his harvests and in weeding his crops, in advance.  For this reason, he takes loans from MFP.  However, right now his priority is growing more coffee plants since he has 1 hectare of land that is not cultivated.\r\n\r\nThis is Jonny's first loan from MFP.  He is prepared to make his repayments on time since he would like to access further loans in the future.  He is very grateful to the institution for granting him this loan.  Jonny will use the 3,000 Peruvian soles that he has requested to hire laborers to support him in his harvests and in weeding his land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":737540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire laborers to support him in his harvests and in weeding his land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-24T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonny ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":326.21},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":347.93},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":354.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":366.99},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":382.18},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":394.1},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":409.35},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":419.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.61},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.57},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.87},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.51},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.09},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":140.02,"local_amount":381.87,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":389.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196423},{"amount":148.63,"local_amount":405.36,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":413.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270106},{"amount":153.83,"local_amount":419.55,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":427.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550121},{"amount":70.44,"local_amount":192.11,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":195.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718797},{"amount":138.82,"local_amount":378.59,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":386.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350263},{"amount":144.51,"local_amount":394.1,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":402.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850745},{"amount":150.09,"local_amount":409.35,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":417.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665931},{"amount":153.66,"local_amount":419.07,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:43Z","rounded_local_amount":427.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621095}],"funded_date":"2011-03-25T15:08:38Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":288893,"name":"Ibrahim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ibrahim is a 26 years old married man, living with his wife in Bint Jbeil.

Liliana says that after the first few gatherings, the 15 women interested in taking part in the program were left, and since that is the minimum amount of members required, they were able to formally begin the committee, which is named Mujeres Emprendedoras de Santa Ana (Entrepreneurial Women of Santa Ana) and today is one of the longest-standing committees.\r\n\r\n<P>Currently, they find themselves in the middle of a project for the month of June due to the San Juan festivities, where they hold fairs with typical dishes and traditional games, such as the one with the guaran\u00ed name of \u201cTata ari jehasa,\u201d with the objective of raising funds to strengthen the committee\u2019s internal savings.\r\n\r\n<P>The loans they will receive will be invested in the purchase of ingredients used in the making of chipas such as starch, oil and cheese, as well as the purchase of herbs, sugar and sodas.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She had no experience in the cleaning industry, but fell into it when a friend asked her if she wanted to earn some extra money by helping a family member paint his house. The homeowner was so impressed by her work that he asked for her housekeeping help on a regular basis\r\n\r\nIn the last year, Tan has quickly built a base of 20 clients for her residential janitorial service business, Maid By Me, and has developed a following on Yelp.com. Tan differentiates her business by using only natural cleaning products like baking soda, vinegar, steam, and lemons. She loves a challenge now and then, like carpet stains, candle wax, and hard water deposit removal. She prides herself in not leaving anything unfinished.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Tan does not have the equipment or staff to service more than three houses a day, and has to turn down clients. Her lack of credit history made her ineligible for a bank loan or a credit card. She is grateful for a $2,000 loan from Opportunity Fund, which she will use to purchase two heavy-duty vacuums, cleaning supplies, and an outdoor storage container. \r\n\r\nTan has one dedicated full-time employee, and in the future would like the ability to add to her staff so she can take on more of a business management role. \r\n\r\nShe says, \u201cOne day when I expand, my staff will clean as I do...no exceptions!  I\u2019ve been running the show for about a year and a half now with much success. Success in my definition is keeping my clients happy--not just satisfied.\u201d  \r\n\r\nLearn more on the Maid by Me website at http:\/\/www.creamofthecrops.toesinthegrass.info\/html\/maid_by_me.html

However, she had to leave the factory because her mother passed away and there was no one to look after the children while she went to work.

The problem is that she requires a valve operation on her heart, and for this she will need blood donors.

Adelina is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each of the group receives an individual loan, they are each responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if she is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 'Adelina V.\u2019s Group'. \n\t\nAdelina is married to Alejandro V., her business partner. They are blessed with 4 children;and now they are all in adult-aged. The couple decided to engage in business by operating a charcoal retail.  For 20 years already, the couple has been able to manage these businesses and now they are earning an average net income of not less than P 6,000 a month, which is very helpful as their family income.\n\nMrs. V. joined the cooperative in the year 2009. As an active member of the PDP-LP (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People) of PAGLAUM MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she is requesting the amount of P 7,000 as her 2nd loan for the purpose of purchasing additional charcoal to sell. The future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions for her family, to meet their basic needs, as savings for future use, and for children\u2019s education. She is hoping that someday her business will become more progressive.\n\nAbout PMPC: \n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":533081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

She inherited the store; her grandmother owned it, then it passed to her mother, and now it's hers.  Before taking over the store C\u00e1ndida was a dental assistant.  At nineteen she was working in a dental practice doing fillings.  After a while she took over the store completely and that's how she got to be a storekeeper, but she hasn't left the dental office, so she's got the two jobs.  She provided college educations to nearly all of her children; two of them are still finishing school.  She has the store in her house and her youngest daughter helps her operate it.\r\n\r\nC\u00e1ndida is seeking a loan to stock up the store and to buy dental supplies.  She hopes the investment will help her improve sales and grow her income.  Her next goal is to buy two new display cases to put her products in, as well as new windows since the ones she has are old and in bad shape. She would like to make her store a distribution

Es un vocablo del mapudungun (lengua mapuche) que se traduce como \u201clugar donde se juntan las aguas\u201d o \u201clugar de charcos\u201d, debido a que posee una variada red fluvial compuesta por el r\u00edo Mapocho y los esteros Lampa, Car\u00e9n y Las Cruces, lo que favorece sus suelos para la producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola por la existencia de abundante agua subterr\u00e1nea.\n","en":"Margarita is part of the communal  bank \"Amaican\" in Pudahuel, in the city of Santiago. She sews clothing for the home, such as tablecloths and curtains. She makes a certain amount of clothing, stores them in individual bags and then travels around the area where she lives to sell what she has made. To her older clients she offers credit facilities. Her workshop is located in her own home where she has worked for the last 13 years. Margarita says that before becoming a seamstress, she was a cooking teacher at a food store. However, due to health reasons she had to change direction. However she was operated on 2 years ago and now only has to undergo treatment and checkups. She works Monday through Friday in the afternoons and spends her weekends selling her products.  \r\n\r\nShe buys her consumables in the town of Independencia as the prices are inexpensive. With the loan she will buy an overlock sewing machine and fabric with which to run her sewing business. The remainder of the loan she will use to buy paraffin as she will make the most of the winter season to sell. \r\n\r\nHer business goal is to set up her business in a permanent location to offer and sell her sewing products. This would give her great peace of mind and be good for her health. Margarita lives with her son who is 28 years old and depends on others for work. Her dreams at a personal level are to rebuild her home with solid materials to keep them warm during the winter. Her house is located on a piece of land that was given to her. Another of her dreams is to help the less fortunate on a voluntary basis: she already prepares lunches at an open house for the aged. \r\n\r\nMargarita is very happy and thankful for the loans and services provided by Fondo Esperanza. Thanks to the training sessions given at the meetings of the communal bank group she has been better able to organize and administer her business. She says that the interpersonal relationships within the group are very good. The group is very united and undertakes diverse activities which encourage these good relationships. Pudahuel is a community in the western sector of Santiago (the capital of Chile), a metropolitan district. The name comes from the word magpudungun (from the Mapuche language) which means a \"place where the waters meet\" or  \"place of puddles\". because it has a diverse river network, comprising of the Mapocho river and the Lampa, Caren and Las Cruces streams which make the land here a good place for agriculture due to the abundance of underground water.\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":865575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy an overlock sewing machine and fabric with which to run her sewing business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Pudahuel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T14:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":300601,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":15949},{"due_date":"2011-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":17742},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":17912},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":18083},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":18256},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":18430},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":18606},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":18784},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":18963},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":19144},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":19165},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":19646},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":19698},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":19886},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":20076},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":20261}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.84},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.22},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.99},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.39},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.18},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.58},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.99},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.03},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.12},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.65},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.08},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":238.86,"local_amount":106372,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":109910.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232795998},{"amount":169.53,"local_amount":75497,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":78008.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238606919},{"amount":221.11,"local_amount":98471,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":101746.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244561287},{"amount":45.5,"local_amount":20261,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":20935.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250772282}],"funded_date":"2011-09-14T21:46:15Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":338098,"name":"Cangrehilla Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ritchel is married with one child.

She is a single mother with three children. \r\n\r\nShe is a fighter and has been in the business of making pupusas (tortilla rellenas). She says she began in this field by working for someone else, and it was there she learned to make pupusas. But Maria is a visionary and she wants to have her own business for which she declares that she needs to build a little caf\u00e9 where she could prepare and sell them. \r\n\r\nBefore Maria learned to make pupusas, she worked as a day laborer at a coffee plantation, harvesting coffee, cleaning, and pruning and doing other miscellaneous chores. Today she has the objective of getting her caf\u00e9 and this is the reason she is asking for a loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, in order to buy cement, sand, blocks and to pay to have the work done to build the caf\u00e9 and also in order to buy supplies to make her pupusas and to stock the caf\u00e9 and to have more products to offer her customers. She has already seen a great opportunity to earn a good income because nobody else is selling pupusas in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn this way she could give her children a higher standard of living and she would create a culture of saving, since the income that she earns would improve their house from constructing an extra room where her children could continue with their studies. \r\n\r\nMaria says she plans to continue working with Fundaci\u00f3n Campo. Her dream is to have a strong business with higher income and at the same time continue working harvesting coffee, as the season is approaching, and in this way have another source of

Jenina is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kamwenge in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has two children. For the past three years, Jenina has been working hard to manage her small grocery store, which sells dry foods like maize and coffee. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jenina has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more food and supplies, and will help Jenina to generate greater profits and improve her family's quality of life. Jenina hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house. \r\n\r\nJenina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Jenina's future prospects by helping her to learn how to take care of customers.

Honorine lives together with her husband and their children. Together, the couple meet the costs for their household expenses. In order to meet these expenses, Tatiana sells corn gruel on the street. She has done this for the last 10 years throughout the local area. In order to further strengthen their buying power and better satisfy client demand, Honorine and the other members of the Jesugnon-Ayimlonfide Group are requesting their third loan from Alid\u00e9. Their previous loans have been paid back in full."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1580041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

G. is 43 years old. She is married and has three children and lives in the Kibera slums. Monica also takes care of her nephew from Meru since the harsh conditions back in the rural part of the country he is from do not allow him to get a stable job.\r\n\r\nMonica\u2019s motivation to involve herself in the business of spinning wool was influenced by her mother who was an expert in that trade. Monica then decided to learn more and went through two months of training from her neighbor whom her mother had employed. Her mother could not train her since she was always busy delivering orders from clients. \r\n\r\nHaving been equipped with the necessary skills, Monica decided to start her own business in the year 1993. This was after she got married and the business helped in sustaining her family since at this time, she was living with her mother-in \u2013law, who also helped her to buy a spinning machine for her business. She struggled to bring up her business until she was able to save Ksh 3,000.00 (USD 45) with which she added an electric machine to her business, to help with the spinning, since it could do the work faster. G. goes to Nakuru once every month, and buys wool weighing 150-200kgs. She has so far been able to employ three workers who help in combing the wool after which Monica spins it into thread ready for sale. She sells the thread in different areas because she has customers as far as Ongata Rongai, Kikuyu and Limuru (regions within the country). She usually combs about 7kgs of wool per week.

Vazira is standing on the left side and Ibodat is on the right.\r\nVazira is a market vendor. She started her business ten years ago with only a few products, but her business is currently more stable. Vazira sells fruits and vegetables, such as apricots, apples, strawberries, tomatoes, cucumbers, and many others. Her sons help Vazira with the business. Vazira begins her workday early each morning at 5:00 a.m. In practice, she buys fruits and vegetables from the local farmers, and she then sells such produce in the market, where she is well-known by customers for her friendliness and because she sells her fruits and vegetables for affordable prices. As a result, Vazira\u2019s business generates a stable yet considerable income for her family. <p>\r\nNow is the prime season in which to sell fruits and vegetables, and her goods are (not surprisingly) in high demand. For this reason, she is seeking to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables in order to re-stock her store and to thereby expand her business. Accordingly, she is requesting a loan in the amount of 1,500 Somoni ($450), which she will repay in 8 months. In turn, she hopes to generate additional income in order to pay for her children\u2019s university fees and, with your help, this will be possible.

Mrs. Phon R. is the village bank president. She is a 50-year-old mother of two children: one of whom is a construction worker, while the youngest is enrolled in the local school. She is also a farmer who owns a two hectare field. She faces a small problem in her plantation, because she does not have enough money to hire a laborer with two oxen to plow her field. Thus, she is requesting a loan in order to pay for this service. With the remainder of the loan, she will buy fertilizers and pesticides to support her crops and make them more productive. Her husband, Mr. Leng Luy, helps his wife on the plantation. The five men shown in the picture above are representing their wives, who are also requesting loans, but who were busy at work and unable to have their photo taken.\r\n \r\n<p>This is a village bank loan consisting entirely of end-of-term loans. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product, because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor.

These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the veR. end of the loan term; but most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

She also sells drinks.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land.<P> \r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Henriette H. has requested a loan of 110,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":237946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-02-11T11:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Henriette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":27500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":29025.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357838},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046888},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938506},{"amount":73.64,"local_amount":36000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":37997.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396171},{"amount":10.74,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5541.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904049},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126057}],"funded_date":"2009-02-11T17:06:19Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83212,"name":"Epifania","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Epifania S., 34, is married with 3 children.

Zuharla S. is a 39 year old trader. She believes in hard work and dedication as the primary antidote to minimizing poverty and for that matter she is very serious with her business. She trades in cereals like maize. \r\n\r\nZuharla started this business when she moved from the northern region. Zuharla has remained in this business for the past four years now.  Through this Zuharla has been very resourceful for her family. She wants to use the loan to buy a larger supply of maize to serve her customers throughout the season. Especially in the face of increasing prices due to the current food crisis in the country. She believes with the loan she can buy more bags of maize grains from the farmers, avoiding middlemen who retail to her at a higher price.\r\n\r\nZuharla belongs to a village bank called \u2018Agnes\u2019. She also hope to receive GH\u00a2400 to make business progress by restocking her inventory. This would enable her to save more to support her husband in taking care of their home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":265939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Odil is 49 years old.  He is married with four children.  \r\n\r\nFrom the time he was young, Odil began learning to work in the small business with his parents.  With a lot of sacrifice, he became a main producer in agriculture in the area where he lived.  After he married, he continued working in the same business, watching the business grow as a result of his sacrifice, and seeing his family progressing more and more. \r\n\r\nHis hope is to continue growing and improving his business to offer a better future for his children and see them become professional, ethical and hardworking.  For this reason he is asking for a loan of $800 for a term of 12 months.  He wants this loan to buy additional livestock. \r\n\r\nBe an important part of the growth of Odil\u2019s business.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Su mayor anhelo es tener su casa donde ella y su futura familia puedan vivir tranquilos y felices.\n","en":"Leonor is 30 years old and lives with her husband in the home of her in-laws, located in the  La Uni\u00f3n district of Piura province, in the Piura region, 3 hours from the city of Chiclayo, the capital of the Lambayeque region.\r\n\r\nShe has a business selling chicha (a drink that is typical of the region) and beer from the home where she currently resides.  She prepares the chicha herself and offers it to her customers.  This business provides helpful income in addition to that earned by her husband, since they are both saving money to build their own house.\r\n\r\nChicha is a drink that is often consumed in Peru, it is made with a specific kind of corn, and is widely consumed by the people who live in the rural areas, since they believe that it gives them energy to continue with their work.\r\n\r\nLeonor wishes to expand her business with the purchase of supplies to make chicha (corn and firewood), and also with the purchase of more beer.  For this reason she requests a loan for the first time with Edpyme Alternativa for 1,000 Peruvian soles.\r\n\r\nLeonor is a very responsible woman who is held in high regard by her neighbors and customers.  Her main desire is to have her own house where she and her future family can live tranquilly and happily.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

He grew up with agriculture, and his parents did the same work and he still works planting seeds. He grows seasonal crops on his land, working with the crops until it is time to harvest them.

Yusup will buy seeds and fertilizers for his land with this loan.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Wangnime of Hetin Sota, located near the hot springs of Dangbo. She also sells corn (maize) and flour.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land. <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Jeanne A. has requested a loan of 120,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":237965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-01-13T05:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeanne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821571},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357843},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046893},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":31500,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:43Z","rounded_local_amount":33863.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938511},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":28500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":30638.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904054},{"amount":31.26,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126062}],"funded_date":"2009-01-13T08:53:33Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83228,"name":"Siu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Siu T., 67, is married with 6 children.

With all this effort, it is possible to obtain a good harvest and sell the products, with the aim of offering her three children an education and personal development appropriate to their age. This hard work also prompts her to think of opening a grocery store in her house, thus providing a larger share of income for the family\u2019s kitty. However, this will require a larger investment, and so with this object in mind Shoira is asking for your help in order to obtain the amount asked for to invest in the purchase of a larger quantity of seeds and fertilizer.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A., 29, lives in the La Playa urban zone.  She rents washing machines and offers Internet, transcription, printing and photocopying services.  She\u2019s married and has two children who are 6 and 9 years of age.\r\n\r\nThree years ago she became interested in having a business in addition to the fast-food business she\u2019d been involved with to date.  This is how she installed the laundry service buying first one machine then two additional ones precisely with the loan she got from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo in 2008.  She has been a client of this organization for two years and six months ago decided to buy a computer with her own resources to open a new Internet service.  In addition, she bought a printer and a photocopier. \r\n\r\nThus Aracelys has been constantly opening up new venues in her service infrastructure for which there is growing demand.  She has, therefore, decided to buy more equipment and move to a location that is near her home in order to expand even more.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a valued employee at a private firm and together they have built all they now have for their family\u2019s wellbeing.  Aracelys does not have any employees or collaborators; she runs and tends to her business by herself and manages her time in such a way to be a good wife and mother, in other words, a good family member.\r\n\r\nBecause the transcriptions she does are of such high quality, she has several customers that appreciate her kindness and good work.  Thus, she is very popular and everyone seeks her out when they need projects done.\r\n\r\nAracelys is a young woman with lots of capacity for self-improvement and an enormous willingness to work which make her most worthy of admiration.  \r\nShe is very happy working at what she knows best because she studied to be an executive secretary which makes it easier for her to manage her business and she also stays current through seminars and courses she takes constantly.\r\n\r\nThe loans that Aracelys has gotten from the Fundaci\u00f3n have been useful for her to purchase the washing machines and her profits have provided the entire infrastructure she how possesses.\r\n\r\nShe will use her latest Kiva loan to buy a computer, furniture and supplies to set up her business.  In addition, she will pay a month\u2019s rent in advance for the locale she plans to install her business in.  This change represents quite a challenge for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":569294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy a computer, furniture and supplies to stock the business.

As it was very hard to live on a low wage and to bring the children up by herself, Ainash decided to begin her own business in cattle breeding. In 2000, using her initial capital of 10,000 soms (KGS), she bought cattle for fattening and reselling. Because of an absence of appropriate conditions for livestock maintenance, Ainash decided to keep them in the neighboring village, at the farm of her mother-in-law. Such assistance from her late husband\u2019s family serves as an example of the deeply rooted, warm relations between them and Ainash. \r\n\r\nIn 2008,  Ainash applied for a loan of 100,000 KGS, which she used to buy more cattle. The revenues from this loan were used to pay for an education for Ainash\u2019s son, who was eager to be a serviceman and successfully entered the military academy. \r\n\r\nNow Ainash intends to use this loan of 100,000 KGS to broaden her business by purchasing 18 sheep and five bull-calves.

They were able to stock their business using the first few loans they received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization that has helped them make adjustments to their store, increase their sales, and provide an education for their children.  Amira\u2019s retail business is situated in a good location, but this is not the only activity in which she is involved.  She also prepares turnovers, \u201carepas\u201d (flat cornbread stuffed with various fillings), and fried foods that many families consume for breakfast.  In addition, she offers telecommunication services from her store provided through SAI, which was the original product she provided through her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nAmira says she started her business because she did not want to perform household chores all day and then sit around with her arms crossed while waiting for her husband to bring home a paycheck.  She is a hard worker who wakes up at 4am to prepare the cornmeal.  By 6am, Amira and her mother begin selling fried foods.  Later in the day, she organizes the merchandise that her husband and an employee have to deliver to their customers.  They have two pushcarts that they use to transport goods through the streets of Soledad.  Amira has more than 500 customers, so she has to prepare the same number of invoice cards that state the customer\u2019s name, the amount that has to be collected each week, and the list of products that have been delivered over the long term.  Her dream is to have several retail outlets and a large warehouse.  She currently wants to prepare for the year-end season when she sells more merchandise such as toys, small appliances, and clothing.  For this reason, she plans to use her Kiva loan to stock these items.  Her greatest challenge is the high level of competition in the area, so she wants to sell what her customers need.

Culipapa, Hinobaan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  fishing and fish-selling businesses. Her husband Elmer F., who is 40 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 8 and 17 years old. \r\n\r\nAntonieta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Antonieta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to buy materials for the fishing boat so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Antonieta F. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Carmen is married to Francisco, and together they are raising a big family of eight children. Just like Carmen, Francisco is also a vendor. They currently live in Tanza, Cavite.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a vegetable vendor offering fresh food options for her fellow community members who have the time to cook their own food at home. Having been four years in business, she knows which kinds are appealing, and which vegetables rarely sell. She also applies her learning from CCT* to her business, and earns around Php12, 880 monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, she decided on a loan amount of Php8, 000. She intends to use this money to buy more fresh vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, beans, and okra.  Other items for purchase are onions, garlic, and ginger. \r\n\r\nOne challenge Carmen faces is the unstable prices of vegetables, which greatly affects her business. Also, she finds it hard to sustain her business capital. Nevertheless, she is on the lookout for solutions to these dilemmas and will see to it that her business will become sustainable. She hopes to be able to save up for emergency purposes, and to be able to further improve her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She wants to thank Kiva lenders for their financial assistance in availing the loan and hopes that lenders will continue to fund her loan requests in the future.\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":790087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase livestock feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pulay,Luna,Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2011-06-22T02:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aurenila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":143.8,"local_amount":6252,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-18T07:51:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6276.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216836979},{"amount":119.83,"local_amount":5210,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T07:47:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5230.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221787577},{"amount":95.86,"local_amount":4168,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4184.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226975163},{"amount":119.83,"local_amount":5210,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-18T07:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5230.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233167257},{"amount":95.68,"local_amount":4160,"processed_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-18T09:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4176.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239039541}],"funded_date":"2011-06-22T16:04:28Z","paid_date":"2011-11-18T09:11:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":313528,"name":"Fidelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n    La se\u00f1ora Fidelina,  es  casada  con el se\u00f1or Celerino  y vive en la localidad de llano grande municipio de coapilla Chiapas\n\n   Ella se dedica a la panader\u00eda en donde lleva dos a\u00f1os y  comenta que le va bien ya que con ello  ha estado teniendo un buen resultado y solicito el pr\u00e9stamo para invertirlo en la compra de ingredientes como son: az\u00facar, huevo, harina, aceite, entre otros, para que con ellos se apoye y elabore su actividad m\u00e1s tiempos.\n\n    Ella se inspiro en esta actividad  porque desde muy joven ella apoyaba a sub mama con la venta y a elaborarlo y cuando se caso lo pr\u00e1ctico unos  a\u00f1os pero cuando nacieron sus primero hijos  dejo de practicarlo y hace dos s  a\u00f1os comenz\u00f3 de nuevo.\n\n     Lo que mas desea en esta actividad es que con la bendici\u00f3n de dios y el pr\u00e9stamo pueda salir adelante  y trabajar hasta que las sigan apoyando con el cr\u00e9dito.\n","en":"Fidelina is married to Celerino and lives in the town Llano Grande in the municipality of Coapilla, in Chiapas. \r\n\r\nShe devotes herself to a bakery she has had for two years, and comments that it is going well since she has been making good profits.

She trades in cereals like maize. She started this business six years ago. \r\n\r\nShe has a strong customer base that she supplies with the food stuffs. She takes delivery from the farmers at Tachiman in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana, and this has helped her to do away with middlemen. Through this, Catherine has been very helpful to her family. Out of the maize she also prepares fante kenkey and sells it by the roadside. Fante kenkey is prepared from milled grains with fish and any gravy or soup. It is enjoyed by many Ghanaians. \r\n\r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy a larger supply of maize to serve her customers throughout the season, especially in the face of increasing prices due to the current food\/fuel crisis in the country. She believes she can buy more bags of maize grains with the loan.
