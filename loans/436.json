She delivers all her milk to a local company that processes dairy products and sells them in the local market. \r\n\r\nHer first loan was used to purchase a milking machine which made her work easier and more efficient. Now she hopes to get another loan to purchase another dairy cow to increase her production of raw milk. Lenny showed great responsibility in repaying her first loan and for that reason hopes the Kiva folks with trust her once again. She thanks all of those that helped and trusted her previously. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Solson Scherman, Kiva

r\u00e1pido hasta quedarse sin existencia de algunos de ellos.  Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 en mayor volumen, con ello conservar\u00eda un stock de mercanc\u00edas no perecederas,  como caf\u00e9, azucar, arroz, aceite, enlatados, refrescos y ahorrar\u00eda en precio  por la compra en volumen y tambi\u00e9n el transporte, adicionalmente teniendo productos que muy pronto terminan para no decir \u201cno hay\u201d a sus clientes. \nLuis inici\u00f3 su vida comercial hace 25 a\u00f1os  aproximadamente,  cuando proveniente de su natal zapoteca (departamento de Santander) se instal\u00f3 en la Costa caribe e inici\u00f3 como empleado de una tienda, despu\u00e9s se independiz\u00f3 en inici\u00f3 la distribuci\u00f3n de productos l\u00e1cteos en una bicicleta y agreg\u00f3 galleter\u00eda y confiter\u00eda, simult\u00e1neamente trabaj\u00f3 en tareas de la construcci\u00f3n, en una panader\u00eda hasta que recapitulando su experiencia, emprendi\u00f3 hace 7 meses su negocio de tienda con mucho \u00e9xito y por la aceptaci\u00f3n que tiene de su clientela en su nicho de mercado.

He lives with his wife and their four children who range in age from 12 to 18.  Housewives from the community and the surrounding areas come to his store to buy everyday items for their families such as snacks, food, beverages, groceries, and other items.  His customers know him and his products sell quickly to the point that he runs out of a few items.  For this reason he is requesting a Kiva loan, his first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use the funds to buy in large quantities so that he can maintain a stock of non-perishable goods such as coffee, sugar, rice, oil, canned foods, and soft drinks.  By purchasing in volume, Luis will be able to get a discount and also save on shipping costs.  In addition, by having more products in stock, he can stop saying \u201cWe\u2019ve run out\u201d to his customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nLuis started working approximately 25 years ago.  This native of Zapoteca, in the Department of Santander, moved to the Caribbean coast and started a job as a store clerk.  Afterwards, he became independent and started selling dairy products from a bicycle.  He also started selling candy and cookies while holding down other jobs working in construction and at a bakery so that he could gain experience.  Seven months ago, Luis opened his store with great success and a warm reception from the customers who make up his niche market.  Luis has the support of his family, especially from two of his children who have gained business experience while going to school.  His greatest wish is to one day leave them with a secure source of income so that they can work persistently and with discipline.  In the meantime, his current business is generating sales profitability of no less than 8.7% while his cost of sales is 84.1%.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":822819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Apal has pursued this sphere, because she always knew how important health is and wanted to help make changes in people\u2019s lives. However, after the birth of her child, she realized this job couldn\u2019t earn enough to provide for her child's living expenses. So, in cooperation with her husband, she decided to try cattle breeding. And she wasn\u2019t mistaken. Soon Apal bought her first calves for 5 000 soms, fattened and resold them at a good deal. Now she applied for a loan from Kiva to buy some more livestock for further breeding and reselling.

He would like to add more variety to the goods he offers in his store, but he is lacking the capital to make the bulk purchases.

Helen is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 14th loan taken out by Helen from PMPC.

She is married and has 6 school-aged children.  To make a living, Lalotea operates a fishing business.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling ocean-caught fish in the local community.  Lalotea has been engaged in this business for over 7 years and earns approximately 650 Samoan tala (about $246 US)  a month from these activities.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2005, Lalotea joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lalotea has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 tala from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase a fishing boat.  Lalotea is now requesting a new loan of 1000 tala which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be her third from SPBD.  Lalotea plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n<P>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<P>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":366760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She owns a business venture, selling fried foods in the local community.  Dellilah has 3 years of experience in this business.  Dellilah needs a loan of WST $2000 to buy BBQ meat, ketchup, plastic plates & utensils, and coal.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Dellilah joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Dellilah's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Dellilah M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She has received senior high education.  Elizabeth prepares palm oil for sale at Abura. To prepare her locally made palm oil, she gets her palm nuts from the farmers at their farms.\n\nShe washes them then boils them for a while until they become tender. She scoops the cooked fruit into a big mortar and pounds gently with a pestle so as not to damage the nut. She then adds water to the pounded fruit. The pounded fruit is squeezed and filtered to get the juice out and remove the chaff. (The chaff can be used to light charcoal fires).The juice boils again and the fresh oil floats to the surface of the pot. It is scooped into yet another pot to cool.

She lives with her life partner, 38 year old Walter, and their two beautiful children.  This family lives together in their own house.  Her two children are the motivation for her to do her best at work everyday.  \r\n\r\nShe has been growing coffee and bananas for five years.  Also, she is a businesswoman selling fruit from the Peruvian jungle.  She gets them from her neighbors who produce these fruits.  She buys them, boxes them, and takes them to the Huancayo and Lima markets to sell.\r\n\r\nHer life partner offers public transportation services.  On his days off he helps Herlinda with the farming and in the business.  She enjoys the tranquility of the fields.  Nevertheless, it is difficult for her to take her products to the markets.  That is why she stocks her store with the harvest.\r\n\r\nEven though this job does not discourage her, it is seemingly self-sacrificing.  At the same time it is profitable.  Thanks to the profits she is able to give an adequate quality of life to her family.  That is why she plans to continue planting coffee, and most of all, she will increase her products and stock her establishment with them.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  She pledges to continue working in an active manner in her communal bank.  She will use the requested loan to buy more fruit in order to continue selling it wholesale.  She will also buy tires for her husband\u2019s car.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She lives in Prk. Yanog, Brgy. Tampalon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP10,000. \r\n\r\nRaquel is borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her fourth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP8,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Raquel aspires to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is 60 years old, married and has 3 adult-aged children. Claverina owns and operates a business raising livestock, primarily pigs, for fattening and sale. Claverina has been engaged in her business for over 14 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Claverina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Claverina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to purchase breeding livestock. Claverina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will again be used to purchase breeding livestock. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Claverina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":710062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase breeding livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sta.

She lives in the village of Velikaya Znamenka and sells men's and women's clothes at the local market. Viktoriya has two large, wide stalls, which allow her to expand her collection. The stalls are located in a very convenient spot in the market. As Znamenka is a small town, the market there is small as well and the biggest market is for inexpensive, practical clothing- just the type Viktoria offers.\r\n\r\nViktoriya has been trading in the market for 8 years. At this time, the income from her business is around 30,000 hryvnia. Her net income does not exceed 6,000 hryvnia per month. Viktoria would like to receive a Kiva loan of 15,000 to purchase a winter shipment of goods. Before the cold weather begins, this type of product is always in high demand. Viktoria has been in business for a long time and knows there is constant development, looking for new types of goods which bring in even higher profits. She works in a wide circle of people, ordering her goods individually. Her customers are always satisfied with her service, assortment of goods, and prices. In the future, Viktoriya plans to expand the stall and her sphere of influence."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":918946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a shipment of winter clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Velikaya Znamenka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.441667 34.345556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T04:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Viktoriya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1265.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250811128},{"amount":1004.47,"local_amount":7930,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:46:06Z","rounded_local_amount":8029.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257219852},{"amount":103.87,"local_amount":820,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:50:04Z","rounded_local_amount":830.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294594534},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1265.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301428068},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1265.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308188376},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2531.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315419491}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T23:11:03Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:01:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amanda Ross","image":240668}},{"id":362381,"name":"Jesus Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Jesus Margarita es soltera, tiene 41 a\u00f1os de edad, curs\u00f3 el primer a\u00f1o de educaci\u00f3n media, se dedica a la tejedur\u00eda de cortes t\u00edpicos, inici\u00f3 este negocio como operaria y hasta el momento lleva 10 a\u00f1os de experiencia.\n\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de hilos de diferentes colores y clases, y crear mas productos, espera ver en el futuro su negocio grande y con amplio capital","en":"Jesus Margarita is 41 years old, single and completed one year of middle school.

Lucy is a friendly member of the community with 3 children. Lucy lives with her family in a house made of concrete walls, concrete floor, and iron roof.\n\nAndingo village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from Rotary borehole. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Lucy\u2019s family, and the 13 other households using the local water source, need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nLucy has volunteered to be the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Lucy volunteered to be the promoter because she wants to help the community by encouraging them to treat water, thus allowing the community to be healthy and prosperous. There are also four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Veronica, Jane, Caroline and Julius.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Lucy\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1805380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To install and maintain chlorine dispensers to provide access to safe drinking water for the community ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caroline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":944,"name":"Juan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juan is married with one child who is eight years old.

This is 39-year-old Tina C. from Tukuyu. She is married with two children, 14 and 17.  Tina has been running a local restaurant known as \u201cmama lishe\u201d since 2007. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.<P>\r\n\r\nTina works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week, and is assisted by one employee. Tina currently earns about 100 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more rice, beans, salt, sugar and maize flour in bulk. In the future, she plans to open a new business. Tina thanks you for your support!<P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.<P>\r\n\r\n Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more rice, beans, salt, sugar and maize flour in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T14:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tina G.

Elsa would like to request for a loan amounting to PHP6, 000 to have additional capital for her business. She is hoping that her business will grow by the help of the loan she is requesting to avail.\n\nElsa is already 48 years old. With her husband Elito, they are blessed with five children. Most of them ended graduating in high school and unfortunately they weren\u2019t able to pursue their studies in college due to difficulties of life.

He is married, and he lives with his wife and their two daughters in the \u201cPueblo Joven\u201d (nickname for a shanty town) Atusparias in the Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz district.  It is located five minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe has been working close to 15 years in a small shoe repair stand.  It is near the Moshoqueque market (main wholesale market in the city).  He gets up very early every day to take care of his customers\u2019 orders.  Due to the constant demand for his services, he stays there very late.\r\n\r\nHis business is the only source of income for his family.  Therefore, every day he puts forth maximum effort to get ahead in his business.  He is asking our institution for a loan for 600 PEN, which he plans to use to buy the necessary materials like thread, dyes, insoles, and soles, etc.\r\n\r\nHis biggest desire is to buy a \u201cmototaxi\u201d (a motorized vehicle used to transport cargo and passengers), which would give him an extra daily income.  This way he could give his family a greater economic stability like giving his daughters the opportunity to have some type of post high school education.\r\n\r\nTito has previously worked with us, and he has demonstrated responsibility and punctuality in his payments.  Therefore, he is considered to be an excellent client.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She and her husband started their business together with a good-sized investment.  However, destiny intervened and her husband was killed in an accident.  His family took all the sales from her.  She had to return to her mother's house where she received all the love and support to continue.  With a little money she bought a few films and is now investing a bit more in the business.  With the Afodenic loan she is buying a variety of films for adults and children, music, and video games.  She hopes to make good profits to recover her sales and establish a client base.  She has two children, a 2-year-old and an 11-year-old, who is in elementary school.  Her greatest wish is to have her own home so as not to depend on her family and have a home to leave to her children.  She is very happy for the opportunity the institution has given her thanks to which she will reach her new goals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":426321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Movie Tapes & DVDs","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy a variety of DVDs and CDs to attract customers and improve sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-14T20:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Glennys Yamira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":48.68,"local_amount":973.51,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:58:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1006.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601879},{"amount":44.66,"local_amount":893.14,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:05Z","rounded_local_amount":922.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003216},{"amount":89.4,"local_amount":1788.06,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1847.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874286},{"amount":44.45,"local_amount":889,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":918.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604184},{"amount":44.76,"local_amount":895.3,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":925.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821422},{"amount":44.76,"local_amount":895.29,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":925.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561436},{"amount":44.62,"local_amount":892.41,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:31Z","rounded_local_amount":922.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770395},{"amount":38.67,"local_amount":773.29,"processed_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":799.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204295}],"funded_date":"2009-11-15T17:47:17Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":156817,"name":"Ochirbat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ochirbat O. is 25 years old and lives with her parents in a house in the Bayanzurkh district of Ulaanbaatar, the largest city and capital of Mongolia.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Marietta has three businesses: selling vegetables, running a general store and farming. Romeo also helps in his wife's business activities. \r\n<p>\r\nMarietta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marietta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 15,000 PHP, so lifting the family's standard of living. \r\n<p>\r\nThis time, for her sixth loan cycle, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy fertilizer for her farm and buy some pigs to raise so that she can continue to save up to educate her children and lift their living conditions.

Con su experiencia de 12 a\u00f1os fue como naci\u00f3 su gran empresa,  que hoy  cuenta con dos operarias y sus l\u00edneas principales son la  femenina  y masculina; Margenis  tiene una clientela fija ubicada en su natal Pueblo Viejo  y tambi\u00e9n en Barranquilla en estas dos partes, vende sus dise\u00f1os mediante cr\u00e9dito, de acuerdo a sus posibilidades y a las de sus clientes; tiene adem\u00e1s un contrato con una importante empresa a quien le confecciona y recupera su inversi\u00f3n a los 45 d\u00edas.

Sus principales desaf\u00edos son la falta de capital cuando hay muchos pedidos pero siempre se las ingenia para recuperar su cartera y poder cumplir con lo que recupera, y es que del capital que re\u00fana y apalanque depende el cumplimiento de su sue\u00f1o.\n     \n","en":"Margenis del Carmen is a woman from Pueblo Nuevo, a town in C\u00f3rdoba department, which is where she spent most of her life.  She then moved to Barranquilla where she married and had two children who are now 8 and 12 years old.\r\n\r\nMargenis makes clothes.  She started her business when she lost her job in the free-trade zone in Barranquilla.  She started work as a general services assistant and rose to become head of quality and design, while she trained in everything related to clothes making and perfected her skills through her formal job.\r\n\r\nWith 12 years of experience, she started her business which today employs two workers.  Her main lines are women's and men's clothing.  Margenis has regular customers in her home town of Pueblo Nuevo and also in Barranquilla.  She sells her designs in these two places.  She sells on credit according to her own situation and that of her customers.  She also has a contract with an important company for which she makes clothing and recovers her investment in 45 days.\r\n\r\nWhen Margenis started her business she bought her machinery on credit and paid back bit by bit until it was completely paid for.  Although she started her business 4 years ago, she made it fully legal 2 years ago so that she could access more formal markets.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Margenis' first one with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy raw materials and supplies such as fabric, threads, sheepskin and zippers so that she can fill the orders which she has.  Her production process is: designing, cutting, preparing, assembling, filleting and quality control.  She will make women's outfits to sell and hopes to make profits of approximately 25% on that activity so that she can continue to grow and reinvest in this December period which sees sales increase for all businesses.\r\n\r\nMargenis' greatest dream is to turn her business into a well-known, haute couture workshop with many employees and her own premises.  Her main challenge is the lack of capital when there are many orders to fill.  However, she always devises some way of recovering her wallet and being able to manage with what she recovers.  Fulfilling her dream depends on the money that she manages to get hold of and leverage.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":643840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a dynamic and proactive woman, a fighter who likes to get ahead.  Very much in spite of not being a woman who studied a profession, she has learned how to develop herself in business.\r\n\r\nShe works raising pigs and planting, and she has a mini- grocery store that is a big help in her region where grocery stores are not very common.  She also is mother and father to her four children who, together with her, have gotten ahead with the little they have managed to get.  She began raising pigs when she was 16 years old.  That was her first business; later she began to grow yucca, sesame, corn, and beans, and subsequently she has been investing in her mini-grocery store.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to buy pigs to raise.  The loan will help her acquire pigs for raising, since weight and reproduction are two very important parameters for her customers.  One of her expectations is to have a farm of pigs for reproducing and make her grocery store grow to offer a variety of products of great necessity in her community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":935704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy pigs to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T02:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Candida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1181.09,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":590.54},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":590.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":599.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":599.99,"local_amount":590.54,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:47:17Z","rounded_local_amount":599.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287428506},{"amount":600.01,"local_amount":590.55,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":600.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332005860}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T13:38:32Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T10:47:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":370590,"name":"Sovanny's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Single and 29 years old, Sovanny is a farmer in a rural area of the Thmor Koul district.

She has two children and two grand-children, who all depend on her, because her children are only able to get casual jobs once in a while. Jane sells cooked foods, within the Kiambiu slums, including beans, black beans and githeri, a mixture of maize and beans boiled together.\r\n\r\nJane previously had an embroidery business which collapsed after one of her sons was involved in a road accident, where she spent all she had including business money on his medical expenses. This son eventually died, leaving Jane and her other children absolutely poor. Jane had previously borrowed some money from one of the big Micro-finance institutions in Kenya, to enable her to run this business. Due to the medical problem in the family, she was unable to continue with the loan repayments, hence could not borrow again, since she was now viewed as a risky client.  \r\n\r\nJane started off her current business in early 2006, after she borrowed a tin of beans from a businessman, who allowed her to cook and sell the beans, then later make the payments for the borrowed tin of beans.  From the same proceeds, she managed to buy her first tin of beans, which she continued to cook, hence setting up the business. Jane is now a member of the Vumilia group of Action Now Kenya, in the Kiambiu slums, where she has so far accessed two levels of loans, of Usd. 57 and Usd. 85, both of which she used to increase her stock, and which she has since repaid successfully. \r\n\r\nCurrently Jane has only one sufuria (cooking pot) of her own, while the other two she has are borrowed, and the owner has actually been asking her to return them. Jane therefore seeks to buy two sufurias of a bigger size than what she is currently using, together with two jikos (cooking stoves) big enough for the pots she will buy. The biggest benefit to Jane will be that she will be able to return the borrowed pots, and also acquire bigger pots that will enable her to make more food, as is required by her customers. She also intends to introduce the sale of boiled green maize (corn) and green grams, which her customers have been requesting her to make.\r\n\r\nAs part of goodwill, Jane reserves the bean stock she gets from the boiled beans and githeri, to give to some of the women within the Kiambiu slums, who are too poor to buy food. They use this stock to make a stew for the family meal, hence their children don\u2019t have to sleep hungry as long as Jane is there. \r\n\r\nA loan of $75 which will be given to her in kind (i.e ANK will purchase the two pots and cooking stoves for her), will assist her not only to achieve her objective of preparing more food, but will also enable her to have more stock to serve to more people in need. The repayment period for this loan will be between 4 \u2013 8 months.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":16784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 2 sufurias (cooking pots) and 2 jikos (inexpensive cooking stoves)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kiambiu Slums, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-02-24T01:25:50Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-10T01:49:13Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":75,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-04-11T07:25:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-07-06T20:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":12755},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-04-11T07:25:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-07-06T20:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":12756},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-04-11T07:25:54Z","settlement_date":"2007-07-06T20:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":12757},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-04-11T08:26:57Z","settlement_date":"2007-07-06T20:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":12760},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-07-06T09:24:50Z","settlement_date":"2007-07-06T20:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29653}],"funded_date":"2007-02-24T01:49:13Z","paid_date":"2007-07-06T09:24:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":9152,"name":"Setima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Setima used to work, but was forced to quit her job to look after her four little children.

Satemi bersama suaminya sudah tinggal di Bali selama 5 tahun. Hal itu dilakukannya karena ia ingin meningkatkan kesejahteraan keluarganya. Di Jawa penduduknya sangat padat dan sangat sulit untuk membuka usaha. Sekarang mereka tinggal disebuah rumah sederhana dengan lahan sewaan bersama 2 orang anaknya. Suaminya bekerja sebagai seorang pencari kayu bakar untuk dijual kembali. Dia sudah mempunyai langganan tetap sehingga pemasarannya tidak perlu dikhawatirkan. Untuk menunjang usaha keluarga, Satemi membuka usaha warung dirumahnya. Satemi juga mempunyai pelanggan tetap, karena disekitar lingkungan tempat tinggalnya banyak terdapat usaha pembuatan batu bata. Sehingga saat jam \u2013 jam istirahat siang, warung Satemi banyak dikunjungi pelanggan. Untuk meningkatkan pendapatan warungnya, Satemi mengharapkan untuk mendapat pinjaman sebesar Rp. 1.000.000.- Pinjaman itu akan digunakannya untuk membeli sebuah rak kaca dari bahan stainless seharga Rp. 500.000.- sehingga kelihatan lebih menarik dan hygienis, karena yang sekarang masih dari rak kayu. Sisa dari pinjaman itu akan digunakannya untuk menambah kelengkapan warungnya. Saat ini Satemi bisa memperoleh keuntungan sebesar Rp. 25.000.- per hari dan Satemi berharap dengan adanya perubahan dan penambahan kelengkapan di warungnya, ia bisa meningkatkan keuntungan yang didapatnya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":163976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy glass rack and add sales items (Membeli rak kaca dan menambah barang dagangan)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-05-26T03:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Satemi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-09T05:19:32Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-06-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":234612.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":249978},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-07-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":234612.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":278568},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-08-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":234612.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308066},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-09-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":234612.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339204},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T21:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":234612.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308466}],"funded_date":"2008-05-26T05:19:32Z","paid_date":"2008-12-16T21:07:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":54213,"name":"Rooslana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rooslana is single.

She is married with four school-aged children.  To make a living, Lona operates a family member's business raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes primarily from planting and harvesting bananas for sale.  Lona has been doing this for over six years and earns approximately 800 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2004, Lona joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lona has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Lona is now requesting a new loan of 2200 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be her sixth loan from SPBD.  Lona plans to use the additional revenue generated to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

anywhere else. He studied till 8th grade and then emigrated to neighboring south Africa to learn a living. There he learnt how to build and paint ceilings, although he has not done that any more in a long time.\r\n\r\nGilberto lives with his partner and has two children with her, aged 7 and 4. The eldest goes to school and the youngest will go soon. He also supports one sister of his who lives nearby.\r\n\r\nGilberto had been working for a while as a car painter till, in 2004, he opened a hairdresser's nearby which he now runs. He has a couple of employees and makes an income of about 500 meticals per day.\r\n\r\nGilberto is asking for a loan to start up a little grocery business within his property, at a stall next to his house that he shows in the photo and is about to finish.

single and mother of 2 children aged between 19 and 22. In her second last year of high school she lost parents and due to lack of support started a business selling smoked fish. She has a daily revenue of 30000 to 50000 and gets her supplies from the inland markets or from the riverside villages where fishing is the principal activity.  With the loan she hopes to receive, she will buy 5 baskets of Mboto (large carp). 10 baskets of brown bullheads (Ngolo) and 8 baskets of sea lamprey or eel (Nzombo), all heavily consumed fish in Congolese familiies.\r\n\r\nIn time, she has plans to expand and to open a large fish outlet, and have the riverside suppliers deliver their baskets of fish rather than her having to make the trip by canoe each week. The more she increases her stock, the greater her profits will be, enabling her to increase her savings and in turn provide for her family and put her children through tertiary level education.<br

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been farming for 10 years and is well known for her farm work.  What she most likes about her business is caring for her crops as her household income depends on it.  She considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her produce from the farm to the city of San Francisco which is where she receives the best prices for her product.  In the future, Faustina would like to increase her crops, buying more cacao and coffee plants so that she can obtain good produce.\r\n\r\nThis will be Faustina's thirteenth loan from MFP and she pledges to make her repayments on time as she has in the past.  She gets on well with the other members of her community bank and they enjoy spending time together.  With the 2,000 soles that she has requested, Faustina will buy cacao and coffee plants so that she can increase her production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":927885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cacao and coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T02:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2025.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400798}],"funded_date":"2011-11-25T22:48:14Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":366509,"name":"Moeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moeun is a 34-year-old widowed woman from Reussey Keo commune, a suburb area of Phnom Penh where she lives with her three children.

Working 7 days a week and 13 hours a day, he earns about Le 750,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.\n\n Michael has already received and successfully repaid a loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy Novalgin tabs, Amoxicillin, Dexedrine and Paracetamol. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 400,000. In the future, Michael plans to establish a desk-top publishing center, to build a house and educate his children.   He thanks you for your support.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":948007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy Paracetomal, Amoxicillin, Dexorange, and Novalgin.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kenema","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-01-23T02:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Michael  M.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124825},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505732},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974836},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815402},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:04:44Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444456},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537168},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284641},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338211},{"amount":235,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1010500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354614}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T12:35:19Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":382898,"name":"Nguyen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nguyen, 54, is married and has two daughters.

She learned this trade in the same way and now she has set up in the artisans market of her town. Eight years ago she formally started her small business by inheritance of her parents, because this is the popular tradition and the community way of living that was passed down to her. Marisela has two children, 2 and 4 years old, and this is the reason she wants to increase her business and get a better standard of living.<p>\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan for $475 USD and hopes to be able to buy crude clay products (i.e. firewood and clay). She is committed to repaying the loan in a term of 6-12 months.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nESPA\u00d1OL<p>\r\n\r\nMarisela Gonz\u00e1lez tiene 28 a\u00f1os y vive en San Bartolo Coyotepec en el estado de Oaxaca, esta comunidad es famosa por tener gente especialista en la elaboraci\u00f3n de piezas en barro negro.

But the rains have been heavy the last few months, causing some damage to the room and the wooden walls and now the renters are asking that she fixes it.

He lives with his parents in the Ni\u00e9bala quarter of the town of Bougouni (the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Not having been to school, he very quickly started trying to make money, notably working every day with traders in the square. After gaining several years' experience of this, he decided to start buying and selling food items himself. His little shop is located in the large Bougouni market. Whilst looking for extra financial resources, he decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso's loan programme. This is his first time with the programme. With this loan he is planning to buy various food items. He buys his produce from wholesalers in Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali). His customers are members of the local population. With this loan, he hopes to earn a monthly profit of 67,000 FCFA which will be used to grow his business and cover family expenses.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Lara Francis, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":472235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy various food items to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-18T16:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohamed ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-17T09:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991340},{"amount":84.37,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021615},{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746405},{"amount":84.37,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778941},{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961153},{"amount":84.37,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699328},{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913272},{"amount":84.37,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180468}],"funded_date":"2010-01-18T18:13:57Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lara Francis","image":null}},{"id":173397,"name":"Beatice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatice B. bakes bread for sale at Elmina.

She is 38 years old, single, and is the mother of 3 children. The older two are 19 and 14 years old, and the third is 9 months old. The older children go to school and live with their father. Lili studied up to 12th grade, but wasn't able to continue studying because she couldn't afford it. She lives in her own home with her youngest child, and doesn't support anyone else financially. \r\n\r\nShe moved from the city of Maputo to Matola in order to be close to her work. She has worked in the court system of Maputo for more than 3 years as an assistant. She has a set work schedule, from 7:30 AM to 3:30 PM. She also employs someone to help her with housework and to care for her youngest daughter. She receives a monthly salary of  2000.00 meticales as well as a variable work bonus that depends in part on the number of court cases being tried. She uses her earnings to cover household expenses and also saves some in her bank account. \r\n\r\nLili had taken out loans before with Banco Procredit, but later decided not to continue working with them. She heard about Hluvuku from neighbors of hers who had taken advantage of the services it provides. This is her first loan, in the amount of 10,000.00 meticales. She plans to use it to buy construction materials (iron, support beams, cement, sand and other items) to continue with her home improvement project. \r\n\r\nShe promises to repay this loan as agreed, in order to be eligible to take out others in the future. She would like to take out other loans in order to finish working on her house and then furnish it, in order to offer her family better living conditions.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

In the future she\u2019d like to have a store where she can sell larger amounts of shoes.\r\n\r\nThis is her 3rd loan with MFP.  She has no doubt that she will repay her loan installments on time because she has a lot of faith in her business.  She will use the requested 1000 new soles to buy more shoes to increase the amount she usually sells.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":774849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to stock up on more shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-24T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":152.01},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":158.52},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":163.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":169.15},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":176.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":180.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.45},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.22},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.43},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.05},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57,"local_amount":152.01,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:48Z","rounded_local_amount":156.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550354},{"amount":59.64,"local_amount":159.03,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":164.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719030},{"amount":61.03,"local_amount":162.74,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":168.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350497},{"amount":64.77,"local_amount":172.73,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":178.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850979},{"amount":66.59,"local_amount":177.56,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":183.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666141},{"amount":65.97,"local_amount":175.93,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":181.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836423}],"funded_date":"2011-05-24T02:21:24Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":305025,"name":"Salvacion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Salvacion works hard to support her family.

To make her aims come true she is asking for financial assistance in the amount of 10,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP).

You can find Cinthia at her stand in the Alameda Marina Aguilar from the afternoon until midnight.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p> With this loan of 1000 Nuevo Sol ($350), which she will repay in four months, she will purchase supplies needed for the preparation of her food such as rice, sacks of sugar, gallons of oil, and large quantities of condiments in addition to daily purchases of beef, chicken, pork and fish which allows her to prepare many different dishes from the region to satisfy the tastes of her customers.  Erika is a young woman of 33 with three children.  She wants to provide them a better future and a good education.  She has a goal of having her own store front for her business.

This is 35-year-old Tamaly A. from Kyela. She is a widow with two children, ages 5 and 11. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent orphan. Tamaly has been running a crops-selling business since 2006. She buys cocoa seeds and rice from farmers and sells them in the market at a higher price. \r\n<P>\r\nTamaly works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Tamaly currently earns about 180 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase more cocoa and rice in bulk. In the future, she plans to establish another business. Tamaly thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Ortiz district.  This is five minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nIn April of this year she and her husband bought a used car.  They use it working in the sale and distribution of clothes.  They travel to Ecuador or to Lima two or three times a month to buy their merchandise and distribute it to the main establishments in the city.  Also, her husband works as a taxi driver in the car when they are not away from Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nThe continual use and the age of the vehicle have made it start to have mechanical problems with the motor.  That is why she has seen the need to ask our institution, for the first time, for a loan for 2,000 PEN.  She plans to use it for the repair and maintenance of their car.\r\n\r\nHer biggest goal is to save enough money to buy some land and build her own house.

She also takes care of her sister's children.  She owns a store in Kisaasi selling charcoal and sells to all categories of people at retail and at wholesale.  She wants to use this loan to buy more bags of charcoal.  Margaret doesn\u2019t incur any transport costs because she buys from her place of work. She has been in this business for five years. Besides this charcoal business, she also sells second hand clothes. Her major customers are her neighbors. She works seven days a week. Margaret's biggest challenges are seasonality and debtors.

Her stationery store generates a gross profit of 25%, the beverages and soft drinks around 49%-50% and she recently added a computer and printer that she expects will generate 90% profits.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.
