Altagracia operates her own `fritura\u00b4, a small business that makes homemade snacks such as empanadas and minced meat. She is requesting a loan so that she can buy more flour, oil, pork and chicken so that she can meet the demands of her customers. After preparing the food in her house, she goes out into the community to sell. In the Dominican Republic, it is very common for people to buy a snack on the street corners as they walk to work, their homes, or simply when they are out and about. Altagracia has continued to grow since her first loan of $100.  Her loan amounts and ability to repay have increased over the years and she is now on her 7th loan in the amount of $900. She hopes that her business will continue to grow and become more stable with the help of this loan. In her free time, Altagracia enjoys spending time with her 8 grandchildren.

the way of life for many people in their village. Through her small variety store business, she hopes to make it more convenient for people to access their basic needs, especially food. Their village is very far and is inaccessible to transportation, markets and hospitals. These concerns led Teresa to think of a business that would help people in their village. Therefore, when she had access to a loan through her membership in ASHI, she put up a small variety store. From then on, her business has not only been helping her own family through her profits, but also other families through the access to goods that she has introduced.\r\n\r\nTeresa wants to develop her business further through the loan she is requesting. She hopes that the time will come when her business will become sustainable and profitable to be able to achieve her personal dreams of educating her only child at college.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":427442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She is the coordinator for her group, Caminando con Jes\u00fas (Walking with Jesus), and her story is representative of the other borrowers in the group.\r\n\r\nAna and her husband live with their four children, ages ten to nineteen. They live in a simple house near Santiago, the second largest city in the Dominican Republic with a population of over a million people. Life around the city can be difficult with little access to reliable electricity and running water. Despite any difficulties she may face, Ana runs a successful shop from her home selling clothes. She plans to use this loan, her third from Esperanza International, to purchase new blouses for women and pants for both men and women. She will then sell the clothes to her friends and neighbors at a small markup.\r\n\r\nAna is very grateful for her newfound access to financial services such as loans and savings, as well as health services for her family.

For example, she has a regular post at the fair of Alasita that she can rely on working; in this manner, going from fair to fair, she supports herself throughout the entire year.\r\n\r\nThese three people are the head of the Banco D. Empredimiento, which is maD. up of ten people who, because they all know each other, form a guarantee amongst themselves that they will not miss their payments, making the bank a reliable institution.\r\n\r\nA majority of the members rely on their own fixed place of business to earn money.  The other 10% takes merchandise to peoples' homes, delivering goods to a regular group of customers, since they do not own their own homes from which they could work.  All the members are very hard-working, and their businesses are their only source of income, which they rely upon to maintain their homes and families.  They are responsible with their loans.  Currently, they are working with their fourth loan from Kiva and have not had a single problem.  They all know each other very well and work together to assist each other.\r\n\r\nThe loan they now request is to be used for purchasing merchandise and, in a few cases, to increase capital to put towards improving work places.  \r\n\r\nAll of the members are very thankful to both Emprender and Kiva for the confidence those groups have displayed to them in offering loans to the members to improve their businesses.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":483198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"COMPRA DE MERCADERIA","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-02-04T21:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carla Delia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doris Carmi\u00f1a","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Frida Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeanneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carol  Ogalin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian Betzabe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Armanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":13948.72,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1490.99},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1694.35},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1722.03},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1750.15},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1778.74},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1807.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1837.32},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1867.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.98},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.07},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.23},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.73},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":271.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":216.45,"local_amount":1490.99,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1508.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123901693},{"amount":245.98,"local_amount":1694.35,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:48:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1714.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123901694},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1722.03,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1742.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128936100},{"amount":254.07,"local_amount":1750.15,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1770.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128936101},{"amount":258.23,"local_amount":1778.74,"processed_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1799.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136663651},{"amount":262.45,"local_amount":1807.79,"processed_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1829.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136663652},{"amount":266.73,"local_amount":1837.32,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1859.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144696460},{"amount":271.09,"local_amount":1867.35,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144696461}],"funded_date":"2010-02-09T02:50:23Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:08:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":178115,"name":"Rosa Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"A primera vista es claro que Rosa Mercedes E.

R. is a very entrepreneurial woman. She is 40 years old, lives in the Villa del Carmen de Soledad neighborhood, and has 2 daughters, ages 11 and 2. She holds several jobs to improve her life, mostly tailoring and retail sales. She has been a client of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for 3 years and this is her third loan, which will be invested in the purchase of merchandise, specifically school supplies, beauty products, fabrics and supplies for tailoring.\r\n\r\nShe taught herself how to sew and started her business 10 years ago, making bedspreads, sweatshirts, and custom clothing for her friends. As she gained experience, she earned more income that she used to buy a multifunctional printer\/copier that allowed her to offer photocopy services to her neighbors, and a display case to sell beauty products and herbal supplements. Rosa is also a connoisseur of food: she makes fried foods such as deditos (cheese roll), empanadas, and french fries in the evenings and hallacas (meat and vegetables wrapped in cornmeal and banana leaves) on the weekends. She prepares these foods with the help of her mother and her sister-in-law. She says her micro-loans have helped her develop her business because she never had access to financial resources before working with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.\r\n \r\nSince her divorce 2 years ago, Rosa has had to face many challenges alone while caring for her family. Her goal is to buy her own house for her and her daughters. She also wants to open a restaurant offering Afro-Caribbean food, which consists of a lot of fish dishes. With this end in mind, she is currently taking a culinary course at SENA de T\u00e9cnico, a technical college. The schedule, 10:00 at night until 5:00 in the morning, is difficult, but she is motivated by her dream of starting a restaurant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva

Life in rural areas of the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to healthcare, among other dangers. Despite these difficulties, Santa runs a successful business making housing crafts, embroidery, and home decorations. With this loan, she plans on purchasing a sewing machine, fabric, and other sewing supplies for her business.\r\n\r\nThis is Santa\u2019s seventh loan with Esperanza International. With her access to capital, she hopes to continue the growth of her business. Santa has used her profits from her sewing business to help pay for food and medicine that would otherwise be too expensive. Santa also has been able to use profits to pay for school supplies, including backpacks, notebooks, and shoes for her children. With her continued income, she hopes to one day purchase a computer for her family and build her own home \u2014 two very important symbols in the climb out of poverty. Santa looks forward to taking out larger loans with Esperanza, and is content in knowing that, with her work stability, her children will receive a great education so that they can become professionals in whatever they choose.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families from poverty through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope.

For this reason, they decided to give their group the same name so that it might receive the same blessing.  The group is located in the State of Puebla, Mexico.\r\n\r\nBrenda T. is the group's treasurer.  She is 27 years old, studied up to the sixth year of elementary school, and sells shoes.  She also has a stall where she sells 'gorditas' (stuffed corn cakes).  Brenda has two children (a son and a daughter).  She started making her 'gorditas' three years ago.  Her 'gorditas' are stuffed with beans that have been cooked on a special hotplate with salsa and cheese.\r\n\r\nBrenda is requesting this loan so that she can rent business premises and also pay a couple of months' rent so that she can work more hygienically as she currently works in the corner of her home.  In addition, she would like to buy tables so that she can present a better image and provide more comfort to her diners who have congratulated her on the change that she is planning to make and for having thought of them.

old, married, and has four children. In search of additional income for the family, in 1991 Mayrambubu and her husband started their business, raising and selling animals, initially investing a sum of 50,000 KGS. Today, Mayrambubu's farm has 5 cows, 1 calf, 45 sheep, and 1 mare , bringing in a monthly income of 13,500 KGS. To further develop their business, Mayrambubu has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy a mare and goats.

Their objective is to have a cart and donkey that will enable them to generate more resources.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":266379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy firewood and soap ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kanou                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sogoni          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Collette     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata     Y.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.34,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":84025.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135808},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":42012.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033609},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":42012.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620977},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":42012.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019942},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":42012.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242687}],"funded_date":"2009-03-01T15:58:44Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":91548,"name":"Laila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Laila got married at an early age.

The couple's income is not enough to sustain the basic needs of the family.\r\n\r\nMyrna heard about ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), who provide loans to the poor, from her friend. She was motivated to join and she got capital to start a business. She applied for a loan to buy assorted foods for her variety store. She hopes that, with her new venture, she can save enough money to support the needs of her seven children.

She owns a business venture, making clothing.  Luafitu has 4 years of experience in this business.  Luafitu needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase additional equipment & tools such as needles & threads.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 1000 talas or US $417 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of sewing lavalavas and puletesis, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at: http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SewingLavalavasAndPuletesi#\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Luafitu joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Luafitu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Luafitu T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She lives with her family in Lagos State, Nigeria.\r\n\r\nUzoma sells crayfish and palm oil. Crayfish is a seafood that is used in cooking and palm oil is also used for cooking. Before now she sold cooked food by way of hawking from place to place but this was really stressful to her and earned little profit.\r\n\r\nUzoma joined LAPO micro-finance and changed her line of business to this present trade.

It is located in the community of Huitzililla, in Ciudad Ayala, in the State of Morelos, Mexico.  The group's members are: Margarita, who will use her loan to buy soft drinks, cookies, bleach, etc. with which to stock her grocery store; Maribel, who will buy men's, ladies' and children's shoes to fill some orders; young Santiago, who will buy soft drinks and Juana, who will buy ingredients for making red 'mole' chili paste.\r\n\r\nJuana is 35 years old.  She has a common-law marriage and three children: 16 year-old Elizabeth who no longer attends school but helps her mom around the house; 14 year-old Luis Dami\u00e1n who is in high school, and 10 year-old Analitzi who is in elementary school.  Juana requested her loan to buy ingredients for making red 'mole' chili paste.  She will buy dried Poblano chilis, Mulato chilis, Pasilla chilis, Guajillo chilis, sesame seeds, peanuts, almonds, raisins, seeds, cumin, pepper, cloves, chocolate, oil, plantains, etc.  She started her business three years ago.  As she makes very tasty red 'mole' chili sauce, her aunt said that she should sell red 'mole' paste and loaned her the money to buy ingredients.  Juana and her daughter go out to sell their 'mole' paste to local housewives.  People also hire her for parties so that she can prepare their 'mole' sauce.  For this reason, she likes to have in stock the supplies she needs to prepare her red 'mole' paste.\r\n\r\nJuana's business is important because it has helped her family, when they have most needed it, in covering school expenses, registration fees and uniforms.  It has also helped to cover household expenses such as electricity, gas and food bills.  Juana's dreams and hopes are for her family and her business to do better and for her to be able to leave her children something and teach them how to run their own business.\r\n\r\nHuitzililla is a village where people grow sorghum, corn and onions.  They celebrate San Tomas on December 21st each year and there are masses, processions, first communions and bullfighting.  The group's members would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"thank you for the trust that you have placed in us.  Although we are people who don't earn much, we are also people who like to pay back our debts.  We hope that you continue trusting and continue helping more people who need it\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":774597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy dried Poblano chilis, Mulato chilis, Pasilla chilis, Guajillo chilis, sesame seeds, peanuts, almonds, raisins, seeds, cumin, pepper, cloves, oil, chocolate and plantains to make red mole chili paste.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-05-26T02:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santiago","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.63},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.62},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.63},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.62},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.63},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":421.88,"local_amount":4875,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4923.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512714},{"amount":281.25,"local_amount":3250,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3282.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223360},{"amount":281.25,"local_amount":3250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3282.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201637},{"amount":140.62,"local_amount":1625,"processed_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1641.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807237}],"funded_date":"2011-05-31T14:57:25Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":305462,"name":"Rakiyatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le premier cr\u00e9dit que Mme Rakiyatou  sollicite lui servira \u00e0 acheter des bijoux au BENIN (pays voisin).

and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Because he had such a large family, he needed to earn a lot of money in order to support his family and provide good living conditions for them.  He thought a lot and decided that growing agricultural crops and animal husbandry would earn him a good income, and he has now been involved in this business for over 30 years.  He primarily grows barley to feed his livestock.  Currently, he has three cows and twenty sheep.  He wants to expand his business and increase his profit, which he is planning to receive from this buisness, and wants to pay for his grandchildren, who he loves very much, to go to school.  Tolibjon wants to obtain a loan in the sum of $1000 for the purchase of livestock and livestock feed.

Her husband works as a welder.  Yulduzkhon decided to become involved in retail sales at the local market seven years ago, after investing a sum of 25,000 som (KGS) - money that she earned through hard labor in Russia, where she and her husband used to travel for work.  Times were hard for Yulduzkhon at first because she did not have enough money and had to borrow it.  Due to this, her husband continued to travel for work, thus, helping Yulduzkhon to get her business off from the ground.  Today, Yulduzkhon actively works and currently has a revolving capital of about 150,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to increase her revolving capital and expand merchandise assortment.  This will also allow Yulduzkhon to work together with her husband and avoid future travels for work.  Yulduzkhon's dream is to expand her business and build a big house for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":911182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to broaden merchandise assortment and increase revolving capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzylkiya town, Batken region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-08T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yulduzkhon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":7208},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":7318},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":7525},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":7738},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7958},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8183},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8415},{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8653},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8899},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":9151},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":9410},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":9542}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.99},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.55},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.24},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.07},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":319.57,"local_amount":14526,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":14614.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722510},{"amount":165.55,"local_amount":7525,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":7570.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125441},{"amount":170.24,"local_amount":7738,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":7785.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250594},{"amount":175.07,"local_amount":7958,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":8006.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975567},{"amount":180.03,"local_amount":8183,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":8232.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276816140},{"amount":185.13,"local_amount":8415,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":8466.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283072160},{"amount":190.37,"local_amount":8653,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8705.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370742},{"amount":195.77,"local_amount":8899,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":8953.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285410},{"amount":201.33,"local_amount":9151,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":9206.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338998},{"amount":207.02,"local_amount":9410,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":9467.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095356},{"amount":209.92,"local_amount":9542,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":9600.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329603}],"funded_date":"2011-12-22T17:41:24Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T11:43:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":358769,"name":"Loukiatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Loukiatou est une femme de 35 ans.

Its history includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and many famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets like Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing dress-making services to local community members.

Peregrina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Peregrina from GDMPC.

This is why he finds himself asking for a loan of 1800 soles to Edpyme Alternativa that will help him achieve his objectives.\r\n\r\nCesar is a responsible father who completely gives himself to his family. All of the efforts and initiatives he takes have as a goal to help them succeed. He has previously worked with our institution and has shown that he is punctual and responsible with his payments. He appears next to his wife in the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esteban Riojas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":518045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy animals to raise and sell, and their respective balanced feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Cruz del M\u00e9dano - M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-31T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":124.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":129.28},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":141.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":141.68},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":145.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":153.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":161.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":167.53},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":171.8},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":177.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.69},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.12},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.16},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.42},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.39},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.46},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.04},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.84,"local_amount":124.16,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":127.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662384},{"amount":46.98,"local_amount":130.12,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":133.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695087},{"amount":46.69,"local_amount":129.28,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":132.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878132},{"amount":51.12,"local_amount":141.56,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":145.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618159},{"amount":51.16,"local_amount":141.68,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":145.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832561},{"amount":52.42,"local_amount":145.17,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":148.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099166},{"amount":356.79,"local_amount":988.03,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1012.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554594}],"funded_date":"2010-04-01T01:24:13Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Esteban Riojas","image":812572}},{"id":194840,"name":"Sanat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sanat H. is a 50-year-old businesswoman.

Villaflor is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Villaflor joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Villaflor has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Villaflor is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the second loan taken out by Villaflor from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Maria\u2019s food stand is the busiest in the Asunci\u00f3n market in the city of Tarma.  Every day her customers come by her stand to enjoy the delicious meals that she prepares.  She is a very skilled cook and the love of cooking was instilled in her from the time she was small, and she feels very happy to be able to work in this area. What she most likes about her work is to cook and she does this carefully.  She has been working as a cook for the last 37 years but what she finds the most difficult is seeing to the people who come into her restaurant.

This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy new equipment for the motorcycle repair shop so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Myrna is a DunggA. woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project DunggA.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers count on for their income. Aside from direct selling, she sells processed meat. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 5,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan amounting to PHP 36,000 that will help her to continue her business. She will be using the loan to buy orders for her customers.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 60 years old. Medela is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Medela owns & operates a motor cab transport business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing motor cab transport to local community members. Medela is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Medela joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Medela has successfully repaid a previous loan from GDMPC. Medela is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Medela from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business and to improve her general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisher folks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

For men, the traditional way of making a living has always been either farming or cattle breeding. However, over the last decades, women have diversified their occupations and started doing various other jobs. As for the production of national articles, it requires lots of patience, love and enthusiasm since, if a woman does not put all her talent and passion into the work, she might not make a good article and her product may be left unsold. The heroines of our story make national articles and are involved in cattle breeding and farming. \r\n\r\nNabat S. is 50. She has raised six children. Her daughters are married and live separately. Her only son works in Russia and visits his parents once a year. Nabat\u2019s youngest daughter goes to college. To make a living, Nabat\u2019s husband works as a security guard and Nabat manufactures national articles. She learned this craft from her sister. She would never have dreamed that this acquired skill would become the main source of her income, were it not for the high unemployment rate in the country. Nabat hopes to obtain this loan to purchase fabric for making articles. \r\n\r\n<u>Nabat\u2019s partners:<\/u>\r\nParizat C., 45, is a widow. She is the mother of four children. Three of them are working in Russia. Parizat is engaged in cattle breeding. She has sheep and plans to build a new shed. For now, she needs a loan to purchase some sheep. \r\n\r\nGulzat K., 37, has two children. Both of them go to school. Gulzat\u2019s husband is a village shepherd. Gulzat is also occupied with cattle breeding and selling milk. She manages to make $170 a month. Gulzat has applied for this loan as she wants to buy a piece of land nearby for building a house.\r\n\r\nKandalat S., 43, is married and has four children. Kandalat\u2019s husband has gone to work in Russia and, for now, Kandalat is the sole provider for her family. She breeds cattle and thus manages to earn $105 a month. She needs this loan to purchase sheep to increase the total population of her livestock.\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept \u2013 <b>P<\/b>eople (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), <b>P<\/b>rofit (to be profitable to grow further) and the <b>P<\/b>lanet (taking care of the environment).

the market for a business that, as she says, \u201cserves the needs of the mind, body and soul.\u201d The idea for Elevate came to her one day while sitting in church. She says, \u201cI was thinking about how big companies merge to offer customers more services, and I realized that I could combine my 18 years of experience as a hairdresser and my passion for books to meet the needs of a vast array of people.\u201d So, eight months ago, Adriana opened the doors to Elevate, a first-of-its-kind salon, book store and coffee shop.\r\n<br>Elevate's salon offers its customers traditional salon services while its bookstore and coffee shop meet the intellectual needs of Adriana\u2019s customers. The salon side of the business offers hair styling, manicures, pedicures and massage services. Her bookstore and coffee shop offers customers an opportunity to read, exchange and purchase books while enjoying coffee and organic teas. Adriana says, \u201cThe business has turned into a community hub; people come in and trade books, and a lot of family members accompany their loved ones and wait in the shop while they get salon work done.\u201d\r\n<br>In the future, Adriana hopes to expand the services offered at her current location as well as open new locations in other communities in Dallas. Her expansion plan for her current location includes the addition of an organic juice bar in the coffee shop, facial services to the salon and a Tezmecal spa, which is a type of ancient Mayan therapy, in the current courtyard of her building. She also says that, eventually, she would like to expand her business to offer the same quality services in several locations across Dallas.\r\n<br>This loan helped Adriana complete the vision for her salon and book store. She used it to purchase two pedicure chairs and three manicure stations, along with all of the necessary implements to provide complete manicure and pedicure services. She will contribute the remaining funds to installing the juice bar into her coffee shop.\r\n<br>Adriana\u2019s business philosophy is extremely community oriented. In order to establish her business in the community, she has donated and offered free services to community organizations, offered free cosmetic services to women in the community for job interviews, and hosted events for young women\u2019s empowerment organizations. Of this, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s a real privilege to be a part of the community and these people\u2019s lives. As someone\u2019s hair stylist, you become a part of their lives \u2013 you are a therapist and counselor, not just a hairdresser.\u201d\r\n<br>With this loan, Adriana will continue to serve the needs of her customers' minds, bodies and souls, while expanding her services to meet the needs of communities like her own across Dallas.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":9100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":9100,"image":{"id":815089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

He lives in a rented house with his wife and child.  Looking for opportunities, Jes\u00fas was able to secure a job working at a brick factory.  His commitment and dedication enabled him to produce bricks of good quality and now he has his own brick business.  He sells what he produces, but he also acts as a middleman, which allows him to test the quality of bricks that he offers to his customers.  Little by little, Jes\u00fas has been able to capitalize and increase his earnings to the point that he can acquire firsthand several thousands of bricks to sell so that he can generate good income.  At the moment, he continues to work as an employee but has hopes of having his own brickyard.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is the ninth time he has received a loan from MFP.

The oldest of these works as a barber.  Her husband works as a product promoter and helps her with the household and educational expenses for their children.  She currently has a small cafe located in the eastern market.  In addition to selling food in the cafe, she also sells accessories for women. She has had this business for 3 years; she started it with the help of her husband, who gave her the severance pay from his job as an accountant in order to pay for her place in the market.  So, in this way she decided to start her cafe, which has been working little by little.  There are times when the sales are low, but she does not stop selling and she always has the help of her husband.  They both dream of giving their sons a better education and standard of life.  They have plans  to someday invest in the infrastructure of their business and also to buy a large cooler where they can store drinks and soft drinks, since at times the electricity goes down.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Laine has many years of experience in this business.  Laine needs a loan of WST $1750 to rent land to raise additional crops.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2007, Laine joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Laine's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Laine H. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                         1.4 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.4 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Thanks for these experiences, a person does not expect gifts from fate, but instead starts making his own happiness.  Mairamkul D. is forty-six years old.  She raised three children and fulfilled her parental obligation.  The children are already grown.  Two daughters are already married and live separately.  Mairamkul\u2019s son does not yet work.  Her husband currently works as construction worker.  Mairamkul spent the last few years working at a local national drinks and milk manufacturing company, called \u201cMaksym.\u201d  Exactly one year ago, she started thinking about a supplemental source of income.  Besides, her work schedule at \u201cMaksym\u201d allowed for it.  She obtained a loan from \u201cMol Bulak Finance\u201d and started selling vegetables at the local market.  Mairamkul needed only one thousand som in order to start her retail business.  And now she receives one and a half thousand som per month from the sales of vegetables.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

He has his own herd of cattle with which he works day after day to earn a living to support his dear wife and two children. \r\n\r\nJust as every business requires investment, Kahramon's business now needs to add some young bulls, which will be raised and sold. For this reason, he once again has turned to IMON International to obtain a loan to acquire the cattle and, in this way, serve to help improve the standard of living of his beloved family.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 39 years old. Amalia is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Amalia owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Amalia has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 5000 PHP per month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Amalia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Amalia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell in her shop. Amalia is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used as working capital and to purchase additional inventory. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Amalia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

He also travels to the countryside where their iced treats are very much appreciated and enjoyed.  They also make sales from their home.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this work, in the afternoons Angela sets up small premises where she sells afternoon meals.

in 1968 in the Achanan village in the Kapan region.  He has a secondary education and is an electromechanics professional.  Currently, he works as an operator at the Kapan oxygen fueling station.  Valerik is married and has a son and a daughter.  His son is 18 years old and is a second-year law student at the Kapan college.  Valerik's daughter is 21 years old, and she attends a master program at the Yerevan Architecture University.  Valerik's wife helps him with the business.  He has been involved in an agricultural business in the Achanan village for almost ten years and has his own plot of land, where he and his wife grow vegetables and wheat.  Besides this, he owns cattle and bees (two beehives).  Together with his wife, Valerik sells vegetables from his land at the Syunik regional markets, and his loyal wholesalers buy meat, milk, wheat and honey right from his house.  Valerik uses his profits from the agricultural business to pay for his children's education and to support his family.  Valerik needs a loan in the sum of 800,000 Armenian dram to buy hay for his livestock and to buy a new variety of wheat for sowing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":911619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to
