They have six children, but only three of them (ages 21, 14, and 10) still live with them.  The older children are already independent.  Ana and her family live in their own home in the District of San Luis de Shuaro.  Farming is their business activity. When she was a young girl, Ana\u2019s parents taught her how to work the land.  She currently has six plots of farmland that measure approximately 15 x 20 meters each.  On three of the plots she produces coffee, bananas, and just recently pineapple.  Her husband and children help with the farm work, which saves her the cost of hiring outside staff.  Ana also buys and sells coffee.  \u201cYears ago I only bought coffee to sell from my neighbors because I did not have the capital to invest in fertilizers for my crops,\u201d Ana happily explains as to the reason why she has both businesses.  She sees a promising future ahead.  For this reason, she wants to continue with planting on the three other plots of land that are fallow.  She also wants to rent more land in order to maximize production.  \u201cI have orders from everywhere, so I do not hesitate to invest\u201d, Ana exclaims.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her fifth loan with MFP.  Ana expresses her appreciation to the organization for giving her the opportunity to grow.  The name of her Communal Bank is \u201cLos Cafetaleros\u201d (The Coffee Growers).  She is pleased with her group because all of the members share the same interests.  Ana will invest approximately 1200 PEN in the purchase of compost so that she can fertilize two plots of coffee.  The rest of her loan will be used to hire workers to clear the land.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":919236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sacks of fertilizers and to hire workers.

Here, seven women have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cNueva Esperanza 2\u201d or \u201cNew Hope 2\u201d. The ladies are determined to improve themselves and their businesses and bring a higher quality of life to their families. Out of the 7 women, only 2 were able to attend school until the 3rd grade. The rest are illiterate.\n\nThe President of the group is 27 year old Reina. She married at an early age and has three children who range in age from 3-9. They each are enrolled in primary school. Reina has a tamale business and lovingly makes and sells them. Her business is quite popular and she has seen the need to secure a loan. She would like to buy rice, chile, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, salt, corn and firewood. This is a great time for the business as it is the end of the year and there are graduations and parties!\n\nBesides providing loans to the women, Friendship Bridge offers educational trainings during the monthly meetings. A Facilitator from the organization conducts these trainings in the indigenous language of the women and uses games, diagrams, pictures and role playing. \n\nKIVA investors from all parts of the world are valuable partners in this effort and the ladies are very appreciative. It would be impossible for them to walk into a bank and secure a loan.

sells clothing and bedspreads.  She has no fixed place of business, but sells door to door and in markets and offices, collecting her money each day, what's known here in Bolivia as a runner.  She is a 43-year-old widow with two children in school so she is the only earner in her household.  She makes sales on request, so if for example a customer asks for a dress, she finds it and sells it on the same day repaying the wholesale purchase and making a profit.  She has been doing business this way for ten years and has been a client of IMPRO since 2005 with a first class track record of paying back loans.  This credit will be used to buy clothing, bedding and other goods.  She can get them at a better price buying in volume and it will also let her show customers the goods in advance.  Her record with IMPRO recommends extending her credit as she has experience in this business. <p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Kiva Volunteer Alexis Hult <\/b> <p>  Victoria, vende frazadas, abarrotes edredones, ropa, repartiendo en los mercados, oficinas, efectuando la cobranza diariamente, no tiene un puesto fijo ya que es repartidora, actividad  que en Bolivia com\u00fanmente se denomina como  \u201ccorredoras\u201d.

Margaret works seven days a week. Her major monthly expenses include rent for her business and residence, plus medication costs. She has been in this business for the last ten years. Margaret has been with MCDT for five years and is servicing her tenth loan, working with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more jerrycans of local brew and gin for resale.

She is married with one boy, who is currently in senior high school. She is a hardworking woman who sells charcoal in her neighborhood. She has been in the charcoal business for the past 5 years.

She is always striving to offer new designs and meeting the ever-changing needs of her customers. She will use her loan from ACCION USA to purchase additional machines for making her items, fabric and t-shirt inventory, embroidery designs, and marketing. This is Kelly's first time obtaining a loan for her business - in the past, she had always used funds from previous sales to buy supplies, but was always just breaking even.<P>\r\n\r\nIn the future,

She lives with Edgar, her forty-four-year-old husband, and her two children Edgar and Gabriel, who are 14 and 11 years old, respectively.  They live in their own home.  She has a grocery store in her home, from which she sells basic necessities.  She had always thought of having and managing her own business.  She has been managing the store successfully for 3 years.  Because she offers a wide variety of products, she has obtained many customers.  Antolina is content with her work; she is more independent and is also able to meet the needs of her school-age children.  In the future, she wants to continue improving her business and to offer a greater variety of products, with the goal of pleasing her customers.

With that, she has been able to provide other basic needs, allowing them to enjoy life in a simple way.\r\n\r\nOver almost 12 years of being an ASHI member, Emelina has shown herself to be working hard to make her dreams come true and hoping that her businesses will continue to be more productive and improve the overall living conditions of her entire family. Knowing that she can access secured financial support through loans has also given her courage and faith that someday, her two children will have a good life and be ready to face their own lives.\r\n\r\nNow, Emelina is requesting a loan so that she can have the funds needed to buy more food products and basic household necessities. The remaining funds will be used to support her second venture, her sewing business. This will allow her to attract more customers and increase her sales. She believes this opportunity will give her the confidence to succeed. The financial opportunity of her sari-sari (variety) store and sewing business is one of the best ways to help provide for her family, and she very much wants to lift her family out of poverty. \r\n\r\nEmelina gave her best to develop her two business and hopes if possible, to have a full-fledged mini-grocery store and tailoring shop in the local area someday, so that she can provide employment to others who want to get ahead. The sacrifices that she has encountered are her weapon and inspiration to fight against poverty. \r\n\r\nHer family is grateful to ASHI and Kiva for allowing room for improvements.

Jovelita is now requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Jovelita from GDMPC.

Her husband, Mr. Hoang Van Chiem, and their oldest son work away from home as construction workers.  They only visit home once a month.  In order to raise her three kids, Mrs. M. works really hard on her 1.4-acre field of rice and peanut and breeds pigs and poultry.  During the first year joining the Fund, she borrowed $200 to buy pigs and poultry.  From this, she earned an average of $20-30 per month.  Encouraged by the initial success, she continued to borrow money to develop her business.  Unfortunately, her youngest son got in an accident.  All the savings from M.\u2019s project as well as the family income is used for the hospital and medicine bills.  Although facing a lot of difficulties, Mrs. M. still believes in a bright future.  Now her youngest son has just been able to walk again.  M. hopes that in 10 years, by the time she is 60, all of her children would be well-educated and each would have a good job.  Mr.s M. wants to borrow $500 to buy more pigs to expand her project, bringing more income to her family.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb M\u01b0\u1eddi s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ba con t\u1ea1i huy\u1ec7n Nghi L\u1ed9c, t\u1ec9nh Ngh\u1ec7 An.

The women are currently benefiting from a loan of around 718,000 guaranis each (roughly $200 USD). <p>\r\n\r\nThe group began with its first meetings in the home of Mrs. Marta M. who is currently the group's secretary. One of the characteristics of this group is that they are interested in constantly learning and always ask their assessor Freddy Bordon to school them in specific areas such as marketing, public relations, finances, break even points amongst other topics. <p>\r\n\r\nThe committee has embarked on a project for the month of June 2008 to host a celebration for Saint John in the neighborhood square. The proceeds will go to helping their neighbor who is currently ill but was once a member of the committee. <p>\r\n\r\nLaura, the group leader, expresses the thanks of all the members of the \"Yboty\" committee to the Paraguayan Foundation for being the only institution that has given them the chance to receive a formal loan to use as working capital and for enabling them to manage their own business. <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nToday they are requesting a new loan to invest in their mirco-enterprises by purchasing products to be sold in their kiosks such as sugar, meats, rice, vegetables, fruit, candy, soda and others. Those who prepare and sell food, especially \"chipa\" (a traditional Paraguayan bread with cheese) need to purchase ingredients.

This place is known in the area for the great agricultural production that it has. Many merchants come to Concepci\u00f3n to buy vegetables, for the most part, biweekly. The peasants plant onions, carrots, and cabbage among other vegetables. Because of the work that they put in to the land, the peasants have designed strategies to maintain the fertility of the soil. For example, in Concepci\u00f3n, the practice of rotating the type of vegetable to be planted in the same space of land for much of the year is widely used. Basic techniques like those mentioned minimize the risk of farming for the group members. \r\n<p> The Chuiquisis group has been together for almost four years. They have already had four loans with this institution. This group is very good with re-payments, since the members are very responsible. If this is not the case, at the end of the loan, the group separates from the person that has not been responsible. In this way, the reputation of the group has remained intact. The women say that the success of the group lies in the responsibility of each woman and in the fact that they choose well at the time of making the group.\r\n<p> All of the women in this group work in the agricultural sector. In their plots, the women plant the traditional vegetables of the area. They use their loan to buy seeds, fertilizer, and to rent the land. \r\n<p>Another positive aspect that this female group has is that all the women believe in the power of education. The members try to send all of their children to school, at least to primary school. This attitude is very positive, since it demonstrates a great improvement between the generations of the parents and the children.\r\n<p> The Chuiquisis Group is made up of a group of working women that want to go forward with their families. As a result, we have to extend them a hand by means of a loan that will help them to drive their businesses and to generate more profits that will allow them to invest in their children. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by A. Shah, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres Chuiquisis provienen de un pueblo muy rural en el departamento de Solol\u00e1 llamado Concepci\u00f3n.  Este lugar es conocido en el medio por la gran producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola que tiene. A Concepci\u00f3n llegan muchos comerciantes a comprar verduras al por mayor quincenalmente. Los campesinos siembran cebollas, zanahorias, repollo entre otras verduras. Los campesinos debido a la presi\u00f3n que ejercen a la tierra han dise\u00f1ado estrategias para mantener la fertilidad de la tierra. Por ejemplo, en Concepci\u00f3n es ampliamente practicada la t\u00e9cnica de rotaci\u00f3n de cultivo as\u00ed como var\u00edar el tipo de vegetales que van a sembrar en un mismo espacio de tierra a lo largo del a\u00f1o. T\u00e9cnica b\u00e1sicas como las mencionadas minimizan el riesgo del cultivo para las clientes.\r\n\r\n<P>El grupo Chuiquisis lleva junto por casi cuatro a\u00f1os. Ellas ya han trabajado cuatro cr\u00e9ditos con la instituci\u00f3n. Este grupo ha sido de muy buena paga ya que las integrantes son muy responsables, y cuando no lo son, al final del cr\u00e9dito separan a la persona que ha faltado con la instituci\u00f3n. De esta manera la reputaci\u00f3n del grupo se mantiene intacta. Las se\u00f1oras comentaron que el \u00e9xito del grupo yace en la responsabilidad de cada mujer y que se escogieron muy bien a la hora de formar el grupo.\r\n\r\n<P>Todas las se\u00f1oras de este grupo trabajan en el sector agr\u00edcola. En sus terrenos ellas siembran los vegetales tradicionales del \u00e1rea. Ellas utilizan su cr\u00e9dito para la compra de semillas, abono, fertillizante y algunas lo utilizan para el alquiler de la tierra. \r\n\r\n<P>Otro factor muy positivo que tienen este grupo de se\u00f1oras es que todas ellas creen en el poder de la educaci\u00f3n. Las clientes tratan de env\u00edar a todos sus hijos a la escuela, por lo menos a la escuela primaria. Esta actitud es muy positivo ya que demuestra una gran mejora generacional entre padre e hijos. \r\n\r\n<P>El grupo Chuiquisis est\u00e1 conformado por un grupo de mujeres trabajadoras que quieren salir adelante junto con sus familias, es por eso que nosotros tenemos que extenderles una mano por medio de un pr\u00e9stamo que las va a ayudar a impulsar sus negocios y generar mayores ganancias que las puedan invertir en sus hijos."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":185962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Anteriormente ten\u00eda la idea de estudiar corte y confecci\u00f3n; pero con el trabajo en este restaurante, ha cambiado su modo de pensar;  ahora quiere tener su propio restaurante, porque ha aprendido el manejo de ello, sobre todo porque le fascina el mundo de la gastronom\u00eda  y estar en contacto con la gente, esto le va a permitir emplear a su madre, que tambi\u00e9n conoce de ese negocio. Lo malo es que no cuenta con los recursos para iniciar este negocio, debido a que conoce el funcionamiento considera que en el futuro le ir\u00eda muy bien.

She lives at home with her mother.  In her spare time she helps around the house and also with her mother's food business.  For the past 11 months, she has worked in a restaurant near the neighborhood where they live.  She works from 6:00 in the morning until 2:00 in the afternoon and then helps her mother.  Before, she had the idea to study dressmaking but because of her work at the restaurant, she has changed her way of thinking.  Now she wants to have her own restaurant because she has learned how to manage one, but mainly because she is fascinated by the world of gastronomy and being in contact with people.  This is going to allow her to employ her mother who also knows that business.  The bad thing is that she doesn't have the resources to start the business.  Since she knows how it functions, she thinks that things will go will for herself in the future.  The motive behind her determination is to support her mother and above all, she has the ambition to grow and to be a businesswoman.  \r\n\r\nNoelia now has the opportunity to receive a loan.  Right away she is going to use the money to sell chicken and grilled foods.  That way she will make her money grow and, after food sales from home with the help of her mother, little by little she will get to the point of having her own restaurant.\r\n\r\n<br

Never married, he lives by himself in his own house. For the past two and a half years he has rented out his garage to house the cars of food vendors. He decided to venture out into this business due to the fact that his retirement pay was not enough to cover his expenses. For this reason he launched a business that he could run from his home. Currently the garage accommodates 14 cars at the rate of 2 soles a day, used as extra income to help his finances. On the other hand, Demetrio\u2019s work also serves as a way for him to stay active and not feel alone.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, selling local Samoan snacks such as palusami (coconut cream wrapped in taro leaves), cooked taro, yams, and soupo ese (hearty papaya soup).  Sielaa has 4 years of experience in this business.  Sielaa needs a loan of WST $1700 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 tala or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nSielaa joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sielaa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sielaa P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.

Istatkhon is 29 years old. She has a son with her husband. Istatkhon has been running her own business for more than four years. She has a small saloon where she sells and rents traditional and national wedding dresses. Traditionally families in Tajikistan are large and consequently there are many marriages so Istatkhon has a lot of clients. The stability of her business allows her to make a considerable contribution to the family income. This is  Istatkhon's second loan with IMON International and during the previous loan cycle she was accurate and precise in the loan payments. Istatkhon is requesting $ 1300 USD in order to purchase more wedding dresses. \r\n<br>\r\nTajikistan and IMON International:\r\n<br>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. Tajikistan is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<br>\r\nIMON's History:\r\n<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has two children aged 18 and 21 years old.  She has been in business since a young age when she arrived in Barranquilla with the dream of completing Higher education studies, but as she was unable to pay for them she decided to work in a clothing department store where she gained her experience.  Once her first child was born she left her job and, using her social security benefits, she fulfilled her dream of being a businesswoman. She strengthened her business with financing from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organisation which allowed her to extend her physical infrastructure and increase her stock levels, and so increase her client base. She tells us that when she started her business in 1992, she had no capital to supply as she had invested it in buying the shop and two glass cabinets, so she went to her sister-in-law who worked as a machine operator in a clothing factory. Mabel bought materials and supplies and worked according to the designs suggested by her sister-in-law. In 1996 she joined the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo group, an organisation which has lent her a hand ever since. She started out with $300,000 COP and today she is applying for a loan of $1,400,000 COP, via Kiva, which is the eighth loan that she will have had from this organisation. With the loan she will purchase a laptop computer to record her finances and manage the administration of her small business, which is already well structured and with this piece of equipment she will improve the way that she manages her time. Mabel Rodr\u00edguez feels that she is a very successful woman and has achieved this with the support of her family, and due to her capacity for resistance when faced with adversities while working in good faith. This has allowed her to improve the quality of her family's life and strengthen her free, independent and self-sufficient spirit.  Her dream is to have an office to build her stock rotation and increase her profits.  Mabel says that her business has taught her to manage her profits so that new trends in fashion do not put her out of business, because her classic styles appeal to a special type of women and girls attending special parties such as first grade communions and very formal events.

comes from the village of Speti, Imereti Region, West Georgia. He is 56 years old and married. His family consists of four persons: Gocha, his wife Deniza, 25-year-old daughter and 22-year-old son. Gocha works as a joiner. He produces different wooden products (furniture, household goods) in his workshop and sells them locally. Deniza works as teacher in a local school. \r\n\r\nAlong with his main job, Gocha also finds time for the family's farming business. They have three milk cows and two pigs. Deniza produces cheese and sells it at the local market. The piglets are also sold locally. \r\n\r\nThe total average monthly income of the family is 600 Laris. \r\n\r\nGocha requests a loan to purchase a new, modern joiner's bench for wood processing. The new plan will allow him to diversify his production and offer new products to the customers. At the same time, the quality of his work will increase and he\u2019ll be able to sell more products, as well as slightly raise the prices. The income of the family will increase and they\u2019ll be able to improve their living

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They are from a small community but one that has a lot of culture and many customs. The area is noted for it serenity where the inhabitants are farm labourers, workers or traders.\r\n\r\nThey named the group \"Rieles\" because they live near some railway tracks and have always lived there. They know that the train used go by there a long time ago according to their ancestors. However, the tracks fell apart and now are in poor condition. Ofcourse no train runs there now but the tracks remain.\r\n\r\nDon Felipe ,the group representative says \"Ever since I can remember the tracks have been there. So when they asked us what we wanted to name the group we decided to call it \"Rieles\" (tracks)\". He is 47 years old and has been married to Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Carmen for the last 26 years. None of their children are dependents now as they are all married and live on their own. \r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan to buy 6 suckling piglets. At home he has 4 female piglets and a stud. He has been breeding livestock for 15 years.\r\n\r\nHe says that at the moment he has no problem not even his pigs becoming sick. He says this is because he prefers to buy suckling pigs rather than from a farm as the ones from the farm are very sensitive to the cold and are not used to the countryside. The suckling pigs are the complete opposite never getting sick even if left in the cold and they are fine even if taken out to graze in the fields.\r\n\r\nAlthough he has well-constructed corrals at home, he has 6 he means to fill with suckling pigs as he just sold some and has almost no pigs left.\r\nDon Felipe gives his thanks to FRAC, \"Thank you for the loan because it helps me keep my piglets healthy and strong.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":871694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 6 suckling pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-10-03T14:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3110.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784818},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3110.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270043976}],"funded_date":"2011-10-04T20:38:53Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:42:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":342102,"name":"Khurshed","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0425\u0443\u0440\u0448\u0435\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0431. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442, 29 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0418\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u043d \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0425\u0443\u0440\u0448\u0435\u0434 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0443 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u043e\u0431 \u2013 \u0414\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0431\u0435. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044b.\n\n","en":"Khurshed lives in the town of Kulob.

 Mu\u1ed9n is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by SEDA.

The official name of this borrowing group is V\u1ecdng Nguy\u1ec7t 1.\r\n\r\nMu\u1ed9n is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To making a living, Mu\u1ed9n owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale.  Mu\u1ed9n has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nMu\u1ed9n joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mu\u1ed9n is requesting for the first time a loan from SEDA.   She is a loan of 5,152,000 VND, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.   Mu\u1ed9n plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  Th\u1ee9c  is a 31-year-old female who is requesting a 7,840,000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising chickens.\r\n\r\n2.

is Amelia, 62, a resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines. Her husband is Emmanuel, who is retired.  She and her husband manage their household while operating her business. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                 \r\n            \r\nAmelia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling at retail. She also sells honey bee products for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 17,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAmelia hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":928272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-11-25T16:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":708.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":6374.97,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6487.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738801},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2833.03,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146033},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2834,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2884.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275139},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3541,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3603.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997761},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1417,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1442.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606345}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T00:53:35Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deborah Kerman","image":193796}},{"id":366701,"name":"Mar\u00eda De Los Santos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa Sra.

In 1996, in a search for income for his family, Djanybek decided to start his own business in farming and field work.

He is married to a trader, and has 4 children aged 12, 9, 6 years and a 10 months old baby, two are school-going children. He has one additional dependent, who lives with him because he helps in the business. In 2005, Osman established his electronics business.  He began his business because of the rebel war that broke in his country of Sierra Leone. Osman says, \"I was in form three (school grade 9 in the U.S) when the rebels attacked us in our village called Sanda twenty miles off from Makeni. Then we fled to Makeni and started working for people for our survival. During that time, I started raising funds until I got a substantial amount to start my business.\" Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,796,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000 . Osman has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan and now needs a new loan in order to buy tape (6 batteries) - 8 pieces @ Lr125,000, radio - 10 pieces @ Le45,000, radio with memory card - 5 pieces @ Le75,000, tape (4 batteries) - 8 pieces @ Le65,000 and electronic lanterns - 1 carton @ Le1,000,000.  The balance will be used for transport. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 269,000. In the future, Osman plans to open a shop. He felt good about taking out this loan as it helps him to boost his business.  He wants his children to have a good education. The loan will help greatly because he will be able to make a profit out of it.  Increases in the cost of goods affects him greatly because as costs change, he has to change his selling prices which affects his customers' buying pattern.  He offers quality products.  Osman serves at least 20 people per day around the city.  His business is popular because he treats his customers fairly and with respect.  He is assisted by family members. He buys his goods in Conakry twice per month and in Freetown once every week.  He saves some of his profit, some he uses to add to his working capital. He plans to expand if he is given subsequent loans that will enable him to accomplish his dreams.  He thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":987446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy electronics for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-01-21T04:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Osman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.77},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.77},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":102.78,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":449652.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505737},{"amount":102.78,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":449652.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974842},{"amount":102.77,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":449652.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815407},{"amount":102.78,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:05:31Z","rounded_local_amount":449652.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444461},{"amount":102.78,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":449652.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537174},{"amount":102.78,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":449652.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284644},{"amount":102.77,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":449652.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338212},{"amount":205.56,"local_amount":888888.92,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":899305.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354615}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T19:35:04Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Lazarova","image":1669010}},{"id":416058,"name":"Denis Elena","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Denis se encuentra casada y junto con su esposo viven en un apartamento ubicado en la cancha deportiva de su municipio; ellos son los encargados del aseo del lugar, por lo que no tienen que pagar alg\u00fan arriendo por esto.

Adem\u00e1s, Denis sue\u00f1a con alg\u00fan d\u00eda poder tener una gran tienda general ubicada en un lugar m\u00e1s estrat\u00e9gico y comercial y as\u00ed poder tener mayores ingresos para su futuro. \n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1073096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Compra de dulces, snack, y gaseosas para surtir su negocio y un refrigerador donde pueda almacenar las gaseosas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Carmen de Viboral","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Denis Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43461},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44681},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45934},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47223},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":48548},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":49911},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":51311},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52751},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54231},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55753},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57318},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58926},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60580},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62280},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":64027},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65824},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67671},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69570}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.69},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.91},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.18},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.96},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":432451,"name":"Benkadi Kagoua 2 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les  membres du groupe  Benkadi Kagoua 2 sont des femmes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 40 ans, 4 enfants et vivant toutes dans des  familles traditionnelles \u00e0 Kouroubadougou, un des villages de San, 4\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s agricoles pendant l\u2019hivernage. \nElles sont \u00e0 leur troisi\u00e8me pr\u00eat avec l\u2019institution, les pr\u00eats pass\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bien rembours\u00e9s.\nLa sp\u00e9culation cultiv\u00e9e est  l\u2019arachide  avec    KADIATOU,  assise avec une \u00e9charpe jaune, sur la photo.\nAvec son pr\u00eat, elle compte  acheter des intrants, semence, des petits mat\u00e9riels agricoles et payer les frais de labour  pour l\u2019exploitation de 0,5 hectare. \nLa production sera vendue au niveau du village et au march\u00e9 de San, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9colte, \u00e0 une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e d\u2019hommes et de femmes. \nElle compte r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice moyen de 55.000 FCFA par campagne.\nCe b\u00e9n\u00e9fice lui permettra de payer son pr\u00eat et aussi d\u2019aider son mari dans les d\u00e9penses quotidiennes.  \nNB\/ DJELIKA absente\n","en":"The members of the Benkadi Kagoua 2 group are married women with an average age of 40, with 4 children and all living in traditional families in Kouroubadougou, one of the villages in San, the fourth largest administrative region of Mali.
