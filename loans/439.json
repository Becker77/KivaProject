Farrukhdjon has a small business capitalizing on the huge demand in Tajikistan for cell phones and related accessories. He started selling phones a year ago and now has a small stand in a market. He is not married yet but despite his young age he supports his parents. Farrukhdjon\u2019s business is very personal. Often he will get a request for a specific phone or accessory and he will make a special effort to find it if he does not have it in stock. At the same time Farrukhdjon provides the service of repairing cell phones. Farrukhdjon has requested a loan to give him extra capital to purchase an instrument that is required for the diagnostics of cell phones. IMON International is happy to be able to provide the means for Farrukhdjon to strengthen his business and continue working toward his goals.  \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Two of her married daughters help her out economically.  Her plans for her family is to improve her planting conditions so that she can increase her earnings to buy a plot of land to leave to her daughters.  Petronila has been a farmer for the past 25 years.  She learned her farming skills from her parents who, as life-long farmers, taught her to work the land.  The greatest difficulty she has faced lately is the smoke from the volcano which has burned much of her crop causing her yields to be so poor that she hasn't even recouped her investment.  She is happy for Afodenic's help in purchasing fertilizers which will insure a better crop yield and products that she can sell for a better price.  She hopes to recover enough this year to meet her personal expenses and repay her loan in a timely fashion.

She is married to Rico G., a driver, and they are blessed with four children. She helps her husband earn money so that their family can have a better life. She has been making and selling rags and doormats for her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAida has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT)* for more than two years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow seven times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses all the money she borrows to buy raw materials needed to make rags and doormats. Her business earns 3,600 Philippine pesos per month. \r\n<p>\r\nNow with your help, she is applying for a 17,000 PHP loan. This money will be mostly used as added capital to expand her business by buying strips of recycled clothes to be used for her rag-making business. She dreams that her business will continue to improve so that her livelihood will improve as well. She also prays that someday all her children will have a bright future. \r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance

She earns her living by operating a transportation (tricycle) business. Her husband Vicente, who is 63 years old, drives the tricycle to help his wife in earning a living for their family. They have three children who are 15 to 24 years old. Marina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13000 helped her earn a monthly income of PHP 12000, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her eighth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use to pay the annual registration of their existing tricycle and buy a new tricycle so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and house repairs. Marina C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a general store, a pig fattening business and an e-loading business. Her husband Rey, who is 33 years old, works as a security guard to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. Fe joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Fe has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her third loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy more stock for resale so that she can continue to save up for future business improvement and home repairs. Fe is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Little by little, while her husband slept and her children studied, Lugarda sold shoes and built a customer base.\r\n<p>\r\nLugarda's husband has managed to recover and is no longer in the hospital, but the struggle to get ahead goes on.  For that reason, Lugarda is asking for a loan of US$475, to be repaid in 6 months, so that she can buy more merchandise and give her customers a wider choice of shoes to choose from.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

This bank is made up of a group of members who have their dreams and the strength to get ahead, showing their children the value of work and the way of improving themselves every day. This bank is in the Cumbe parish, a place that is privileged with its livestock and farming produce.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda lives in the 3 de Noviembre suburb in the Cumbe parish. She is a happy and charismatic member of the bank and she gets on well all her fellow members. She is 41 and married. In her married union she has had 5 children who are 23, 21, 19, 15, and 12. Her first child works in a factory called Indurama and he does not financially help in the living expenses. Her second child works in a hardware store and her salary is for her personal expenses. Her third child helps in the home because he still has not found work and her other two are still students. Her husband works as a truck driver and it is their greatest pride to be able to have their own home.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has raised animals since she was very young. She has cows, chickens and guinea pigs. Her cows' milk is taken by the milk trucks and she sells her chickens and guinea pigs to her neighbours in the community or when she has some financial need.\r\n\r\nShe has been making use of the foundation's loans for 11 years and became a member because she heard an announcement over a loadspeaker in her community. She has used the loans for the education of her children and now with the new loan she is going to buy chickens, guinea pigs and their feed such as grass, nutritional feed and maize.\r\n\r\nHer aim is to build a shed to raise more hens to expand her farm.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva

She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying rice, flour and other foods. She will use the profits to invest in her business. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she needed capital for her business. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and sugar cane industries. The main economic activities are free trading zone and a cement factory. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas in the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3725,"image":{"id":651284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is doing all she can to achieve just that. One effort to reach this goal is to have a means of sustainability. Thus, Lourdes joined CCT* as a community partner, and, with the entrepreneurial learning she gains there, she is able to run her own small business. Lourdes is married to Rolando, who is a water tender. They have a child who is now in high school.\r\n\r\nLourdes directly sells beauty products, such as local brands M.S.E., Natasha, and Board Walk,  and other accessories to friends, neighbors, and business connections. She also sells silver jewelry chosen for her clients' tastes. Rolando, on the other hand, makes money by delivering gallons of water to the homes of fellow community members with the use of his side car. Their monthly family income reaches around Php10,000.\r\n\r\nTo help grow her business, Lourdes decided to ask for a Php14,000 loan. She intends to use this loan money to purchase her own stock of products, accessories, and jewelry items for sale. She needs enough money on hand to buy her customers' orders even before their initial payments. The loan money, Lourdes says, increases her capacity to earn and helps to augment the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nOne major problem she faces is the fact that some customers do not pay on time. Lourdes takes the responsibility of paying for the sold item. But Lourdes is willing and ready to face whatever challenge lies ahead, just for their lives to be sustained and be in order. She commits herself to financing the studies of her child until she sees this child graduate from college.

In spite of their age, Juana tells us that they are very responsible and help her in caring for her crops.  Juana has been in this business for 16 years and, as she is a good farmer, she spends most of her day amongst her potato and vegetable crops.  She tells us that every harvest time they provide her with good profits as she travels to the central market in the capital where she sells them wholesale.  However, during periods of lower production, the retailers in her town buy her crops at a lower price.  This bothers her a lot.  However, she does not lose heart.  On the contrary, it gives her the strength to get ahead.  On Wednesdays and Sundays she sells meat from sheep in the wholesale market in town.  This makes her additional money.\r\n\r\nJuana belongs to the 'Miraflores de Casacoto' community bank and this is her fourth loan from MFP.

For the past six years she has made a living baking artisan bread. Her mother taught her this trade. She was a widow and had to raise Ver\u00f3nica and her three siblings on her own, so she taught her children how to fend for themselves and get ahead in life. They made tamales and pupusas before her father died. To buy the materials she needs to make her products, such as corn, flour, cheese and other items, Ver\u00f3nica has to travel to the city once a week, boarding a bus that takes five hours round trip from her house. She is requesting the loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to purchase the ingredients she needs to fulfill the orders she has in her community. Her demand is really high since her handmade products, such as quesadillas, tortas and cupcakes, are uncommon. She bakes the bread and goes out to sell it door to door through the community three times a week. With the loan, she hopes to earn more profits and in this way she can help her husband with household expenses like food, health and education, and pay for medicine for her son, who is sick and has costly treatments, and right now their income isn't enough to cover it. Ver\u00f3nica wants to save what she makes from increasing her production to help her husband buy a lot and build a home, since they live in the house of one of her spouse's relatives.

In search of income sources for his family, he started his own animal husbandry and farming business in 2002.  He grows potatoes, corn and wheat on three hectares of arable land, and also has three heads of cattle and five sheep.  Thanks to Sarybay's tenacity and persistence, his business yields from 5,000 to 25,000 som (KGS) per season today.  He also provides a taxi service during the off-season.  In order to further expand his business, Sarybay requested a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase wheat and potato seeds, treat land and purchase mineral fertilizers.  He plans to invest the profit from this loan into building a more comfortable and spacious barn and building a fence.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":946710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds and fertilizers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyrgyz-Ata village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T23:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarybay","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50103.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070926}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T02:04:02Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":375316,"name":"Rosalita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalita is a married woman and has two children.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Baptist Model Secondary School was established by the Baptist mission primarily to educate the children of Allen town and its environs. The school is staffed with fifty teachers and has 2,100 pupils.\r\n\r\nThese hard-working and dedicated teachers have come to SMT to seek a loan of SLL 7,400,000. With the help of this loan, these teachers can embark on some meaningful project that their mere salaries alone cannot do. Some of them will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to buy house building materials, buy a piece of land or pay school fees for their children, while some of them will invest the loan in a business. \r\n\r\nJohn A. B. is the leader of this group of teachers. He is age thirty-eight. Abu is married and has two children. Mr. B. will use part of his share of the loan to pay school fees for his children and will use the remainder of the loan to pay school fees for himself to pursue further studies. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":584856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":" pay school fees for his children and  for himself ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Waterloo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2010-08-20T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John A.

She lives in Purok Palasan, Brgy. Pilar, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.\r\n\r\nBy working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Rosene is now borrowing PHP 12,000, so that she can purchase more stock to sell.  This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rosene aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Chill\u00e1n es conocida como \u201cCuna de la Patria\u201d o \u201cTierra de Artistas\u201d, debido a que en la ciudad han nacido destacados personajes de la historia de Chile, como por ejemplo el conocido pianista Claudio Arrau.\n","en":"This communal bank is called \"Looking at the Future\" and is composed by 17 members who are dedicated to differing activities, among them the making of empanadas, tortillas, sale of firewood and coal, also sale of groceries in a mini market.  They are all from the city of Chilan.  Nancy, who in the picture is in the first row, second from the right, is dressed in a black jacket, pink polo shirt and boots on top of her jeans.  She has been a seamstress for the last 21 years, and has a shop in her home. \r\nNancy makes her clothing based on the season and the orders she receives from her customers.  Her customers are frequently students during the school season, for the independence holiday season (Chilean independence day festivities) her clothing is based on native folk attire.  Starting with the month of August her sales increase due to the making, renting and selling of costumes.  In her shop Nancy has the necessary machinery to carry out her craft, an overlock machine, a multipoint and a straight machine.  She says that her sales are doing well. \r\nShe buys her supplies in stores that specialize in sewing supplies.  \r\nWith the loan she will buy material, elastic, thread and sequins, specifically supplies to make costumes.\r\nHer goals are to continue working in her business to increase her income.  She would like to perfect her ability to make costumes and she wishes to have a store specializing in the sale and rental of these.\r\nNancy lives with her husband and two children of 11 and 13 years of age.  Her dreams for her family are for her children to become independent and professionals.  She also finds herself helping her husband with the start of a grocery store business.\r\nNancy is very happy and grateful with the help that she gets from the Esperanza Fund.  She says that the meetings have been a way to meet and share experiences from different point of view.  This way confidence and solidarity is generated with the other member of the communal bank group.  Besides, the group is very caring and committed.  \r\nChill\u00e1n is a community in the south central area of Chile.  The name means \" seat of the sun\" in mapudungun, the language of the indigenous Mapuches.  Chill\u00e1n is known as the \"cradle of the country\" or \"land of artists\", due to several famous persons in Chile's history being born there, as for example the known pianist Claudio Arrau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":796815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She is now 32 years old and lives with her husband and 1-year-old daughter in Bayanhongor province, one of Mongolia's central provinces. Her husband currently stays home and takes care of the baby.\r\n\r\nSelenge used to mine for gold by hand like many locals do at the gold-mining site. She gave up the dirty mining and decided to sell clothes at the local market. Since July 2008, she has been renting a small stall at the local black market and retailing women\u2019s and men\u2019s clothes. She purchases inventory clothes from China, where many of cheap products flood into the country and resells them at her stall. She hopes to expand her business and rent one more stall to sell more clothes.\r\n\r\nSelenge requests a loan to purchase more inventory for her retail business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About XacBank:<\/b>\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

G. is a 48-year-old married woman who lives in Nangka, Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by running a rice retailing business.\r\n\r\nHer husband, Ricardo, is 51 years old and works driving a habal habal (a single motorcycle that is the only mode of transportation in most  mountainous areas). They have two children who are 20 and 21 years old.  One works as a delivery boy and the other helps her parents in their business.\r\n\r\nRosemarie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in the rice retailing business. Now she earns an average monthly income of $326 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nRosemarie is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP was used to fund the operations of her rice retailing business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is on her 15th cycle loan, in the amount of 23,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her rice retailing business. Rosemarie is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

It's in the province of the same name and in the Libertad region, over an hour away from the city of Chiclayo, capital of the Lambayeque region.  \r\n\r\nHe offers transportation services to passengers and cargo with his mototaxi (a motorized vehicle consisting of a motorcycle with a compartment for the purpose of transportation).  He offers this service in the district where he lives and, thanks to the income it generates, he covers his personal costs and helps support his family.  This business is in high demand in the area and is relatively economical and quick.  \r\n\r\nContant use during the time he has been working with his vehicle has meant that the vehicle has begun having several problems and needs constant maintenance to keep it working.  This is why he is requesting from Edpyme Alternative a loan of 1500 nuevos soles.  Carlos is an honest person and very hardworking.  His dearest wish is to continue working hard to be able to take care of his parents and give them a better quality of life.  He worked previously with Nuestra Institucion and showed punctuality and responsibility for achieving his quotas.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Nadine Riopel, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":593328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Repair and maintenance costs for a mototaxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chep\u00e9n, La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-08-31T19:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":104.74},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106.6},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":111.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":115.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":117.72},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":121.65},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":128.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":129.23},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":135.52},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":138.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":143.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":147.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.4},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.09},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.9},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.6},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.08},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.38},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.9},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.4,"local_amount":104.74,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":107.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099628},{"amount":39.09,"local_amount":106.6,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":109.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177555004},{"amount":40.9,"local_amount":111.55,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":114.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530398},{"amount":42.22,"local_amount":115.15,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:54:51Z","rounded_local_amount":118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666523},{"amount":43.17,"local_amount":117.72,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":120.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409848},{"amount":44.6,"local_amount":121.65,"processed_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":124.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108281},{"amount":301.62,"local_amount":822.59,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":843.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270417}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T16:16:06Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:48:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nadine Riopel","image":496782}},{"id":231888,"name":"Benjamin Kiprotich","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benjamin Kiprotich M. is a 32-year-old man who is married to Ursila Jepchirchir.

Zenaida Requentosa, 47, is one kind of a typical mother. She was not able to go to high school, but because she is a community partner in CCT*, she receives entrepreneurial training and biblical encouragement to help her start and run her own business. Zeny, as she is called by friends, is the wife of Rodrigo, a mason, and the loving mother of three children who are all in high school.  They live in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nZeny runs a business in which balut (fertilized duck egg with an undeveloped embryo) is made and sold to the community. Balut is a common food in the country and is often sought after at night. Zeny capitalizes on this big market and produces quality balut. She also adds fish and pork crackers, which are the best accompaniment for balut. Zeny has been in this business for seven years  and earns around Php12,000 every month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Zenaida seeks a Php17, 000 loan. She intends to use this to improve her balut-making business\u2014buying quality ingredients, paying hired men, and other business expenses. She is sure that the loan will increase the profitability of her business and will help finance the schooling of her three children.\r\n\r\nZenaida worries about the financial stability of her family.  There are times when the balut sales are low, and some customers who borrow do not pay. Nevertheless, she does not give up hoping and believing that her business will grow, and that it will be God\u2019s way of blessing her family with a life of peace and good health.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":719935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Balut-Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more raw balut eggs for selling ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Baseco, Manila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-25T20:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":106.67,"local_amount":4533.32,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4660.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256848},{"amount":106.66,"local_amount":4533.32,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4660.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123541},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":5666.65,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5825.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194862},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2266.71,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2330.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474000}],"funded_date":"2011-02-25T22:55:46Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":281063,"name":"Julio Cesar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julio Cesar es un hombre muy trabajador y ha demostrado ser un excelente cliente.

She is a cheerful, friendly and enterprising woman. She lives with her spouse, with whom she has three children aged 20, 17 and 12 years old. The oldest is independent and with his own family, while the two youngest still depend on her and her spouse to have a good education. She lives in her own house where she shares her days with her spouse who also works a lot to offer a better quality of life to their family. Disnarda's job is selling all types of bread, beverages and ice cream flavored with regional fruit, of which there are many because of the intense heat in the area. She sells all of the products in her house, where her customers go. On the other hand she works for some people harvesting citrus, which generates additional income for the home. She has been doing these activities for three years and she started by selling a little, and now her business has stabilized. She loves working like this, since she managed her own schedule and generates income for her family. She has a lot of plans for the future, but at this time she just wants to consolidate her work and in the future expand her business. This will be her first loan with MFP. She is very excited to know that they will offer her financial backing in order to start to invest more in her business. She is very committed to making her payments on time and be able to integrate quickly into the communal bank, since it is a very solid and above all responsible group.

Lagay, Brgy. Su-ay, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She is 57 years old and is married to Joel J., who works as a tailor. Rosalinda supplements her husband's income by raising pigs and vegetable farming.  She works hard to improve the living condition of her family, providing for all their basic needs, education and future security. \r\n\r\nIn January 2005, Rosalinda knew that the little she and her husband earned would not meet the needs of their child, so she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could borrow enough capital to start her general store. When she received her loan, she bought the most sellable products to sell in her store, and she reinvested the income into the business as revolving working capital. As her business continued to improve, she was also able to help advance her husband's business with some of her loans from NWTF-PD. Their combined monthly net income averages around PHP 13,000 and they invest most of it back into their respective businesses, after taking some out to cover their household expenses.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan she borrowed Php 13,000 as additional capital for her general store. She paid back the loan in weekly installments and was able to fully pay it back within the loan term. Now she is borrowing PHP 10,000 for her eighth cycle loan, which she intends to use as additional capital for her general store and also to buy a pig to raise and sell after a few months. The income from this loan will be used for their household expenses, school expenses, and as capital for fish vending.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc., has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":407569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Each day, Mari strives to keep her store stocked with basic goods as well as products that are in high demand. \r\n\r\nOver time, not only have their children grown, but so has their need for an education, clothing, shoes etc.  Her husband decided to go to the United States when the income from the store no longer was sufficient to meet their family's needs.\u2028  Mari's needs prompted her to request a loan to be put towards her business. With the loan, she was able to buy rice, beans, eggs, oil, milk, canned chili peppers, salt, cookies, some soft drinks and bottled juice. She has related to us that with this assistance her business is improving and she is able to offer more products to her clients. The money she earns goes toward loan payments, reinvestments and purchasing necessary items. \r\n\r\nThe challenge Maria is facing is with competing stores.  It can be difficult at times to maintain her business due to the raise in the price of commodities as well as the increasing number of near by businesses.  The advantage Maria has is that she does not have to pay rent because her business is located in her home.  However, what is not in her favor is the limited space she has for her products because of the small size of the room where the store is located.  \r\n\r\nMaria indicates that in spite of everything her business is doing well and she hopes to make it grow more. She would like to increase the size of the space where her store is located in order to stock it with more products. She would also like to improve her housing and see her children study in a career track. Maria is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the loan. Receiving it and learning how to invest it have been a great help. Maria wishes the best to all those who have made the assistance possible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":685875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"The loan request described below is to purchase food products and staple goods such as; rice, beans, soup ingredients, milk, sugar, canned chili peppers, canned beans, canned sardines and tuna, salt, eggs, laundry detergent, body soap etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-14T02:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Estela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2273.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430836},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2273.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850089},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2273.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292363},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2273.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160621}],"funded_date":"2011-01-14T11:24:22Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tyson Shelley","image":null}},{"id":268787,"name":"Michelle","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Michelle E. is from the village of ZNAC, Tampilisan, Zamboanga del Norte.

Sin ayuda de nadie, empujando su carrito, Demetria sale todas las noches a vender sus deliciosos salchimotes (comida hecha a base de mote frito y rodajas de salchichas), los cuales son degustados por las personas que pasan por su puesto, muchos de los cuales llegan a comerse hasta 3 o 4 platos, su negocio es muy rentable, debido a los bajos precios que tienen sus salchimotes. Ella disfruta cuando sus clientes alaban su deliciosa saz\u00f3n, pero no le gusta tener que soportar el congelante fri\u00f3 que hace por la noches. Ya lleva 10 a\u00f1os en este negocio y ha decidido que es hora de mejorarlo, en el futuro quiere vender m\u00e1s salchimotes  y tener m\u00e1s ingresos, para mejorar su vida. Demetria es una de las socias m\u00e1s amables de su banco comunal, siempre es muy activa en sus reuniones y ahora se encuentra en su segundo pr\u00e9stamo, ella siempre ha pagado todas sus cuotas a tiempo, aunque para ello tenga que amanecerse vendiendo salchimote.

Although the house does not yet have electricity, she doesn't get discouraged and is determined to get ahead with the business she started. Without anyone's help, Demetria goes out pushing her little cart every night to sell her delicious salchimotes (a food made of fried corn and sliced sausages), which are sampled by passersby. Many people end up eating three or four plates. Her business is doing very well, thanks to her low-priced salchimotes. She loves it when customers praise their delicious flavor, but she doesn't like having to endure the freezing cold at night. She's worked in this business for 10 years and has decided to improve it. In the future she'd like to send more salchimotes and earn a larger income in order to improve her life. Demetria is one of the friendliest members of her \"banco comunal\" (communal bank); she's always very active in meetings and is now on her second loan. She has always made her payments on time, even if she's had to stay up all night selling salchimote to do it. With the money from this loan, Demetria wants to refurbish her salchimote cart and buy more ingredients for preparing her delicious food. She can manage all this at a cost of about 800 nuevos soles, and hopes in that way to have a better future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":267297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Refurbish the cart she uses to sell food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-07T19:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Demetria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":134.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117020},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":134.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117021},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":134.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011939},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:09Z","rounded_local_amount":134.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989780},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":134.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989781},{"amount":42.2,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":136.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210917}],"funded_date":"2009-02-07T20:06:01Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":91773,"name":"Adijat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adijat A. is a 50-year-old married woman with four children.

Its a good place to maintain livestock for his home and business. From a young age he turned animals out to pasture; now, having experience in raising animals to market weight, he himself buys and sells livestock. Everyone in the village keeps livestock. He and his neighbors alternate taking the animals to pasture in the mountains where there is food (grass). They agree on whose turn it is to take cows to pasture and goats to the meadow. So for one month Abduhalil, or another of his neighbors, tend the animals, to protect them from wolves another any other dangerous situations. \r\nHe is a bookkeeper for the village council.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":396895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-30T15:40:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868316},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757512},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146606},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984751},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:13Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015424},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740430}],"funded_date":"2009-09-30T19:09:14Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Zev Lowe","image":830984}},{"id":145115,"name":"Lanie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lanie G. lives in the village of Brgy. Abahaw, Hinigaran Negros Occidental. She is 40 years old and is married to Dionito G. who is presently engaged in buying and selling cows, hogs and other farm animals. She has three young children who are between 1 to 16 years old, with the older two kids going to school. She aspires to be able to send all her children to college and earn their degrees so that they can have their own careers and be independent.\r\n\r\nWhen she started, Lanie had little knowledge of handling a general store but she tried her luck, and was willing to learn from each experience, because it was the easiest way to earn money and help her husband earn a living. She asked for capital from her husband and invested it in a general store, but she is happy because she is proving that she can do it and help her family at the same time. She discovered that she enjoyed being in business and continued to improve operations until she realized that she needed a fresh infusion of capital to take her business to the next level.\r\n\r\nShe joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 so that she could add to her current capital and invest it in a general store. As time moved on and her business steadily improved with each new loan, she was able to help her husband in his business as well. Now the combined monthly net income of their two businesses earns approximately PHP 8,000, which goes a long way in defraying the family's expenses.\r\n\r\nIn the previous loan, she borrowed Php 19,500 and used it for her general store business and the livestock business of her husband. This amount was paid in weekly installments and was fully paid without any delays. Now she is borrowing  Php 22,000 for her 15th cycle loan which she intends to use as additional capital for her general store and to buy more livestock to sell. The income from it will be used to improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":406608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
