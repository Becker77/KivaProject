She has been working there for three years, and manages to support her parents, as she still lives with them.  She is single, and plans to take a course in English.  \r\n\r\nHer goal has been to have a better roof for her parents, and she opted for a loan to build her own room, which is still not finished.  But it is also really important for her to put a roof on the area behind the house. This will consist of a covered porch and tiled area.  This is because water is getting into the house, and they want to deal with that situation. \r\n\r\nShe will buy construction materials such as zinc sheeting, purlins( structural roof members), sheet metal screws, cement, and iron, then start construction. This is the most viable approach, as she is spreading out her costs, and continuing to support her parents.  In the process, she is completing her own home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":864363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy construction materials to build a covered porch and tile the area behind her house.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T23:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janina De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.47,"local_amount":1210.5,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1231.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238531078},{"amount":52.38,"local_amount":1164.09,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1184.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244490743},{"amount":62.36,"local_amount":1385.87,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:06:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1409.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250699018},{"amount":60.25,"local_amount":1338.86,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1362.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257102963},{"amount":77.76,"local_amount":1727.94,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:10:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1757.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269953130},{"amount":24.72,"local_amount":549.34,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":558.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276559534},{"amount":36.73,"local_amount":816.23,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":830.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286782146},{"amount":81.33,"local_amount":1807.17,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1838.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294509534}],"funded_date":"2011-09-18T23:09:51Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:16:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":337574,"name":"Buenafe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Buenafe is 35 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She is 52 years old. Elizabeth is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Elizabeth owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Elizabeth has been engaged in her business for more than four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elizabeth joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Elizabeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Elizabeth is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Elizabeth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

As soon as they obtained a piece of land from the state, she did not think twice and quickly started keeping cattle. After fattening the cattle, she is reselling them and buying more. Now her joint monthly income comes to around $211. Considering her initial investment of $45, she is doing pretty well! Gulziya hopes to obtain this loan to purchase fuel and sugar for making jam. Gulziya has many plans for the future. Very soon, she is going to make a grand repair of her house. \r\n\r\nGulziya's partners: \r\n\r\nSaltanat A., 31, has two children.

They have five children who are between 12 and 25 years old. \r\n\r\nChineta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Chineta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 3,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she could continue to save up for future business expansion. \r\n\r\nChineta V. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

Using a capital of 20,000 som (KGS), Medetkan became involved in breeding and reselling livestock in 2010.  Today, his farm, containing 10 cows, 7 horses and 10 goats, yield a profit of about 8,000 som per month.  In addition, Medetkan provides a tractor driving service to the local residents during the period of farm work, and this activity serves as a not-so-bad source of income for his family.  In order to further develop his business, Medetkan requested a loan in the sum of 70,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock.  He plans to complete the construction of his house with the help of this loan and buy a tractor in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":884521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kichi-Aral village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Medetkan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":40487.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938335},{"amount":43.87,"local_amount":1949.71,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013733},{"amount":631.13,"local_amount":28050.29,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:23:07Z","rounded_local_amount":28392.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777256}],"funded_date":"2011-10-31T00:46:34Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T11:23:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":345796,"name":"Apolinaria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Apolinaria is a hard-working entrepreneur who has an egg  selling business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 15,000 through NWTF to purchase more boxes of eggs to sell in her stall.\r\n\r\nApolinaria has been in this business for nine years.

Monica's desire is to continue working to progress and, in the future, to have a larger business.

She is 43 years old. Loreta is widowed and has 2 adult-aged children. To make a living, Loreta owns & operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Loreta has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Loreta joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Loreta is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Loreta from HSPFI.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts by working hard in her general store and hog raising businesses.  She is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 5,000 PHP. Maria Flor is now borrowing 19,500 PHP to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Maria Flor aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He began his business because he felt he should be self-reliant. Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about SLL 2,190,200 every month from this business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She walks through the farms and several settlements to buy cattle at the lowest price to be able to increase her profits. She currently has two cows and four calves. Now Ominajon wants to expand her business. Since her children are grown up, she thinks that she will be able to look after more cattle with their help.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She found out about this loan source from someone she knew and decided to form a group of longtime friends.  And, thus, together they formed the Independence Group. \r\n\r\nShe sells snacks at a primary school near her community.  Maria has been doing this for 34 years, just as her mother did when she was born.  And now Maria continues the business and supports her family.  At present, she has two vending carts and wants to enlarge her business a bit more.\r\n\r\nFor her, the business is important since it has enabled her to help her children advance.  She tends one cart while her sister tends the other.  Her business is well known and loved by all the children at the school.  She thinks this is due to her good personality and the economic prices she charges.  Maria plans to buy another cart to see if she can make her business grow.  Maria is confident that she can do this.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the group sells clothes, shoes, and prepared food.  The community where they live is Rio Blanco.  There are many commercial stands and nearby is the municipal palace and park.  She is happy that she can count on the help of the Realidad La UDE Foundation.\r\n\r\nHer Group is made up of Reynalda, Concepcion, Domitila, Leonor, Magdalena, Carolina, Laura, L., Maria Guadalupe,

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is now requesting an amount of PHP 10,000 as her 3rd cycle loan to be used for additional capital for her existing businesses. The future income from this loan will be used to improve her family's living conditions, to meet their basic needs, to repay loans to PMPC and for savings, the children\u2019s education and possible business expansions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is hoping to have a long life so that she can continue her mission in life. ASHI is her second family; she found it through staff and her co-members.

That\u2019s why Estella is very happy and motivated all day.\r\n \r\nHer previous loan from KIVA provided working capital to expand her business and purchase more inventory for her store. Positive growth from her business has helped Estella finance her needs. Since joining ASHI, Estella has experienced positive changes in her life, using the additional income to support her nephew who has enrolled in a doctorate degree in university. Estella hopes her business will continue to flourish so she can provide long-term financial stability for her family. Therefore, she is now requesting another KIVA loan, this time for 45,000 PHP, to purchase more inventory of food for her store. This will allow her to grow her business further so that her nephew can fulfill her dreams of completing a doctorate degree and experiencing a life that\u2019s full of contentment.\r\n\r\nEstella\u2019s one hope in life is to have savings in the future for her retirement because she\u2019s now getting older. Thanks in advance to all supporters for funding this loan. Again, this is a great opportunity for making her dreams come true.

Satou expects to make an average monthly profit of 10,000 CFA francs which she will use to pay the loan installments and for her family's expenses, and the rest will be reinvested in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":671509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy condiments\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Klacouma","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-12-21T20:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimata                                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":27049.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188752147},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":27049.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606420},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":27049.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195918069},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":27049.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360998},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-17T08:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":27049.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226304},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":27049.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301168}],"funded_date":"2010-12-21T21:55:02Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Puchner","image":669957}},{"id":263845,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn, a married mother of three children between the ages of 19 and 22, lives in San Remegio, Cebu, where she has two businesses:  a general store and a load retailer venture.  Her husband Renato F., 47, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.<p>\r\n\r\nEvelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,600, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to buy more groceries for the general store to resell so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and the children's education. Evelyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

is a young man of 27 and is married but does not have children. He is the only child of a single mother and was never able to count on the support of his father. Because of this, he helped his mother with the household income from the time he was very young. When he was 12 years old, he began selling blankets in the streets, a traditional activity in Carapegu\u00e1. When he was 15 years old, he began selling things on his own, working hard even when it was cold, raining, or very hot, always enthusiastic and with a desire to get head. <p>After several years of sacrifice and saving, he began another business with his new companion in life. He and his wife opened a bar where they sell fast food and also grocery items. He wishes to return to selling woven blankets, because his wife handles the bar very well, and in order to increase their income, he wants to begin selling blankets again. He is asking for a credit of $450.00, which he will use to buy various types of blankets. This will help him prepare to receive the children he and wife dream so much of having. <p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b> <p>Marcial es un joven de 27 a\u00f1os, casado pero sin hijos.

fishing business.  She lives in Purok 3, Brgy. Linaon, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her fishing business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average income of PHP20,000. \r\n\r\nEvangeline is now borrowing PHP 25,000 so she can build a new pump boat.  This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP22,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Evangeline aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

P. is a 25 year-old woman who learned from her mother how to be independent and make income for herself and for her personal growth.  It was her mother's example that Jenny observed during her childhood that spurred her, in 2008, to start earning her own money and become self-sufficient, starting businesses that her observant nature allowed her to see as profitable.\r\n\r\nJenny started out selling handicrafts that she produces in her own workshop such as backpacks and bags.  She currently displays her products in the general store she has in her own home.  She has gradually added other products such as footwear, spare parts and many articles that people need in their daily lives.\r\n\r\nJenny also sells 'arepas' (corn pancakes), 'carima\u00f1olas' (traditional Colombian fritters stuffed with cheese and meat and fried) and other fried food from the door of her home every day.  She has also taken a course on servicing and fixing cell phones and taken advantage of the knowledge she gained to start offering this service too.  She knows how to do business with these items and sell spare parts, cases, keyboards and covers for them.  Jenny's net profits for this business are 550,000 Colombian pesos which represent a 30% sales profit.  She uses her profits to support her family's expenses and has managed to pay for her education as a marketing technologist.  She hopes to finish this course successfully.\r\n\r\nJenny's Kiva loan is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo.

She is the chairlady of Inkiramat women group. Nayioma attends the group\u2019s monthly meetings and takes group work very seriously. She encourages other members to work hard, save and prepare for their children\u2019s education. She is a time conscious lady and to discourage lateness during monthly group meetings, she introduced a penalty. She sells milk and steers at Isinya town and to two hotels in Kitengera town. Currently she has only 12 cows and she gets 30 litres of milk per day. This gives her $10 per day. Being a single mother, she has to work hard to increase her income and this is why she wants to start selling steers in order to increase her income inflow. This is the only way she will be able to educate her children and maintain good standard of living. To Nayioma and her group members, the revival of the Kenya Meat Commission is a blessing because it\u2019s providing ready market for cattle in the whole area.

The livestock business is the most popular business in the rural area and thus provides a profit.<p>\r\nToday, Mahmadalli\u2019s working capital has decreased due to the cold winter and he had to sell several calves in order to buy feed for the rest and now he needs to expand his inventory.  This is why he needs a loan.  This will allow him to restore his business and income which his family needs.

From the time she was a girl she helped on the small farm, but now that she has her own children she only plants potatoes and corn for their own consumption. 6 years ago she opened a neighborhood store, which she began with a few products, and as time has passed it has continued to grow. At the same time, she has not stopped planting on her small farm, and a few years ago she began raising sheep. In the later hours of the day she closes her neighborhood store to take her sheep into the fields. Sonia enjoys being in contact with people, however, sometimes she finds it difficult when there is not enough money to stock her business. For that reason, she plans to dedicate more of her time to her small farm by planting peas in an effort to earn additional money to invest in her business.

She and her husband have wanted to improve the house for 10 years.  During the summer, Flor operates a business selling cold drinks along the beach.  This extra income helps, with her husband's income, to move the project along.  Over the years, they have been working on the framing, walls and roof of their much-desired house.  Flor is happy with the progress they have made together.  Her goal now is to treat the walls for insects.  Next, she wants to tile the floors.  Her overall goal is to provide a comfortable place for her children to live.  This is Flor's first MFP loan.  She knows that it will help her to continue building her house and, consequently, she is committed to repaying the loan on time.  She will use the money from the loan to buy tubing for the house's lighting, along with sand, cement and other building materials.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

Antelma tiene una papeler\u00eda en su domicilio, negocio que inicio desde hace mas de 4 a\u00f1os aproximadamente, lo que la  motivo a iniciar este negocio en primer lugar fue la necesidad de la gente que habita en la poblaci\u00f3n, ya que existe un gran n\u00famero de ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes que estudia en diferentes escuelas dentro y fuera de la comunidad y que carecen de materiales did\u00e1cticos necesarios para elaborar sus tareas y trabajos escolares, antes de iniciar la papeler\u00eda los pobladores ten\u00edan que viajar a la ciudad de Pinotepa para adquirir sus productos, haciendo mas costosos los precios de los materiales did\u00e1cticos necesarios para la educaci\u00f3n de los estudiantes de su pueblo.\nAntelma   se uni\u00f3 a un grupo de cr\u00e9dito para solicitar un cr\u00e9dito de dinero, para la compra de material did\u00e1ctico y de papeler\u00eda, como son: libretas, cuadernos, pegamento blanco, l\u00e1pices de colores, l\u00e1pices de grafito, bol\u00edgrafos, tijeras, carpetas, cartulina, hojas de papel Bond, juegos geom\u00e9tricos, regla de medir, comp\u00e1s para trazar c\u00edrculos, \u00e1bacos, crayones, clips, cartuchos de engrapadoras, papel lustre, papel crepe.\nLas ganancias que Antelma, son destinadas par la compra  de mas  materiales y mercanc\u00eda necesaria para su papeler\u00eda, tambi\u00e9n para cubrir los pagos de su cr\u00e9dito. Otro de los proyectos que esta admirable mujer va a emprender es un ciber caf\u00e9, por la necesidad de este servicio en su comunidad, ya que las personas que estudian carecen de esta indispensable herramienta para su preparaci\u00f3n escolar.\nLa esperanza que tiene Antelma, es tener buena salud para seguir aportando los medios necesarios que su pueblo requiere para un buen  desarrollo, hacer crecer su negocio, mejorarlo en todos los aspectos, ampliar su papeler\u00eda, impulsar sus proyectos, y que su situaci\u00f3n familiar siempre este estable y llena de armon\u00eda y comunicaci\u00f3n.\nLo que mas desea es que  sus compa\u00f1eras de grupos no dejen de hacerse responsable con su cr\u00e9dito que a todas ellas les valla de lo mejor, de igual manera desea que los ni\u00f1os que dependen de estas familias no les falte nada.\nAntelma agradece la confianza que le da fundaci\u00f3n realidad, al otorgarle su cr\u00e9dito, a Kiva que sin conocerlas le brindan este gran respaldo econ\u00f3mico.\nEl grupo \u201cDalias de Rancho Viejo\u201d, se conforma por un total de 13 mujeres, que a continuaci\u00f3n se dan los nombres de las personas que lo integran, as\u00ed como su actividad personal de cada integrante.\n\nYuvanitzi Semei F.

It is about 17 minutes from Pinotepa Nacional.  The name comes from the dahlia flower for its unique beauty and because each of the members feels represented by and identifies with this floral species.  The group is made up of 13 women and their representative is Mar\u00eda Isabel R. M..\r\n\r\nWe will focus this narrative on the life of Antelma R. C. who is 45 years old and married to Rosaelio who is 44.  He is an elementary school teacher.  They have 3 children, Cinthia who is 9 and in 4th grade, Darinel who is 8 and in 3rd grade and Rosaelio who is 6 and just started first grade.  Antelma has a stationers business in her home and has been working at this for over four years.  She set up the business because there was a need for school materials for all the children who study in the community.  Before she began her business everyone had to go to the city of Pinotepa to buy everything and this made it all more expensive.\r\n\r\nAntelma joined the group to apply for a loan to buy school materials and stationery suppliers such as notebooks, binders, glue, colored pencils, lead encils, pens, scissors, folders, cardboard, Bond paper, geometric games, rulers, compasses, abacus, crayons, clips, staples, tissue paper, crepe paper.\r\n\r\nAntelma's earnings are used to buy more materials and goods for her store and also to pay back her loan.  This admirable woman also wants to set up a cyber cafe because her community needs one and the students do not have this very necessary tool available for their education.\r\n\r\nAntelma hopes to have good health so she can continue contributing to the needs of her town.  She wants to develop and expand her business and improve it in all regards.  She wants to carry out all her projects and maintain a stable, harmonious lifestyle for her family.\r\n\r\nWhat she hopes for most is that her group colleagues are able to pack back the loan, and that things go well for all of them so that their children have what they need.\r\n\r\nAntelma appreciates the confidence shown by Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and by Kiva in granting this type of economic support.

After working in the multiservice industry (which offers clients access to legal, notary, and tax services) for 10 years, Perla realized that she could offer these services to a community that she felt needed them most.\r\n\r\nOriginally from Monterrey, Mexico, Perla began working in the multiservices industry in the U.S. when she was 16, gaining experience as a notary with a local multiservice company in Houston, Texas. The work was immediately gratifying to Perla because, as she says, she was \u201cdoing something for somebody that they wouldn\u2019t be able to take care of on their own.\u201d From her first job, Perla worked constantly to better herself and the community around her. Growing up with a strong sense of family values, she balanced work, school, and family responsibilities as she grew her experience in the business. \r\n\r\nWhile Perla valued all of the clients she served in the early years of her career, she found working with clients in the Hispanic communities in Houston particularly fulfilling. Many of these clients were members of low-income families with little or no education on how to complete the complex legal forms necessary to live in the United States. Because she was helping people with such unique needs, these clients quickly found a place in Perla\u2019s heart. As a result, she slowly began to work independently with non-English speakers and their families to manage and file complicated immigration materials alongside her full-time work with larger multiservice companies.\r\n\r\nNow, at 26, Perla is ready to take her business expertise to the next level. She says that she has been ready to start her own business for a few years but has been unable to do so for financial reasons. With this loan, she will make her dream come true. She will use the money to purchase office equipment and supplies for her at-home office space, professional business software to design a website and print business cards, and a color laser printer to offer her clients more prompt and reliable printing and copying services. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she hopes for her business in the coming years, Perla remains faithful to her family-oriented upbringing: \u201cI hope to turn this into a family business\u2026.to move our business into a location where our services are most needed.\u201d\r\n\r\nWithout her loan, Perla says she wouldn\u2019t have been able to turn her dream into a reality. With this in mind, her advice to aspiring entrepreneurs is to \u201cnever give up on your dreams. It might take a while, but, if you stay with it, something good is bound to happen.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":8675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8675,"image":{"id":803747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She has a long walk to leave and get to the community.  There are many corn fields in her neighborhood that the residents plant to have corn and make hand-made tortillas and they use the grass to feed their animals.  Planting corn is very hard work and takes a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nPascuala is 19 years old and has been in a common law relationship for two.  She lives in her in-laws\u2019 house and has a one-year-old son.  Her husband works as a bricklayer and knows how to do a lot of things related to construction work while Pascuala raises pigs to sell and have some profits.  \r\n\r\nShe mentions that pigs and sheep are the animals people seek to make food when they have parties or to be able to sell, like people who sell tacos, for example.  Because of this she decided to raise pigs.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest difficulty is the feed because they eat a lot and spend all day eating and because she does not have a lot of grass available to feed them she has to buy it sometimes.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
