B. is 38 and lives in the La Magdalena neighborhood in southern Barranquilla with his wife and 4 children, who range in age from 1 to 19 years.  He is a very enterprising man who has sold cheese since he was once left without a job.  A friend taught him the basics of this business.  Now he sells his product by making deliveries on the weekend. On the other days, he sells cherries, apples, and Chilean grapes, but like a good merchant, he retails every kind of merchandise with which he is familiar, especially men's and women's shoes, which he sells on credit.  This is one of the reasons he is requesting a loan in the amount of 1,700,000 Colombian pesos:  to invest mostly in the purchase cheese, which is his star product.  He will also invest some in the purchase of cherries and strawberries and in shoes for men and women.\r\n\r\nHe started his cheese business 12 years ago when he only sold 1-2 pounds.  Now he has more customers and sells 120 kilograms, which he buys in cold, 1\/4 kilogram blocks.  His wife helps him because she works at a company, and she is also thoughtful and tries to earn new customers for him.  His main goal is to educated his children well and to offer them high-quality studies.  This is his biggest challenge.  Later on, he hopes to have his own car so he can take his merchandise to his customers.  Currently he transports his goods on a motorcycle that he pays to use.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva

Malambo is a place where many people come to live from all corners of the country.  In the neighborhoods of this town, there are a lot of informal businesses.  One can also find the Malambo S.A. \"Pimsa\" industrial park where motorboats come from the US, Central and South America and the Caribbean.\r\n\r\nOrlando has been in business renting out washing machines for 11 years.  His wife is also a hard-working woman who has culinary skills which she uses in her business making cakes and selling soft drinks on a weekend.  These two businesses have allowed the couple to make income for the well-being of their household.  They have gradually expanded their businesses and made important investments in order to help them grow such as, for example, when they bought a cooler and a heated display case, to provide their small businesses with a good image.  They have also made the most of their customer base in order to sell their customers cell phone minutes too.  This makes them additional income.  They also bought a motorcycle taxi which is a common type of vehicle in this area and is used to transport passengers.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Orlando's first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use it to buy four additional washing machines and supplies for making cakes.  His washing machine service has expanded and he often loses customers because he cannot respond in a timely fashion to the great demand that he has.  As a result of this investment, Orlando hopes to improve his profitability and strengthen both his own and his wife's business so that their children can be successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":804775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy four additional washing machines and supplies for making cakes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-07-07T18:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orlando Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78786},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81664},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83229},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84824},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":86450},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":88107},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":89796},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":91517},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":93271},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":95059},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96880},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100417}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.02},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.7},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.45},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.48},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.53},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.02,"local_amount":78786,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":81823.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320466},{"amount":47.7,"local_amount":81664,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:58Z","rounded_local_amount":84812.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803582},{"amount":48.62,"local_amount":83229,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":86437.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614666},{"amount":49.54,"local_amount":84824,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T08:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":88094.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568617},{"amount":50.5,"local_amount":86450,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":89782.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779957},{"amount":51.46,"local_amount":88107,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":91503.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188351},{"amount":52.45,"local_amount":89796,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":93257.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324577},{"amount":53.46,"local_amount":91517,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":95045.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038634},{"amount":225.25,"local_amount":385627,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":400493.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650807}],"funded_date":"2011-07-24T14:12:59Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:44:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":317591,"name":"Bendici\u00f3n De Dios Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veronica is the president of this group comprised of two women and one man living and working in Ibarra, Ecuador.

She is a homebody who is hardworking and responsible. \r\n\r\nVeronica raises, fattens and sells pigs. She started her business with only two pigs. Later, with a loan from FODEMI, she purchased more pigs so that she could sell one or two pigs each month. Veronica says that her work is going well because she has made progress and now has the possibility to grow her business. Veronica\u2019s new loan will be used to buy more pigs and pig feed.

The group is just beginning its first loan cycles. Most of the group members have taken out loans before from other financial institutions, but for four members, this will be their very first loan. \r\n\r\nThe clients are involved in a variety of different businesses: baking and selling bread, selling prepared food (like empanadas and stuffed, fried potatoes), selling locally grown vegetables in the jungle city of Puerto M., selling chicken, cutting and selling eucalyptus trees, renting out retail space, selling grains and dried foods, selling yerba mate at a bus stop, raising livestock and driving a bus. \r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s president, Balvina F., is a member of the local bread sellers\u2019 cooperative, in which there are 62 members, including herself. The cooperative gives internal loans to its members, so Balvina has experience in group loans even though this is her first loan from Asociacion Arariwa. When a member of her cooperative breaks the group\u2019s internal regulations, they are punished by being barred from work for one month. \u201cWe\u2019re worse than the law,\u201d she chuckles. Balvina plans to bring this same disciplined approach to Las Amistosas. \u201cWe must pay on time, faithfully every month, and be punctual,\u201d she says. \u201cThe more punctual we are, the better we work together. We must help one another out.\u201d Balvina also has an innovative plan for the group. She sells bread in Urcos\u2019 Plaza de Armas, and says that on weekends and holidays, there are often many visitors looking for a good meal but little in the way of supply. She has proposed to the group that they take turns selling meals like \u201ccuy\u201d (guinea pig) on the Plaza on these occasions in order to generate reserve savings for the group, in case someone falls ill or can\u2019t make a payment for any reason. \r\n\r\nBalvina plans to use her loan to buy bread flour and animal feed for some cows she has on a small farm she owns. Other group members will use their loans to buy potatoes, rice and oil in bulk; to buy vegetables; to buy chickens; to buy eucalyptus trees; to buy a plot of land; to outfit a restaurant, and to buy animal feed. The \u201cLas Amistosas\u201d group has pledged to repay their Kiva loan on time and in full. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":298272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy bread flour, animal feed, vegetables, oil and rice, chickens, a plot of land, eucalyptus trees and other uses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urcos - Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-04-04T03:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2375,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Balvina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wiliam Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marleni Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicanor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raimunda Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1115.63},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1160.26},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1206.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1254.94},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1305.14},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.06},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":372.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":402.77},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.88},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":358.05,"local_amount":1115.63,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T11:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1126.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35951417},{"amount":372.38,"local_amount":1160.26,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1171.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44409827},{"amount":387.28,"local_amount":1206.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1217.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918261},{"amount":402.78,"local_amount":1254.94,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1266.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139111},{"amount":419.14,"local_amount":1305.95,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:22:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1318.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564729},{"amount":435.37,"local_amount":1356.55,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T13:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1369.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86998331}],"funded_date":"2009-04-06T04:34:17Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T13:07:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Allison Bruce","image":77230}},{"id":103689,"name":"Saua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saua M., 25, is single with no children.

For the past 5 years he has sold food in the evening on a street corner two blocks from his house.  He makes typical local street food such as french fries with sausages, french fries with fried chicken and eggs, and grilled skewers of meat.  His wife supports him in this business, waiting on the customers who come to his stall to try the delicious dishes.  This is not the only activity he has, though - he also has a motorized three-wheel cart that he uses to transport passengers in the mornings, something that he has done for the past 10 years.  What he likes about both businesses is that they keep him active, he is not under a lot of pressure, and the businesses are profitable, producing daily income that allows him to pay for his children's education.  He has already had 4 loans with MFP, and what he enjoys about being in a community bank is that his fellow members are very responsible and hard-working.  The money that he is requesting now will be used to buy tables and chairs, because the ones he has now are not enough for his growing number of customers.

They have three children, two of whom already have their own families. The youngest, who is eleven, lives with them and goes to elementary school. The B. family lives in the village of Purok Pasil (Zone 1) within Cadiz City, located in Negros Occidental province.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a tricycle driver, her husband's earnings can sometimes be erratic. Shuttling people around town in a motorcycle with a passenger sidecar cannot always be counted on as a stable source of income; in bad and rainy weather, his income can be virtually nil. Knowing this pushed Aida to make use of her tailoring skills to supplement her husband's income and provide their family with a steadier income.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2000 Aida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon and, using an NWTF loan plus her dressmaking and tailoring skills, she began a tailoring business. Because she was a good designer and a skilled seamstress, she soon had many loyal patrons who regularly went to her when they needed clothes. Her tailoring business earns an average monthly income of 5,000 PHP, enough to pay for her daughter's school expenses as well as defray some of their household expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 9,500 for working capital for her business was paid on time and in full without delay. Now she is requesting a loan of the same amount for working capital for her tailoring business, and her profits will be used to help supplement the family income.\r\n<p>\r\nThe above picture shows Mrs. Aida B. with her husband, Alfredo, in her tailoring shop.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

She is a nurse by profession and used to work as such in a clinic. On some occasions Yovanna performed other particular duties to obtain more earnings. Her husband is a sailor and used to be sent from one place to the other, for which she always had to leave her jobs. For the well-being of her family Yovanna decided to have her own business and began selling cosmetics. She has many friends to whom she offers her products, and sells 6 different brands. In this way she earns more, and she also makes and sells chocotejas (a type of sweet). With her business Yovanna can contribute to her childrens' studies. In the future she wants to change direction and what she is most anxious to have is a tourist restaurant and prepare tipical regional food.

J., 42 years of age, is married and is a resident of P3 Manabay, Ozamiz City. Elena is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Elena S. J.\u2019s Group.\n\nElena is married to Danilo S. J., a forklift operator with an average net income of P3,600 every 15th and 30th day of the month. They are blessed with six children who are all now in their teens.\n\nTo help her husband in supporting their family, Elena decided to engage in a snack-vending business, particularly banana cue (deep-fried banana covered with caramelized brown sugar), and a sari-sari store. For fifteen years already, she has been able to manage this little business and now she is earning an average net income of not less than P1,500 a month which, she said, is so helpful to their family income.\n\nElena joined Paglaum MPC just this year. As a newly recognized member of the PDP-LP (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People) Program of Paglaum MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she is requesting P3,000 as her first loan to add to the capital of her existing business activity which is her sari-sari store and snack-vending business.\n\nThe future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions of Elena\u2019s family, to meet their basic needs, and as savings for future use and for house repair. She is hoping that someday her business will become more progressive and that all her children will finish their studies up to college level.\n\n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":533034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Mario has been engaged in his business for more than two years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mario joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. Mario is requesting a  loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase more scrap metal to sell and as additional working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Mario from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of his children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

For more than 28 years she has sold cosmetics via catalogue as well as some household articles. Every day she travels the streets, making visits to her clients' homes where she offers products via catalogue or samples, in this way maximising her sales. During all this time she has seen that selling her products is profitable, but has its risks in the moment when she sells on credit, but overall it is advantageous as she can structure her time so that she can attend to her family. \r\n\r\nHermelinda has plans in the future, such as to arrange capital and sell more products. This is her sixth loan with MFP and she is very happy knowing that she has financial support.

This place is known for its traditional culture and also because it is only a few minutes from two of the best beaches in the province, San Jacinto and San Clemente.\r\n\r\nArmanda is a founding member of her community bank and she is very happy since, because of the decision they took many years ago, herself and her fellow bank members have been able to receive help.  Armanda is 57 years old.  She is married and has 5 grown-up children.  Three of her children still live with her as well as two grandchildren who she loves as if they were her own children.\r\n\r\nArmanda has a small bakery where she not only bakes and sells bread but also delicious cakes.  She tells us that this is what she most likes doing because she enjoys decorating her cakes which are very much admired by the people who know what she does.

She has one year of experience in this business.  She needs a loan of 1,000 WST to purchase raw ingredients needed to make the products she sells.  She plans to use the profits (estimated to be 250 WST or around $104 per week) to expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Amelia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Amelia 's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Hato Mayor is one the most rural cities in the country, whose economy is dependent on agriculture. Olga is an entrepreneur dedicated to selling jewelry and accessories. She is a young mother of two children who live with her and her long-term partner. She tells us that her most difficult challenge is to study. In her free time, she likes to study.\r\n\r\nOlga is very excited to receive her 4th loan from Esperanza Internacional, after having satisfactorily paid her previous loans and, with each one, taking steps toward growing her business. For about 2 years, she has been negotiating, starting her her first loan in with us. She is planning to invest the latest loan in the purchase of varieties of jewelry and accessories.

He has great experience in cattle breeding because he has practiced it for more than ten years. With time, he has increased his sales and now he needs assistance for investing in his business. The business has been going well and he would like it to continue to grow.\r\n\r\nSafarali applied for a loan of 12,500 TJS to buy young cattle. He and his family thank you very much for the support that you offer them in continuing this business and helping them give their children a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Little by little, her friendliness and good customer service have brought her very close to her customers, who are made up of neighbors, family members, and passers-by.  With this loan of 2,000 nuevos soles, she will buy ingredients for her prepared meals, such as bags of rice and sugar, fish, bunches of bananas, noodles, dozens of oils, and local fruits and vegetables.  She will also install furniture, such as plastic tables and chairs.\r\n\r\nDalmith is a fighter; her dream is to have a restaurant that serves dishes typical of the Peruvian jungle.  She is very appreciative of the Movimiento Manuela Ramos for helping women like herself get the opportunity to make their dreams a reality.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":853554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients such as bags of rice and sugar, meats, fish, bunches of bananas, etc.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tarapoto - San Martin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.501389 -76.365556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2011-08-26T23:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dalmith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.99},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-27T08:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":342.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227083023},{"amount":125,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":342.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232844666},{"amount":125,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":342.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238659552},{"amount":125,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-18T09:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":342.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244613658},{"amount":124.99,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-31T09:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":342.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250828846},{"amount":125.01,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-29T08:53:20Z","rounded_local_amount":342.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257238974}],"funded_date":"2011-08-27T02:12:06Z","paid_date":"2012-02-29T08:53:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyson Trowbridge","image":null}},{"id":334008,"name":"Miriam","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mirian es socia del Banco Comunal Totorilla, tiene 35 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, ella tiene una Marisquer\u00eda de dia y Chifa por la noche, tambien tiene un recreo, es socia de FINCA Peru desde hace 3 a\u00f1os, recuerda que con su primer pr\u00e9stamo se compr\u00f3 una cocina, ella empez\u00f3 su negocio, con una mesita y 4 sillas en un ambiente que le dio su pap\u00e1, de \u00e9sta manera empez\u00f3 su negocio agradece mucho por todo el apoyo que le brindaron, ya que gracias a Finca y la responsabilidad que le ense\u00f1aron, ahora ella tiene todo lo que se propuso, siente que ha progresado, las capacitaciones y el ahorro le ayudan a poder administrar mejor su negocio.

She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Djidjoho of Hetin Sota, located near the hot springs of Dangbo. She also sells fish.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land. <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice,  Honorine K. has requested a loan of 110,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about1.5 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":237962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-01-13T05:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Honorine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821570},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357842},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046892},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938510},{"amount":64.43,"local_amount":31500,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":33247.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396174},{"amount":19.94,"local_amount":9750,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":10290.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904053},{"amount":28.15,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126061}],"funded_date":"2009-01-13T08:02:00Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:25:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83225,"name":"Fagaitaua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fagaitaua F., 41, is married with 6 children.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n<p>\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She makes sure that she earns so that her family can have a better life.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow 13 times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative, a Kiva partner. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy equipment and containers needed for her water-station business. Her two businesses let her earn a profit of 4,000 Philippine pesos per month.  \r\n\r\nNow, with your help, she would like a PHP 16,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying additional containers and additional clothes for her direct-selling business.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that she can have her own variety store someday and prays that she and her children will have a brighter future. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":472804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Water

Ten years ago, she started making felt shoes and boot liners for winter.  She used to live in the countryside but two years ago she moved to town.  Since moving, she has become very busy.  She has started making several new styles and has started to gather a growing clientele.  In order to keep her business growing, she needs some equipment and materials. She needs wool and combing and shaking machines to make the felt.  She also needs materials and detergent to wash the wool and felt.  She has also recently bought a knitting machine and is learning to use it.  As her patterns and product appearance get better, she wants to take on partners and maybe even teach other people how to make it. \r\n\tDoljindolgor lives with her husband and three sons (6, 9, and 12) in Uvurkhangai province.  During the winter her husband drives a taxi and in the summer he goes to the countryside with the boys to tend to the livestock. Doljindolgor is meticulous in her work, hard working, and humble to a fault.  Since she was little, Doljindolgor has always finished what she started and seeing something she has accomplished makes her happy.  \u201cThere is a lot I want to do!\u201d she says.

She is married and the mother of 5 children ranging from 13 to 24 years old. Only the three youngest go to school. She went to school until 4th grade but didn't finish due to lack of conditions.

She started going to school very late and dropped out when her mother lost her job. Years later she moved in with her husband and started renting a house. She then started her own business raising and selling chickens. She has a profit of 8,000 meticais when she sells wholesale to vendors and 6,000 when she sells by the unit to local costumers. \r\n\r\nShe has never had loans from other banks. This is her fourth loan with Hluvuku and second with Kiva. She intends to increase the amount of chickens she raises. Her previous loans were in the amount of 9,200, 7,000, and 10,000 meticais and were used for the same goal. She is confident she will pay the loan back before it is due and request a new loan to build her own coop and leave the rental coop she uses. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

Rosalin is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Rosalin Orcullos\u2019s Group.\r\nRosalin is married to Walther, a security guard of Johanne\u2019s Cuisine. They are blessed with 2 children of school age. To help her husband, she decided to engage in micro business particularly in processing fish ball for her snack vending activity.  For 2 years already, she has been able to maintain the said business activity and this time she is earning an average net income of not less than P3,500.00 a month in which the said amount is so helpful to their family income. Upon hearing the good news of PAGLAUM MPC for being one of the most outstanding cooperative in Northern Mindanao and awarded coop for being Most Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines during the search for COOP-LGU Partnership Award 2006 and awarded for CUMI Performance Award she joined  the cooperative just this year. As a newly recognized member of the PDP-LP Program of PAGLAUM MPC, a micro-finance program that reached out the rural poor, she is requesting an amount of P5,000.00 as her 1st loan to be used for additional capital for her fish ball vending activity.

She is 40 years old, is married, and has 1 school-aged child. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Virgilla has been engaged in this business for more than 15 years and earns approximately 3500 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from the business.\r\n\r\nVirgilla joined PMPC in 2009 to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virgilla has successfully repaid a previous PMPC loan of 10,000 PHP, which she used to purchase breeding livestock. She is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will likewise be used to purchase breeding livestock. This will be her fifth loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

them. Lorna graduated from college and is now raising a family with two children, hand in hand with her husband, Michael. They currently live in Tanza, Cavite.\r\n\r\nThe main business Lorna manages is selling slippers. Also, she is into direct selling of products from beauty brands, like Avon and Natasha. She has been keeping her merchandise at home and sometimes brings them over to her customers\u2019 houses so that they can have a good pick of what suits their taste. Lorna knows the tastes of her regular customers well, having been nine years in this business. Monthly, she is able to earn around Php10,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her businesses, she is requesting a Php18,000 loan. She plans to buy assorted slippers in bulk so that she can offer various options to her customers. She will also use part of the money for the renovation of their house and the studies of her children, while making sure the business stays profitable.\r\n\r\nAt present, Lorna faces problems in her family. Nevertheless, her strength comes from the time she spends praying to the Lord. She knows that if she can endure, she will emerge victorious, as the Word of the Lord says. Lorna sees that part of the victory the Lord will give her is a commercial space in a mall, where potential buyers are close at hand. She hopes for increased profitability so that, in the end, she will be able to help others in need. That, for her, is one big dream she is ready to fulfill.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":711009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

Later, he was influenced by some photographers that he met at that time and decided to become a photographer.  But he didn't have a camera nor money to buy one, so at age 19 he went to South Africa with the idea of getting a job there to save money for a camera.  But he couldn't find work there, so he began working again as a walking merchant in South Africa.  After 2 years, he was able to buy a camera and returned to Mozambique where he continued as a merchant while learning how to use his camera.  Eighteen months later, he began work as a photographer, and at age 23, married his wife, with whom he has a 2 year old son.  His wife tends to their mini market stand while he works in photography.  \r\n<p>This loan will have a positive impact on his business because it will increase the volume of products he can offer and will allow him to buy another camera without having to go to South Africa for work.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Every morning he begins work in the early morning hours at his job in public transportation.  Since Metrado is located far way, there is not access to vehicles.  As a result there is great demand for the service Denis provides, which helps him generate a good income.  In addition to this job, Denis also spends a great deal of time farming.  He has his own land on which he grows coffee and bananas to sell in the city of Pichanaki during times of peak demand.  Denis enjoys pruning branches and harvesting the bananas.  On the other hand, he wants to grow coffee so that he can raise enough capital to buy more farmland.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP and he is grateful for the support of his Communal Bank.

A year and a half ago, she started working independently in multiple businesses.  These include selling blankets, household goods such as pots, as well as organizing social events.  Saby sells her products through catalogs, which gives her customers time to choose the products and goods they want that they can pay for later.  She enjoys both businesses and being able to work independently.  However, Saby says her greatest difficulty is when her customers do not pay their bills on time. She has overcome this problem by enacting collection strategies.  Her greatest wish is to have more capital so that her business will be more profitable.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  Saby is extremely happy to know that she has financial support, so she has always demonstrated responsibility with her payments.  In addition, she is grateful to be part of her group because all the members are responsible and support people.  She thanks those responsible for approving her loan request since the funds will be useful in advancing her businesses.  The loan she requested will be used to by merchandise such as blankets, sheets, and other household goods.

Four years ago, when   Marlenis started providing transportation for children, she saw the market with the mothers of these little ones- the opportunity to sell them merchandise. She started with encouragement from a friend, who was already in the business via a catalogue. In this way, she got her first customers and gradually, with good service and what she was offering, her clientele grew.

He is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary, and he also has a store that sells clothes. Mohammad wants to do a bulk purchase of clothes for the coming winter season so that he can have a new collection for sale, but the amount of money he has isn't enough to pay, so he needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Mohammad gets the loan, he will be able to purchase bulk of winter clothes for sale, so he will have a better, new collection to compete and increase his sales and increase his income. Mohammad is photographed in his store.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

Right now she needs a loan to buy another bale of clothes because most of her funds have been spent on school fees now that the children are reporting for school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4375,"image":{"id":165103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To increase an inventory of used clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rubaga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 32.55","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2008-08-02T04:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":141,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faridah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cissy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shifah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-23T20:57:21Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":7100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1775000},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1775000},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1775000},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1775000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1093.75},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1093.75},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1093.75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1093.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1094,"local_amount":1775405.71,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-24T07:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1778844,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335745},{"amount":1094,"local_amount":1775405.71,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-29T07:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1778844,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369923},{"amount":1093.25,"local_amount":1774188.58,"processed_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1777624.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5344324},{"amount":1093.75,"local_amount":1775000,"processed_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1778437.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9966445}],"funded_date":"2008-08-09T20:57:21Z","paid_date":"2009-01-16T02:35:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":54566,"name":"Hassan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hassan, 32 years old, is married and has 1 child.

Her customers are made up generally of workers (both men and women).<p>\r\nHer business cycle is monthly and she expects to realize a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA.

Inomjon is a very courageous man who is characterized as someone who can manage tough jobs like raising livestock. He's the father of three children and has the responsibility of supporting his family and providing them with everything that they need. \r\n<p>\r\nIn spite of his difficult economic situation, and after much time, Inomjon has been able to get ahead in his business through the purchase of animals to breed on his property. His greatest goal nowadays is to improve his economic situation and provide a better way of life for his family. It's for this reason that Inomjon comes to IMON International for loans for the purchase of animals so that he may breed them.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is divorced and has raised two children on her own, both of whom are at school. Even though her family consists of just three members, Nargiza has to work hard to provide them with a worthy life. She makes a living by selling video and audio CDs, DVDs and mp3 players. Sometimes, she even manages to trade in cattle. She is very fortunate to have a caring brother, who is always by her side at difficult times. When Nargiza leaves her stall to transport goods, he replaces her so that trade is not interrupted.   \r\n<p>\r\nTwo years in business have brought her evident results: purchase of a car for transporting goods, and some convenience goods for her home. Her original investment was $70 USD, and her current monthly income is around $480 USD. Nargiza's plan is to build a house and set her children on their feet by providing them with a good education. For this, Nargiza needs a loan to purchase video and audio CDs, DVDs, children\u2019s school uniform, table napkins and diapers, as she has noticed a growing demand for these goods. \r\n<p>\r\nNargiza\u2019s partners are Nariste, Baktygul, Larisa and Nurlan. Nariste, 26, is married. Her husband is a security guard at a casino, whereas she buys milk products wholesale and sells them at the market. She needs a loan to buy butter, cottage cheese and sour cream. \r\n<p>\r\nBaktygul, 34, has two children. She sells foodstuffs in a small shop. In addition, she sells chewing gum, cigarettes and vitamins, at the city market. Baktygul needs a loan to purchase school equipment, cereals, soft drinks and ice-creams. \r\n<p>\r\nLarisa, 34, is married and has three children. She trades in fish, and her husband is a minibus driver. Larisa needs a loan to purchase frozen fish, school equipment and clothes for her children. \r\n<p>\r\nNurlan, 30, is married with one child. He works as a security guard at two locations. In addition, he manages to keep cattle. He needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<p>\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept: People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further), and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She lives in a small house with her two sons, Wilson (age 22) and Gerber (age 20), who are the reason behind all her efforts.\r\n<p>\r\nNarcissa has been raising cattle in order to forge a decent life for herself.  She learned how to take care of animals at a young age and now her cattle are some of the most sought after livestock being sold in the city of Juliaca.  Narcissa is a native of Taraco (a district in the province of Huancan\u00e9).  She enjoys caring for her animals because the more attention she given them, the higher the prices she can command.  For 30 years, Narcissa has been at her job and says the most difficult part for her is transporting her animals to market because it demands much time and effort.  At some point in the future, she would like to open a grocery store so that she can generate additional income and improve her family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Narcissa feels the responsibility of making her payments on time because she does not want to get in trouble with the other members of her Communal Bank.  She is adored by everyone else because she brings much joy to all of their meetings.  Narcissa will use her loan of 1000 soles to buy a cow, but she needs to save up some additional funds in order to complete the purchase.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":417331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-30T10:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narcisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997708},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843130},{"amount":175.35,"local_amount":501,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":510.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734708},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":168.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992622}],"funded_date":"2009-10-30T12:17:55Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":153052,"name":"Mrs. Moun Sott Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Moun S. lives in Tuol Kdei village in Kandal province, and is part of the Mrs. Moun S.

She sells her merchandise for cash to a customer base composed essentially of housewives.\r\n\r\nWith this first loan she anticipates realizing an average monthly profit of 90,000 CFA that will be used principally to increase her working capital,  contribute to the family\u2019s expenses and to pay the interest on her loan.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Connie Archea, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":560738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase onions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":35464.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699771},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:07Z","rounded_local_amount":35464.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913686},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":35464.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180818},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":35464.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476786},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":35464.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613499},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":35464.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751928}],"funded_date":"2010-07-01T21:35:42Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Connie Archea","image":607010}},{"id":215209,"name":"Leonarda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Leonarda C. tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad y vive en union libre con el Se\u00f1or Rodolfo Rivas quien trabaja en la Empresa Nacional Portuaria.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Mylene has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Mylene joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mylene has successfully repaid a previous loan of 19,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Mylene is requesting a new loan of 23,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Mylene from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It\u2019s time to promote women\u2019s interests in the area of business.\r\n\r\nKanyshai B., 24, is the treasurer of this group. She cannot imagine her life without dance and fitness. She believes in the saying \u201cHealthy spirit is in a healthy body.\u201d She owns a fitness club, where she teaches ladies of all ages how to stay fit. The idea of opening this club was her husband's. He is also an experienced businessman. While on maternity leave, she wrote a business plan for a fitness club. Fortunately, her funds managed to cover all of the expenses, including attracting customers, advertising, and equipment. The income from the business was used to purchase a small piece of land where Kanyshai would like to build a shop. She requests a loan to purchase equipment for running. It is the only thing she lacks in the fitness club. Her dream in the future is to build a health club for women. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

three children. Nineteen years ago in search of a source of income for his family Manasbek started his business selling food and basic goods using the sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Manasbek's store is known for good quality products which are sold at a low price, which is important for people with low incomes. Through persistence and hard work Manasbek was able to develop his business with a monthly income of about 20,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop his business Manasbek turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to expand the product range. Manasbek plans to invest the income from loan in the expansion of retail

de estar unidos siempre y apoyarse entre ellos, ejemplo que les quiere dejar a sus dos hijos para cuando conformen su propio hogar. Desde muy jovencita le gust\u00f3 estar bien arreglada y maquillada, y debido a que invertir en la compra de cosm\u00e9ticos es costoso, tom\u00f3 la decisi\u00f3n de formar parte de las promotoras de belleza de su localidad.  Y desde hace 7 a\u00f1os ha ganado experiencia en realizar esta actividad, ya que para Rosa, el secreto es visitar a varias personas y salir diariamente a ofrecerles productos novedosos a trav\u00e9s de cat\u00e1logos y distribuirlos en las fechas indicadas para tener contenta a su clientela. Ahora tiene la ambici\u00f3n de ser empresaria, pues en las l\u00edneas de belleza motivan a las mujeres a no ser s\u00f3lo promotoras, sino a buscar un equipo a las cuales puedas liderar y capacitar en las ventas, pero sin descuidar sus propios pedidos, por lo que le gustar\u00eda tener una tienda para la venta de estos productos. Rosa viene trabajando con MFP, desde hace 6 a\u00f1os, este es su catorceavo cr\u00e9dito, y durante esta temporada ha visto progresar a su grupo, pues tratan de organizarse adecuadamente para evitar circunstancias dif\u00edciles. Los 1500 soles que solicita los usar\u00e1 en la compra de productos para las fechas festivas que se aproximan, como el d\u00eda de las madres.","en":"For Rosa, the well-being of her loved ones is the most important thing, and so in her home they try to always remain supportive of one another.  This is an example she wants to leave her children for when they form their own homes.  Ever since she was a young girl, she has liked to care for her appearance and use makeup, and due to the high cost of buying cosmetics, she decided to become a cosmetics salesperson in her area.  For the past 7 years she has gained experience in this activity.  Rosa's secret is to visit many people and go out every day to offer them the newest products by means of catalogs, and then deliver the products by the deadline in order to keep her clients happy.   Now she has the ambition to be a business woman, since the beauty products business encourages the women to not only be product promoters, but to look for a team they can lead and equip in sales, but without neglecting their own customers' orders.  For this reason she would like to have a store to sell these products.  Rosa has been working with MFP for 6 years, this is her fourteenth loan, and during this period she has seen her group progress, since they try to organize themselves in order to avoid difficult circumstances.  She will use the 1,500 soles she is requesting to buy products for the approaching holidays, like Mothers' Day.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":318329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-14T14:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":226.2},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":232.14},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":242.94},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":255.47},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":266.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":277.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.03},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.41},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":226.2,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":236.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596238},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":232.14,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":242.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990516},{"amount":85.03,"local_amount":242.94,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":253.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211627},{"amount":89.41,"local_amount":255.47,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":266.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641148},{"amount":93.15,"local_amount":266.13,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":278.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080588},{"amount":96.99,"local_amount":277.12,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":289.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996713}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T11:14:06Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":111945,"name":"Nicolaza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nicolaza es socia D.

O. lives in the village of Brgy. Pandan, Pontevedra, Negros Occidental. She is 66 years old, but still very determined to improve her business even though she now is a widow. She has five children who help her in running the business. Most of her children have their own family, yet still help her. Her dream is to continue her business to become more progressive and continue to borrow from NWTF-Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\nIn business for over 46 years, Evelyntina proves her skills in business management because she has remained engaged in business for such a long time. She is very thankful for her business because it contributes a lot in fulfilling her dreams in life. While in business, one may encounter problems, but these also were overcome and as a result helped to make Evelyntina strong. In 2001, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon for the purpose of expanding her business and to have access to capital. She expanded her business by adding a pig fattening business as an additional source of income. In every month she was able to earn Php 8,000. This amount was used to defray household expenses, and build savings. She maintains her good credit performance because of the continuing income of her business.\r\n\r\nPreviously she borrowed Php 19,500 for her general store and pig fattening. The said loan was fully paid on time. Now she is borrowing the same amount of Php 19,500 as additional capital for her 18th loan cycle. The income from this loan will be used for the expansion of her business and support the daily family expenses.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":417335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Additional Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Valladolid, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:01:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evelyntina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":780}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":136,"local_amount":6240,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6487.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848995},{"amount":85,"local_amount":3900,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4054.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739663},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3243.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129083},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3243.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965880},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3243.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997794}],"funded_date":"2009-11-06T03:00:14Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shali"}},{"id":153068,"name":"Kunthy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Kunthy S. lives in Andoung Samretth village in Takeo province.

She plans to use this loan to invest in her business where she sells silver jewelry, other accessories and womens shoes. She will use the profits to buy some school supplies, to eat better and expand her business to other communities in other products. In the meantime she plans to continue enjoying cooking for her family and doing her housework. She is excited to have this loan because she wants to invest more, get low interest and save money for the future.\r\n\r\nFelicia's story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in in San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and sugar cane industries, the main economic activity is a free trading zone, a cement factory, and others. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and unreliable
