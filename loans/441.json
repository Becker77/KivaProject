She lacks the funds to increase her cereal business, so she is seeking a loan of 65,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy cereals for resale. Being from a marginalized community, she finds that accessing funds is very challenging. However, through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy cereal. With the loan, she will be able to provide more cereals to the local market. This will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her cereal business to other markets. This will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income will be used in fully repaying the loan, permanently changing her living conditions, and securing the future of her school-going children.\nThis smallholder farmer is looking for a

She was born in Boane and, lived in the district of Namaacha and, when she was fleeing the war, she also lived in the city of Maputo, completing the 6th and 7th grade there. She lives with her aunt while her home is under construction. \r\nFatima has been working as a care-giver for the past two years and she has a renewable and pre-determined labor contract. Her daily shift is from 8:00am to 3:30pm. Fatima learned this skill at ADDP (African Disability Decade Programme). Her monthly salary is 4000,00mt and she is able to save 1000,00mt from that.\r\nThis is Fatima's second loan request from Hluvuku -- she has never requested it from another instituition. With this loan Fatima will buy construction materials to speed up the conclusion of her home. The house would take much longer to be completed if her salary alone had to sponsor it.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her relatives\u2019 home, and has the desire to excel in life. Although she is still very young, she realizes that she needs to work hard in order to have a better future, which is why she has been earning a living ever since she was a child. She now works in her aunt\u2019s pharmacy, where she attends to the customers very early in the morning, selling them the medication they request. They offer affordable prices, which is why theirs is the most frequented pharmacy. Yessenia is a natural saleswoman. Her joy and the trust that she gains from her customers are her main tools of persuasion. However, what she does not like is having to stay in the pharmacy all day long without being able to go out. Still, she knows that she has to work in order to make the money with which she will be able to start her own business in the future.

All of the members are accomplished, and they are united among themselves.  They hold their meetings in Ruth Montegro\u2019s house.  She has been the president for two cycles.  Most of the members prepare and sell food, make bread, or sell cosmetics.  One member of the group is a man who, in addition to selling food, also manages sound and animation equipment.\r\n\r\nRuth Montegro is one of the founders of the communal bank.  She is married and has a daughter who goes to school.  She lives in a rented house with her husband who works in urban transportation.  She is president of the communal bank.  She sells empanadas, and, most of all, she sells ordered lunches to businesses and construction workers.  She now feels satisfied with the economic support she brings to her household.  She feels important, and she also saves and shares with her friends and neighbors who are part of the bank.\r\n\r\nCandelaria V. is a very responsible member who always arrives before the others and is the last to leave.  She makes bread in her house where she lives with her family.  Her daughters help her make the dough and bake the bread.  Soon, she would like to buy a larger oven and be able to set up her own store in her home.  She wants to do this to improve her earnings.  She knows that she is not very far from her goal because in her communal bank she has learned how to save money, be responsible, and to reach her objectives.\r\n\r\nAndres S. is a long-time member.  He has been with the group for three cycles.  He is an accomplished and responsible person.  He sells food with his wife.  On the week ends he works with his amplification equipment.  He uses the equipment when he is contracted to work on the week ends at parties.  He is proud to be part of a group of women who support each other and are accomplished.  In addition to be responsible with his own family, he helps his sister  raise his two nephews.  He works hard and is very happy to belong to this communal bank. \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

He is 49 years old, and his goal is to be able to support his children in their studies.

Over time he has built up a good clientele that recommends him to others, and he is the only one in the sector of the neighborhood Laureles Sur with this business, which is a great advantage.

City, Misamis Occidental.  Lolita is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Lolita Friolo\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nLolita is blessed with 6 children of whom three are already married while the other three are now teenagers and presently working in different companies.  To earn their living, Lolita decided to engage in operating a sari-sari (variety) store. Also she is receiving support from her husband Segundino who is a farmer. For 3 years already, she was able to maintain her business  activities and at this time she is earning an average net income of not less than Php1,500 a month which is helpful to their family budget.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the good news of PAGLAUM MPC being one of the most outstanding cooperatives in Northern Mindanao and awarded Most Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines during the search for COOP-LGU Partnership Award 2006, she joined the cooperative this year, 2010. As a newly recognized member of the PDP-LP Program of PAGLAUM MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she is requesting the amount of Php 4,000 as her 1st loan to be used as additional capital for her existing sari-sari store. The future income from this loan will be used to improve living conditions for her family, to meet their basic needs, for loan repayments to PMPC, savings and for possible business expansion.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":566658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Oriental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  a general store, raising hogs and a dry goods business. Her husband, Jesus, who is 55 years old, works as a security guard to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 24 and 29 years old.\r\n\r\nAgnes joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Agnes has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $275, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use purchase more stock for the general store and dry goods businesses so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and to purchase additional pigs to raise. \r\n\r\nAgnes C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

E. is from the village of Sibutad. She is 31 years old, married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Mila owns and operates a food stall. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling viand (cooked meats) and other delicacies in the local community. Mila has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mila joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 650 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used for personal purposes. Mila is requesting her 4th loan of 14,900 PHP, which will be used to invest for the expansion of her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She moved to her current village 8 years ago, and now lives with her husband Laurent and one of their two children, both of whom have been to school.  For the past 25 years Philom\u00e8ne has run a stall selling corn in the village.

There were three other young women working at the  bakery. \r\n\r\n<p> Parvina worked at the bakery  from 2002 to 2005.

She would like to use any remaining funds  to buy fire wood to fry the pirozhki because in winter the market does not have any electricity during the day.

He started it 3 years ago after the mechanic\\'s shop where he worked closed down, when he found himself needing his own way to support his family. \r\n\r\nThanks to his business, Furkat has been able to help his family. Today he requests a loan in the amount of $2600 USD. He needs you and through your generosity you can help him expand his business so that he may continue to support his children's education.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 39 years old. Belinda is married and has three school-aged children. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Belinda raises livestock, primarily pigs, for fattening and sale. Belinda has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Belinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Belinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. \r\n\r\nBelinda is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Belinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her specialty is seafood and is in high demand from tourists who come to this beautiful place.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy rice, meat, fish and other ingredients for food preparation, ahead of the carnival season which will hopefully be very profitable.

Carolyne and two other promoters in her community, including Tom and Eunice, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Carolyne will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Carolyne wants to be a promoter because she believes that the dispenser will kill bacteria, making the water safe to drink.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

She opened her restaurant in 1994 with the fund that she received that year. Now her restaurant is a familiar address to the locals. At first, only breakfast was served. As the popularity of the restaurant grows so do the operating hours. Now it is open from morning till night. The restaurant's menu offers more choices than ever: poultry, pork, pork's tripes ...etc. It also offers a catering service. In 2005, Ms Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng expanded her restaurant  from 50 square meters to over 200 square meters (1800 square feet). Her husband,  Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng, and their 2 daughters give her  a hand in running the restaurant. The monthly revenue from the restaurant is 200-300 USD.

It was founded in 1996 by a Lebanese called Rashik. It was primarily established for the propagation of the Shiite Islamic faith. Today, it has a total of 722 pupils, with a staff of 18 teachers. <P>\r\n\r\nAlhadi is proud that their pupils are able to make good grades on the National Primary School Exams (NPSE). In sports also, (i.e., for both athletics and soccer), Alhadi is proud that they always emerge victorious among all Islamic schools in Makeni town. <P>\r\n\r\nOver the years the school has grown so much that it now lacks adequate furniture and teaching materials. There are not enough benches and desks for the pupils, so they have to squeeze together. In addition to this, teaching materials like textbooks and chalk are also a constrain for this school.<P>\r\n\r\nThis will be the first loan for teachers of the Alhadi Primary School from SMT (through Kiva). This loan will certainly be of immense help to these teachers. Since salaries are usually small in Sierra Leone, and especially so for people in the teaching profession, they can not use such salaries to buy much or do anything great. But with a loan, they can now buy or do something big and then repay over a period of time. Some of them will use their share to begin or continue building a house, others to pay either for themselves to pursue further studies or pay for their children\u2019s education. Some will use their share to invest in business in order to complement their monthly salaries. And still others will use theirs to buy pieces of furniture.<P>\r\n\r\nFatu M. K. (left) is the head teacher of this school. She was born in Lunsar, Port Loko district, northern Sierra Leone. She is age fifty-five and a widow of four children. All of her children are now grown-ups and are professionals. She has been head teacher of this school for five years now. Fatu will use her Le 1,000,000 loan to invest in business. She will make \"gara lappers\" (locally dyed cloth, sometimes with fancy designs) to sell in Freetown. Fatu said she wants to get started in business so that once she retires, she will have something to do. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4475,"image":{"id":255330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Invest in her start-up business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T20:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4475,"lender_count":141,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatu M.

A. is a woman of 26 years married to Yinier Gustavo Araya. They have a daughter whose name is Enid Sofia. They live in a small community west of San Jose called Grifo Alto Puriscal. Grifo Alto is a rural community that is approximately one hour west of San Jos\u00e9. It is a mountainous area and has a beautiful view of valleys, rivers, and mountains that overlook the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Grifo Alto is on the road towards the beaches so many tourists stop there to eat or simply enjoy the scenery and the rural environment. \r\n\r\nThe area has many small farms for agriculture and livestock. They used to plant a lot of tobacco, but then prices dropped and people sought other options. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda de los Angeles has a farm of laying hens for eggs which are sold in the community. They started this business two years ago when Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles' father sold them a piece of land where they built a shed and started with 300 chicks. With the first micro loan they requested they were able to increase the number of hens to 750. Now they plan to obtain a new loan in order to get to 1000 hens and in the future increase to 1500 which is the target they have been proposed and which they think will provide a sufficient income to become the source of income for the whole family. \r\n\r\nWith the loan they are requesting they plan to buy 250 chicks, 20 bags of feed, 10 feeders, and 10 waterers. At this time Mar\u00eda de los Angeles works taking care of the chickens, feeding them, collecting the eggs, and distributing the eggs in nearby shops and houses. Her husband helps in the evenings after returning from his work. Maria de los Angeles is a member of the Community Credit Corporation of Grifo Alto Puriscal which is one of the community social organizations of EDESA. Previously she obtained a loan of six hundred thousand colones (\u00a2 600,000) which she repaid in a timely manner now that the business generates daily income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She will use this loan to pay for labor to clear her farmland, tools for farming, groundnuts (peanuts) and seedlings for the crops.  By hiring additional labor to work her farm, Hanna is creating employment opportunities for her neighbors in the community.  \r\n\r\nSimilar to fellow borrowers at GHAPE, a field partner of Kiva, Hanna and her family have faced some of life's challenges, such as deep poverty, sickness, and inability to pay for education. However, with the profit from her loan, she will be able to help herself and her family live a better life, pay for her children's education and support other family members.  \r\n\r\nHanna believes that her business will do well because of her hard work, and she is appreciative of Kiva's field partner, GHAPE, because she would not be able to expand her farm otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account, and most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":299746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Labor to Clear Farmland, Peanuts, Seedlings and Farming Tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Bailem, Belo, N.W.

They trusted her and this motivated her to be responsible in her repayments.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Westin, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":338685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"She will buy different clothing for women and men","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-06-22T01:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Danilza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":301.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52985554},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":301.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205974},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":301.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635225},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":301.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074291}],"funded_date":"2009-06-22T04:05:21Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T22:48:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Westin","image":54967}},{"id":120573,"name":"Bopha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Bopha N., 31, and her husband, Mr. Phalla Lun, 27, live along National Road Number One about fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh City.

She has one child and a second child who is due any day.  She lives in the town of Picoy in her own house, one-half hour from the city of Tarma.  Despite her pregnancy, she cultivates and harvests her crops and also tends to her cows daily and sells the milk in the city market.  The majority of her income is derived from the cultivation of vegetables; therefore, she does not fail to cultivate and water her seedlings, and, as a result, harvests in only three months the expected produce, such as carrots.  When she harvests her produce, she also sorts it by size and washes it in the irrigation ditch of her town, so that later, generally on Tuesdays at three in the afternoon, she takes it to the most important market in the city of Tarma, where it is chosen by the buyers who pay the best prices.  For this reason, Rosmery likes to sow all types of vegetables which permit her to profit in a short period of time.\r\nThis is her thirteenth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she has never been late in making payments on her previous loans.  In addition, when it is her turn to host her group in her house, she prepares the traditional spicy meat stew to share with her companions in the cooperative bank, who she holds in high esteem.  With the requested $350, she will buy chemical fertilizers and carrot seeds to increase production.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeff Schell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":378447,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fertilizers and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-27T19:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":152.7},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":158.1},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":163.68},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":169.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.43},{"due_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":180.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.31},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.4},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.45,"local_amount":152.7,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":158.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081254},{"amount":55.33,"local_amount":158.1,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":163.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997404},{"amount":57.29,"local_amount":163.68,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":169.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842749},{"amount":183.93,"local_amount":525.52,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":544.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734330}],"funded_date":"2009-08-27T20:22:37Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Schell","image":null}},{"id":137007,"name":"Teresia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\nTeresia is a member of the Idope west in Kinayanambo, Iringa.

cuando posteriormente los clientes aumentaron sus pedidos de mercanc\u00eda, ten\u00edan que esperar hasta recoger sus cuentas por cobrar para responderles, as\u00ed muchas veces dejaron de ser oportunos y por eso recurrieron a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo buscando recursos para financiarse.  Hoy su esposo trabaja de mensajero  en una empresa, pero tambi\u00e9n gestiona la venta de mercanc\u00eda que Karen vende entre sus compa\u00f1eros de trabajo, ayud\u00e1ndola  a conseguir mucha clientela de sus conocidos.  Karen ha recibido 2 cr\u00e9ditos de la Fundaci\u00f3n en la l\u00ednea de capital de trabajo, con ellos ha podido aumentar sus utilidades porque tiene m\u00e1s venta debido a que con este dinero pudo comprar m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda y hacer una oferta  diversificada; en la actualidad  solicita su tercer cr\u00e9dito por valor de $ 2.200.000 para comprar ropa, calzado e interiores para damas caballeros y ni\u00f1os, tendidos para camas, para lo cual viajar\u00e1 a  Barranquilla, ciudad a dos horas de Cartagena, porque incluyendo transporte su mercanc\u00eda  sale a un mejor costo y puede venderla a un precio adecuado entre sus clientes.\nCon su  negocio Karen se siente \u00fatil para los planes futuros que tienen ella y su esposo, porque sabe que pude lograr el sue\u00f1o de adquirir su vivienda propia y  piensa que puede tambi\u00e9n tener un local al lado de su casa. Su gran desaf\u00edo es terminar los estudios  y con su esposo tener un  gran almac\u00e9n de ropa y brindar a los hijos que planean,  un futuro prometedor.\nKaren se siente contenta, vive en un barrio que fue producto de invasi\u00f3n pero entre todos los vecinos  se organizaron y lograron  acceder a todos los servicios p\u00fablicos y especialmente a la pavimentaci\u00f3n de sus calles que hace f\u00e1cil el acceso a su negocio.\n\n","en":"Karen Bar\u00f3n B., age 26, lives in the Altos de San Isidro neighborhood of the city of Cartagena de Indias, within the municipality of Bol\u00edvar.  She began her business with a small amount of capital that she obtained from temporary work during school vacations.  She also paid high school fees with her earnings because, beginning when she was very young, she did business with her classmates.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen she married her husband (standing next to her in the photo) he sent friends from his job to her as customers.  Once, when he became unemployed, he began working with her for a year, and the couple continued to produce profits.  They were selling from door-to-door and neighborhood-to-neighborhood, and they say they got to know and win over many customers.\r\n<p>\r\nLater, when customers increased their orders for merchandise they had to wait until they had collected on their accounts in order to fill them.  As a result, many times they lost opportunities.  Because of this, they resorted to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, looking for resources to finance themselves.  Today, her husband works as a messenger in a business, but he also tries to sell Karen's merchandise to his fellow employees, helping her to get more business from among his acquaintances.\r\n<p>\r\nKaren has received two loans from Fundaci\u00f3n for working capital.  With these she was able to increase her earnings because she had more sales due to the fact that she was able to buy more merchandise and offer greater diversity.  Currently, she is applying for her third loan for 2,200,000 Columbian pesos in order to purchase clothing, footwear, and underwear for ladies, gentlemen and children.  For these she will travel to Barranquilla, a city two hours from Cartagena, because, even including transportation, she can obtain her merchandise at a better price there and can sell it at a good price to her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her business Karen feels good about the future plans that she and her husband have because she knows that they can succeed in their dream of acquiring their own home, and she thinks that she can also have a shop next to their house.  Her great challenge is to finish her schooling and with her husband have a large clothing store and offer the children they plan to have a promising future.\r\n<p>\r\nKaren feels contented.  She lives in a neighborhood that was informally settled but all the neighbors organized themselves and succeeded in obtaining public services and especially the paving of their streets, which makes access to her business easy.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva

She owns a business venture, raising fish for sale.  Tina  has many years of experience in this business.  Tina  needs a loan of WST $1500 purchase fishing gears and a new canoe.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 750 talas or US $313 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tina  joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tina 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tina  P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Her loan from ASHI is her main source of financial support. The profit from her business provides her family with food and other basic needs because this  is the only income source for both her and her husband. \r\n\r\nSince she started receiving loans from ASHI in 2004, her business has grown and she has been able to support the needs of her four children, particularly their educational needs. Soon, her eldest will go to college and her second child is in secondary school. They will need much financial support until they graduate from college. Therefore, Rowena really wants her business to become stable and to increase the family income while her two youngest children are still in elementary school. She is requesting a much larger loan from ASHI to help finance her aspirations for the business. \r\n\r\nWith hope that, someday, she will fully achieve her dream of lifting her family above poverty, Rowena is very enthusiastic about managing her business well, in partnership with her loving husband.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":519689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is 35 years old. Marlon is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarlon is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Marlon owns & operates a business venture in the manufacturing sector operating a furniture making business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from making & selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members. Marlon has been engaged in his business for over 1 year and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marlon joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marlon is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Marlon from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is a married woman who lives in Daan bantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: tailoring and a general store.  Her husband, Pablito, who is 49 years old, works as a tailor to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 5 children who are between 11 to 21 years old. Enrequita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Enrequita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000.  She intends to use it to buy materials for the sewing machine so that she can continue to save up for her children's education and the improvement of her home & store. Enrequita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This is Shamim M., a 39-year-old woman from Mwanza. She is a widow with four children, who are between the ages of 14 and 20 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nShamim M. has been operating a charcoal sales business since 1998. Notably, many Tanzanians use charcoal for fuel to cook their daily meals; indeed, women cook food in small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags, or kerosene in order to light the charcoal. Fortunately, there is a high demand for charcoal across the country, so charcoal-selling is quite a lucrative profession. She works at her business 16 hours per day, 7 days per week, though she notes that she receives assistance from one employee. In doing so, Shamim currently earns approximately $440 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to purchase more charcoal for resale purposes. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Shamim thanks you for her support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

the past two years.  It's extremely exhausting work and the pay is not great, but it meets her family's needs.  She is 46-years-old and lives in Villa Reconciliaci\u00f3n in the city of Managua.  In the past she had worked for herself as a street vendor selling pork products, but in the end she could not sell as much as she needed to so she closed the business.  He husband is a truck driver, which does not pay enough to cover their expenses, so they both have to work. \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan they are seeking from AFODENIC. The loans, which they've been using to finish their house and do home improvements, have been very beneficial to them.  They plan to use this loan to buy a toilet and the materials to install it, so the family can have a decent bathroom and enjoy better hygiene.   Their future plans include starting their own business, and having the means to help their children obtain a better education.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":255407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy a toilet and the matierials to install it.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":19.81,"local_amount":339.63,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":395.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351574},{"amount":19.47,"local_amount":333.8,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":389.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038911},{"amount":19.04,"local_amount":326.56,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":380.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929207},{"amount":20.93,"local_amount":358.79,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":418.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384119},{"amount":17.96,"local_amount":307.87,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":358.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890581},{"amount":21.5,"local_amount":368.61,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:39:09Z","rounded_local_amount":429.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111880},{"amount":17.37,"local_amount":298.05,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":347.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533295},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":388.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964673},{"amount":19.48,"local_amount":333.36,"processed_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":388.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875141}],"funded_date":"2009-02-01T18:46:39Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T10:41:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":87821,"name":"Noemi Marcelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Noem\u00ed es madre de cuatro hijos, dos de ellos aun viven con ella y con su esposo.

She lives in the house that her parents left her, and she has a drive to move ahead and giver her son a good education. She believes education is a very important aspect in the life of a child, and for this reason she decided to start a school for special children (with Down's Syndrome or mental retardation), as she feels that we all deserve the opportunity to have a good education. She is very happy and carefully tends to her \"Loves\", as she calls the children who study in her Educational Institution. She really enjoys her work, and is very happy teaching children. She has been working in this field for seven years, and the most difficult part is taking care of her students during unforeseen circumstances.

She is 52 years old with two children: Melquiades, age 19, and a daughter, age 25.  Irma is engaged in the making and selling of tortillas every day, and in the afternoons she makes small snacks that people in El Salvador cannot do without.  \r\n<p>\r\nIrma has a very stable clientele since she has been working for years and is well known in the area.  The loan that Irma is applying for is for the purchase of basic materials since she wants to increase her production and offer them in more places in order to succeed in obtaining greater

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She has been doing this for 16 years and finds the most difficult thing about it is transporting her goods to the various city markets.  In the future, she would like to have a store where she could sell her merchandise with greater ease and she\u2019s willing to work hard to achieve this.  \r\n\r\nThis is Jacinta\u2019s sixth loan with MFP, she knows she has to pay her installments on time and she promises to do so.  She is well loved and respected in her communal bank since she always keeps the meetings running smoothly.

She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Faima  has many years of experience in this business.  Faima  needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Faima  joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faima 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faima  F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She hopes to further improve her fishing business through hard work and with continuous support from ASHI and the Kiva Partner.\n\nDue to a lack of business capital, she was encouraged to seek financial support from Kiva lenders.

Her hard work and patience are her foundation to achieve a better life. \n\nThe income she earns from the business is very helpful, as it supports her business and sustains the needs of her family, especially by providing school allowances for her only son, Romeo, a high school student. She hopes that someday she will be able to expand her fishing business. Rosalie is glad to have the secure opportunity to request this loan and for your support and encouragement. \n\nHer long-term goal is to have a fish farm so that she can offer support to others in her village, especially her relatives.

The income that they earn from this business really helps her to sustain their basic needs. Though some of her children who already work help support her, sometimes it is not enough for their needs, especially if there are unexpected expenses.\r\n\r\nNally is one of the pioneer members of the branch. She has been a member for 11 years in ASHI and has already received several awards for being a good member. The Institution really helps her because through ASHI, some of her children have already finished their studies and have a stable job, and she has a tricycle.\r\n\r\nFor her next loan, she is planning to expand her store and to purchase again an additional motorcycle. These projects are very useful not only for her, but also to her children who do not have any source of income.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream in life is to have a decent house and to have savings for the

The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling seafood products  including fish, milkfish, and sardines  in the local community. Emerita has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 10,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Emerita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business. Emerita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. \r\n\r\nEmerita is requesting a new loan of 14,000 Philippines pesos, which will be used to purchase additional products, like milkfish and mackerel, to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Emerita from HSPFI.

At this time, she is working hard to continue to provide income for her children's everyday expenses as well as their schooling. Marcela believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMarcela operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat home-cooked meals only during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. \r\n\r\nHer regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Aside from the food stall, she sells frozen food like hot dogs and ham. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,690 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, as well as frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarcela dreams of giving all her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her own restaurant. \r\n\r\nShe faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She gets good earnings from this business.  In addition, she has a stall for selling beauty products to customers that already know her.\r\n<p>\r\nHer businesses are doing well. \u201cI sold a lot of meat during the festivals,\u201d she says.  That\u2019s why she plans on opening a \u201cchicharroner\u00eda\u201d (a restaurant where pork dishes are sold).  She lacks very little in order to achieve this goal.\r\n<p>\r\nEstrella belongs to the IDME communal bank, and this is her twenty-fourth loan with MFP.

In addition, she is thankful to be part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible and supportive.  Upon receiving her loan, Estrella will invest the money applied for in renting her new restaurant, as well as in purchasing dishes and other utensils needed for selling meals.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":912134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to rent a place for her restaurant and purchase dishes and utensils.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-07T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estrella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":345.99},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":373.16},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":379.65},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":401.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.63},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":132.63,"local_amount":345.99,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":359.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621958},{"amount":143.04,"local_amount":373.16,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":387.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836032},{"amount":145.54,"local_amount":379.65,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":393.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245792},{"amount":153.79,"local_amount":401.2,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:37Z","rounded_local_amount":416.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385825}],"funded_date":"2011-11-15T19:25:21Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rick & Pat Brown","image":null}},{"id":359138,"name":"Miriam Yanina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mirian tiene un Bodega, el pr\u00e9stamo que solicita lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de arroz, az\u00facar y fideos al por mayor.

Chincha is named after the Chincha culture, famous for its advanced agricultural innovation and its heroic deeds at sea.  Today Chincha is an incredible mix of cultures, with a large Afro-Peruvian population, resulting from what is left of an indigenous past and the influences of the Spanish empire.  The city, along with other cities near the Pacific coast, was damaged in 2001 and 2007, years in which strong earthquakes occurred, but has continued on as it always has through its history.  \r\n\r\nRoric lives with his mother and at 23 years old he has his own business selling Salchipollo (a food consisting of french fries and pieces of fried chicken which is accompanied by various sauces).  Three years ago he got up the courage to have this type of business thanks to his mother since he has helped in her food stand, and after much effort and dedication he was able to save enough money to form his own business.  Roric, in spite of the difficult nature of his work and his young age, has his own cooking utensils and his own salchipollo cart, from which he sells his products outside of the rural bank \"Se\u00f1or de Luren\".  It is there that he can be contacted, since there are always people wanting to buy his food because they it is so delicious.  He is not timid and always shows kindness to his customers, as he is of the opinion that that kindness and the care with which he prepares his products causes him to have such a good clientele.  \r\n\r\nRoric is very grateful to those who give Kiva loans because thanks to their help he will be able to purchase more supplies and cooking utensils to make his business better and in turn better his quality of life.

He usually takes orders from his clients before he buy the items. He said that he has been in this business for more than five years. He is ambitious about becoming a big wholesaler in his area one day. He is in need of USD 550 to replenish his stock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":48709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"To purchase different consumables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":10,"posted_date":"2007-07-13T17:09:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Twaha","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-07-27T22:36:35Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T09:15:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-29T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47278},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-09-28T09:15:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-29T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59652},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-10-28T10:15:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-29T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73023},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-11-28T10:15:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-29T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87854},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-12-28T10:16:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-29T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103930},{"amount":90,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2008-01-28T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-29T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123079}],"funded_date":"2007-07-13T22:36:35Z","paid_date":"2008-01-28T10:16:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":18181,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"LAPO has given me voice,\" says Mrs. Rose O. whose business is stable and profitable.

Thi Bao, 35 years old, has 3 school-going children. Before joining the TYM Fund, she stayed at home to raise livestock and take care of the children, thus her family relied mainly on her husband's income. Therefore, they faced many difficulties. She joined the Fund in 1995 and borrowed loans to start a business. She used the first few loans to get used to doing business by selling fresh bamboo shoot. After 10 years of membership, she now has a small shop selling foodstuffs in the market. Besides managing the shop, she also works for various local processed-meat production companies so her family's income is very stable. Her husband works as a driver, earning 3,000,000VND (about 193USD) per month. Her children can all go to school. This time, she would like to borrow 19,000,000VND (1,150USD) to invest in her food shop. Her family's monthly income is 7,000,000VND (about 451USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb V\u0169 Th\u1ecb B\u1ea3o n\u0103m nay 35 tu\u1ed5i.

This is Frida M., a 26-year-old woman from Mwanza. She is married and has two children, who are both 3 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nFrida M. has been running a stationary business since 2006. The stationary sales business allows micro-entrepreneurs to demonstrate their business savvy; to illustrate, most such entrepreneurs place their shops, stalls, or tables strategically close to post offices, banks, schools, and universities in order to generate as much income as possible. She works at her business 12 hours per day and 6 days per week. By doing so, Frida is able to earn approximately $300 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to buy a printer and additional paper to better meet her customers' demands. In the future, she plans to increase her inventory of stationary. Frida thanks you for your support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Secretarial Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To meet customer demand by purchasing a printer and additional paper","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T19:00:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436337},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130609},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:23Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027406},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613407},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010487},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232786},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664602},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105333},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022478},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867728}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T19:39:20Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Craig Kaufman","image":null}},{"id":83741,"name":"Ana Isabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana is a member of the Las Entusiastas (\u201cThe Enthusiasts\u201d) Village Bank.

Hakik is a dynamic and ambitious 50-year-old woman. She is married and has three children.\r\n\r\nFor three years, Hakik has had a small business processing and drying apricots. Thanks to the quality of her products and the experience she gained in this sphere of business, she has earned a solid reputation among her customers. Accordingly, the demand for her goods has grown, allowing her to contribute significantly to the household.\r\n\r\nNow, Hakik requests 900 USD to spend on purchasing apricots which she will dry and resell. She hopes that she will continue sending her children to school so that they will be able to get an adequate education. She expresses her gratitude to everyone supporting her.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Constance was born on October 22, 1978 in Niger, a country neighboring Benin.  She is married and the mother of two children who are both in school.  She lives in her father\u2019s house in Fifadji, a district of Cotonou. Constance attended school but did not finish primary school.  Sewing is what she finally learned as her trade.  Yet she worked in this trade for only a few years and finally came to devote all her time to commerce.  She used to sell food in front of her house.  But today, it\u2019s grains, corn in particular.  Constance has already had three different ALID\u00e9 business loans.  She\u2019s requesting this fourth loan for bolstering her working capital and for growing her business in grains.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":388574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy four 100-kg sacks of corn ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-09-16T00:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Constance","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":14285.71},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":14285.71},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":14285.71},{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":14285.71},{"due_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":14285.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":14285.71},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":14285.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.14},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.14},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.14},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":14285.71,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":14428.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96896197},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":14285.71,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":14428.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735777},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":14285.71,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":14428.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623288},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":14285.71,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":14428.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019993},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":14285.71,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":14428.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858486},{"amount":32.16,"local_amount":14285.71,"processed_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":14428.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136618638},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":14285.74,"processed_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":14428.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144652699}],"funded_date":"2009-09-16T01:22:32Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":141150,"name":"Mrs. Vorn Sok Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group loan consists of six people who all live in Smaong Village in Takeo province.

The three children are currently studying so creating more expenses, especially her two older children who are in college. Rosario helps Eugenio in providing for their family through the income from buying and selling various frozen foods. Sometimes she sells some beauty products, and also offers her customers pedicures or manicures, treatment for their hair, a spa for their feet, and facial treatments.<P>\r\n\r\nHer 7th loan from Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) is will be used in buying what is needed for these businesses: frozen foods and  beauty products and for her other business, nail polish, things used in treating hair, face, and feet. She is sure after buying all this, she will get a big boost in income because these are all the things that help her in improving her businesses.<P>\r\n\r\nThe education of her children is her priority in life, so she will do everything to make her businesses grow.

Her greatest desire is to improve their quality of life.  She sells papayas in the Las Mercedes (Juliaca's most important market) market.  Her husband brings the papayas from the city of Puerto Maldonado (a city on the Brazilian border).  Her stand is very popular because her papayas are fresh and juicy and this has attracted many customers.  What Luz most likes about her job is being able to chat with her fellow merchants because that makes the long work days much more pleasant.  She has been in this line of work for 8 years and considers the most difficult part of it having to stay at her post all day long not being able to go out anywhere.  She hopes that, in time, her business will grow and produce better earnings.  This is Luz's 9th loan with MFP.  She knows that she must make all her repayments on time if she wants to have access to future loans and she is willing to do so.  The 2000 soles requested will be used to buy more papayas in order to have better selection of merchandise.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":436736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase stock inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":137.19},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":141.99},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":146.96},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.24},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":159.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":162.93},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":166.02},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":176.65},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":188.26},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":193.01},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":198.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.02},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.02},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.89},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":97.71,"local_amount":279.18,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":281.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734872},{"amount":51.44,"local_amount":146.96,"processed_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":148.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124196},{"amount":52.58,"local_amount":150.24,"processed_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":151.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992781},{"amount":55.67,"local_amount":159.04,"processed_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":160.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992782},{"amount":57.02,"local_amount":162.93,"processed_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:00Z","rounded_local_amount":164.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717571},{"amount":58.11,"local_amount":166.02,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":167.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751246},{"amount":61.83,"local_amount":176.65,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":178.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933796},{"amount":62.59,"local_amount":178.83,"processed_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":180.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672698},{"amount":65.89,"local_amount":188.26,"processed_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":189.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886595},{"amount":137.16,"local_amount":391.89,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153755}],"funded_date":"2009-12-09T00:58:54Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":161818,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is fifty-one years old.

Cruz, Brgy. Don Virgilio, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating one business venture: a fishing \/ fish vending business.  Her husband Vicente B., who is 50 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have nine children who are 4 to 19 years old.  One of their children has their own family. Another one works and the other seven are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nJudy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Judy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,900, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use to buy fishnet so that she can continue to save up for the future and the business. \r\n\r\nJudy B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n About NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in her own house with her husband Severo, 40, and their 3 children, in the village of Picoy.  Early every morning, Yanet goes out to work in her fields, since she knows that the prices she gets for the vegetables she grows (such as potatoes and peas) depend on the quality of her products.  She sells her products at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma, where she can get the best price for them. She loves cultivating her land and has been doing it with her husband for 25 years.  The hardest part is transporting the products to market.  Over time, she would like buy more land so as to increase her production.  She has also begun selling clothing and accessories made from recyclable materials, such as bottles, boxes, popsicle sticks, and so on.  She sells these at a stall in the indoor market in Tarma. She is also planning to start making ceramics this month, and she is sure to succeed, thanks to her good character and her innate creativity.  \r\n\r\nYanet counts on your support to continue her work.

Georgina has been in this business for five years.\r\n<p>\r\nShe works Monday through Sunday from home but also at the open fairs.  Georgina has many customers.  Her merchandise is purchased in the city of Santiago and then shipped.  She deposits the money and the merchandise (bundles of used clothing) is shipped to the bus terminal in the city of Talca.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan she will buy accessories and toys, products that she will sell exclusively for the Christmas season.  In addition, she will buy a cooler so that she can sell ice cream treats and beverages during the summer at the fair.  Her goals include buying a truck so that she can transport her merchandise.  She currently uses a tricycle, but sometimes she will rent a vehicle, which requires sacrifice and cost.\r\n<p>\r\nGeorgina lives with her husband and two children, age 9 and 6.  Her dreams on a personal level include establishing a store in her house, which would allow her to spend more time at home to look after her children.  Another goal is to prosper her business so that she can provide a better quality of life for her family and pay for her children\u2019s higher education.  \r\n<p>\r\nGeorgina is very grateful for the support Fondo Esperanza has provided.  She says that she would not have a business without it because the assistance she received enabled her to invest in merchandise.  Her Communal Bank group is very close and responsible.

Some say that the phrase was originally attributed to an Englishman who said, \u201cTalca feels like London\u201d because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city during winter, just like in the United Kingdom.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":937984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy accessories and toys to sell for the Christmas season and a cooler for selling ice cream treats and beverages at the fairs.
