She is 28, single, and the mother of a 4-year-old son.  She studied through 12th grade at the Joaquim Chissano high school in Boane.  She lives in her own home in Boane with her brother.  She doesn't support anyone else besides her son.  She left Maputo for Boane in 2002 with her parents because they lived in a rented home.  She has been employed with a humanitarian organization (Kulima) for more than 2 years.  She works 8 hours a day on average.  She makes a wage of 4,300 meticais per month, and she manages to save some in a bank account through a rotating savings system called Xitique.  She has never had a loan with another banking institution.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through colleagues who are also clients of this institution.  This is her 3rd loan, and it is for 15,000 meticais, which she will use to buy construction material (stone, cement, sand, iron, etc.).  Her previous loans were for 5,000 and 10,000 meticais which she used for the same purpose.  In the future, she would like to request more loans to construct a new home, where she will spend her free time with her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This chicken coop is very large, and she is able to walk in it comfortably.  The second is for her home grown chickens and has 10 chickens and a rooster.  Her chicken coops are made from tin, planks, and chicken wire since a lot of foxes hang around where she lives.  To date the foxes haven\u2019t eaten any of her chickens.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the loan she will be able to buy more egg producing chickens in order to continue increasing her capital.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.  This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

She and her husband, Mr. Keit Chamroeun, are grocers in the local village. Aside from this business, Mr. Keit Chamroeun is a farmer who cultivates rice on a piece of land to earn a living. In this plantation, he faces an obstacle because he does not have enough money to buy rice seeds to cultivate, so Mrs. Savoeung S. decided to ask for a loan to buy rice seeds to cultivate rice. She will use the rest of the loan to buy fuel to support a pump to make her crop more productive. She is 43 years old and the mother of four children, one of whom is employed in a garment factory; the remaining three are attending the local school. Mrs. Savoeung S. did not come to take the loan, but her husband did so he is shown in the picture instead.

All of the members of the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. They will use the microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that it is imperative for the communities it works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water from the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":35863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farm rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-16T22:59:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-01T22:16:09Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":825,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:25:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21965},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:25:27Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29292},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:11:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40399},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:21:50Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65661},{"amount":561,"local_amount":561,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T22:50:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":561,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66077}],"funded_date":"2007-05-18T22:16:09Z","paid_date":"2007-10-11T22:50:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14213,"name":"Romana","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Romana is a responsible, hard-working and enthusiastic woman.

Conchita because their businesses are located in front of the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception in the State of Mexico.  The group is composed of 10 members and this is the 4th time they have solicited a loan through CrediCom\u00fan.\r\n\r\nLeydy is 22 years old, married, and has completed the 6th year of primary school.  She is married and has no children.  Leydy is dedicated to the production and sale of bread, a business she started 3 years ago.  She is soliciting a loan to buy flour, sugar, and supplies for her stall.  Her clients are from the surrounding area and she sells on market days.  Leydy also sells to people from the same locality when there is a special event.  Besides bread, she also makes pizza, which she sells whole or by the slice.\r\n   \r\nAs she solicits this loan, Leydy feels very satisfied because she has just finished repaying a loan and is contemplating investing the new loan. It has cost her much work to keep the businesses going.  Despite the current economic situation, she has managed to grow, little by little, thanks to the loan, and to her husband's help.  Leydy suffered very much upon starting production, because she was helping her parents who permitted her to use their oven.  Then after she decided to become independent, it cost her much effort to take charge of her own affairs.  She hopes that in time, and with the h Help she will receive with this loan, she will be able to increase production, because she wants to expand her business, and that this will permit her to work hard to maintain the children that she plans to have.  For the moment, she only focuses on the idea of working to make her business larger.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nCrisanta (seasonal decorations)\r\nLaura (raising animals)\r\nMaria Guadalupo (raising and selling chickens)\r\nCarolina (raising cattle)\r\nSusana (raising and selling chickens) \r\nCarmen (selling vegetables) \r\nAmalia (selling clothes) \r\nAraceli (selling vegetables), and \r\nLourdes \r\n\r\nAll of these women appear in the photo except, from shyness, Guadalupe and Carolina remain a bit hidden among their companions.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. is a 38-year-old married woman and the mother of three children, all of whom are currently in school. For a living, she trades in charcoal. Notably, charcoal is a very popular source of energy for cooking in many traditional Ghanaian homes. Due to the success of her business, she was able to support her first child through senior high school. Sheila obtains her supply of charcoal from the surrounding villages of Tema, and she then resells such charcoal to her customers for a profit. <p>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, her working capital (which was provided by her husband) is inadequate to enable her to purchase the large quantities of charcoal needed to meet her customers\u2019 demands. As a result, her sales and profit margins have been rather limited in recent months. Now, she is seeking a loan to purchase a bulk supply of charcoal in order to increase her charcoal inventory, and because she plans to start selling gari and maize to supplement her income (and thus needs capital to kickstart that line of business). She believes that the loan proceeds will enable her to increase her savings so that she can pay for her children's educational needs. <p>\r\n\r\nSheila is a member of the community group known as The Voice Trust Group. In this group, members guarantee each other's loans as social collateral (i.e., if one member does not promptly repay her portion of the loan, then the other members are responsible for curing the arrears), and they provide support for one another to repay their respective loans. She notes that she does not sell anything on days when her group meets, and that her picture was taken during her group meeting."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":229059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To meet her customers' demands by expanding her charcoal inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Tema","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.616667 -0.016667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2008-11-24T00:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sheila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":64.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55.36,"local_amount":64.29,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":65.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9972544},{"amount":55.36,"local_amount":64.29,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:21:33Z","rounded_local_amount":65.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9972545},{"amount":55.36,"local_amount":64.29,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":65.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10235704},{"amount":55.36,"local_amount":64.29,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:22:27Z","rounded_local_amount":65.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10235705},{"amount":55.36,"local_amount":64.29,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:25:55Z","rounded_local_amount":65.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10235706},{"amount":442.89,"local_amount":514.32,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":526.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44614844},{"amount":55.31,"local_amount":64.23,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":65.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53011812}],"funded_date":"2008-11-24T21:56:57Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:08:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Craig Kaufman","image":null}},{"id":79789,"name":"Jesusa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fermeldy is one of the 46 barangays of the Tumauni municipality.

married with 9 children ranging in age from 9 to 25.  She joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in August of 1998, after a friend invited her, and with the first PHP 3,000 loan she borrowed she was able to revive her barely surviving \"sari-sari\" or general store. Profits from her loans allowed her to buy appliances and furniture, and to make house repairs.\r\n\r\nSubsequent loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon allowed her to invest in ducks and she saved the profits until she was able to buy a carabao which she rented out. Today she has several bulls, one cow, and several heads of pigs, and the \"sari-sari\" or general store is also performing well.  Now Aleja wants to borrow PHP 19,500 to buy more cattle to expand her herd.  Aleja is doing all this so she can provide her children with a good education and secure their future.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":378939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She lives in a rented room with her 28 year old husband, Yony, and her one year old daughter, Amira.  She wishes to give them a better quality of life.  Her youth has not been an impediment for Drusila because she was able to open her tire store.  It is her own business, and her husband also works there.  Her business is very busy with the interprovincial vehicles because the tire shop is located very close to the bus terminal.  What she likes best about her work is that it allows her to manage her time between work and the household chores.  She has been in the business for four years.  The most difficult part is loading the heavy tires to repair them.\r\n\r\nIn the future she hopes to improve the business\u2019 facilities to be able to take care of a greater number of customers.\r\n\r\nThis is Drucila\u2019s first loan with MFP.

Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.

They request a second loan from Kiva. They have two new members. Three of the members make aprons in the homes and later sell them. They have managed to purchase their own sewing machines. This business has been successful because the aprons are widely used by the indigenous women of the country. \r\n\r\nAnother one of the members grows flowers. She requires working capital to prepare for the Day of the Dead celebrated on November first, when it is tradition to have everything decorated. \r\n\r\nThe group is represented by Mrs. Mirian Leticia C..

Camantigue, Brgy Old Sagay, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: tailoring and ready-to-wear clothes businesses. Her husband, Edgar A., who is 52 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living. They have seven children who are between the ages of 9 and 27 years old.\r\n\r\nWilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Wilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $70, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase raw materials for tailoring so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her children's education. Wilma A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Similar to a pizza, it can be sliced or folded, and it can either be served for breakfast or lunch. \r\n\r\nThe word manaqish is the plural of the Arabic word manq\u016bshah (from the root verb naqasha 'to sculpt, carve out'), meaning that after the dough has been rolled flat, it is pressed by the fingertips to create little dips for the topping to lie in. Traditionally, Arab women would bake dough in a communal oven in the morning, to provide their family with their daily bread needs. They would prepare smaller portions of dough with different toppings for breakfast at this time. \r\n\r\nAli has been a pastry baker since 2004. He makes delicious pastries that no one can resist.

It's composed of 5 members who they know well and are neighbors. The members are Margarita who will buy oil, soft drinks, sugar, etc., to supply her grocery store; Maribel who will buy shoes to fill orders; the young Santiago who will buy soft drinks by the case to begin his business; and Maricela who will buy catalogs to fill her first requests and begin her catalog sales business. \r\n\r\nThe young Maribel, who is 33 years old, studied up to the 3rd year of secondary and has her diploma. She is married and her husband works in the countryside, renting land and sowing onions. They have 2 children; Ismael is 11 years old and in the 6th grade in primary school, and Juaquin who is 4 years old. Maribel sells shoes, cosmetics, and lingerie by catalog. She is requesting a loan to buy shoes so she can fill shoe orders. She offers her customers shoes, clothing, cosmetics, and lingerie. \r\n\r\nWhen the business began some 2 years ago, initially, she helped her sister-in-law with sales. Later, Maribel bought catalogs and began to sell. Maribel began cautiously, with a selection she was offered and an initial loan. Her business is mobile; she goes from house to house, offering her products.  Keeping her business is important and special because if she wants some shoes for herself or her children, she provides them cheaper and con provide a discount.  Her favorite part of the business is when the customers pay! Some pay all in cash, others pay half down. Men are the best at paying. She remembers being awarded a packet of lingerie for having good sales each month. She has many customers: men, women, and girls. When there are closing ceremonies and parades, they buy more shoes. Their desire to have the same model makes her business popular; her brand is well-recognized. \r\n\r\nThe challenge that faces her business is that she offers shoes on payments and some people don't pay. The competition her business confronts is that many girls and women who sell from catalogs sell other brands. Maribel invests her earnings to buy more shoes; she plans to expand her business by providing cosmetics, lengerie, chothes, as well as shoes, and she hopes to do this with loans.\r\n\r\nHer business has helped her family when her husband couldn't provide income. From the earnings, she provides food and expenses. She wants to make improvements to her house, mainly the baths and building another bedroom. Her plans and hopes are to continue ahead with the business and keep on selling. Maribel is happy with this loan because she can supply her business with what people order. What she wants for her children is to provide schooling so that they will lack nothing. And this loan will help.\r\n\r\nThe group members wish to say to Kiva and Fundacion Realidad \u201cThanks for helping people who have needs because without your help we would not be able to get ahead.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuitzililla is a warm village with its countryside sown in onions, sorghum, and corn. They celebrate the day of their patron saint, St. Thomas, on the 21st of December; there are baptisms, first communions, processions, the running of bulls, and other ceremonies."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":701454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"TO BUY SHOES TO FILL CATALOG ORDERS AND OTHER MERCHANDISE ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huitzililla, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-28T22:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cruz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santiago ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":356.25,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850141},{"amount":356.25,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292415},{"amount":534.38,"local_amount":6375,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":6412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160673},{"amount":178.12,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233549}],"funded_date":"2011-01-29T04:49:55Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":273205,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elizabeth tiene 23 a\u00f1os, es soltera y tiene un hijo.

This is 50-year-old Ester N. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with four children between the ages of 20 and 31 years. Ester has been running a poultry (kuku) business since 2005. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.  She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Ester currently earns about 250 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 375 USD in order to purchase additional chicks and feed. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Ester thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional chicks and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T04:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":84062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436381},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":84062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130653},{"amount":62.49,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":84062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027450},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":84062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613451},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":84062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010531},{"amount":62.51,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":84062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232827}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T10:55:51Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Heistand","image":221619}},{"id":87997,"name":"Antonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sra.: Antonia tiene 40 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en Rene Cisneros en la capital de Managua, tiene un hijo de 19 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera lo cual tiene que sobresalir para apoyar a su hijo su negocio es la venta de palomitas, algodones, papas fritas y refrescos, desde hace seis a\u00f1os esta en las ventas, que inicio con fondos propios y con poca mercader\u00eda, ella desea invertir en materia prima para elaborar los productos que vende para esto esta solicitando solicitud en Afodenic que ser\u00e1 para ella de gran beneficio para seguir adelante con sus ventas de ricos y baratos dulces que d\u00eda d\u00eda sale a vender.

He lives with his girlfriend, their two children, and his sister in his own house.  Since he was very little he enjoyed working with his hands.  It is because of this that he learned the basic concepts of carpentry, which over time he has been able to perfect.  Today, he uses these skills to design and build guitars, which he manufactures from plywood or hardwood, according to the customer's order.  He only builds the body of the guitar, then his nephews apply paint and varnish to achieve a finished product.  Nicolas likes his work very much, since he is able to do it from his home, and can thus keep an eye on his sons, both of whom are in school and need lots of help and guidance from him with their schoolwork.  It is because of this that he wants to continue expanding his production and also the size of his workshop, in hope of solidifying his position as the best guitar manufacturer of his area. He knows the path will be difficult, since nothing is as easy as it seems, and he realizes he must be very careful and detailed in building his guitars, paying attention to all the final touches, so that they sound and shine as well as they ought to.  This is his first loan with MFP.  He was encouraged to take a loan by his sister, since she has belonged for many years to a communal bank from the same institution, and always come out well from her involvement with the bank.  With the money that he asks for he will buy large quantities of sheets of plywood and hardwood, so that he can increase his production.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":309282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Compra de madera","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-24T21:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nicolas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":149.19},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":156.71},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":163.2},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":170.66},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":177},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":183.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.49},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.93},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.04},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.46},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.52},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":48.49,"local_amount":149.19,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":150.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596122},{"amount":51.54,"local_amount":158.58,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":160.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990389},{"amount":52.79,"local_amount":162.43,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":163.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211511},{"amount":55.1,"local_amount":169.56,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":171.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641018},{"amount":117.08,"local_amount":360.24,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":363.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080477}],"funded_date":"2009-04-25T00:42:05Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":108477,"name":"Kalsoom M.

She lives with her life partner and has no children.  Lilia Flor is a young woman who enjoys working.  She tells us that she used to sell Avon cosmetics but then, through her own initiative, began to sell hamburgers in order to earn her own income.  With her initial, 300 sol, loan from Manuel Ramos Movement and with her partner's support, they bought a sandwich cart.  Later on she bought utensils and materials needed for better customer service.  Currently, she continues to sell hamburgers outside her house where there is a lot of pedestrian traffic and she tells us that her sales are good.  She starts selling at 6pm which is when many customers want a snack and she herself serves them with her characteristic good humor and charisma.

With the 500 soles he is requesting he will buy supplies for preparing his burgers and also wishes to purchase a blender. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Margaret Wolfe-Roberts, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":554130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase supplies for preparing burgers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:48Z","rounded_local_amount":94.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673428},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":94.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887251},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":94.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154260},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":94.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449568},{"amount":67.2,"local_amount":168,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":191.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588256}],"funded_date":"2010-06-17T03:57:05Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meg Wolfe-Roberts","image":555476}},{"id":211755,"name":"Genesis 1 & 2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yaina is the coordinator of her group Genesis.

She is a very responsible woman with three children under her care, who are the most important part of her life. She takes care of the children by herself, as she is a single mother. She has worked as the proprietor of a general store for 15 years, a business she started from her home. Little by little Maritza has managed to increase her sales as her number of customers has increased. Despite the difficulties she has faced, such as the lack of support since she has not had the sufficient amount of capital to invest in all the products, Maritza wishes to keep up with her business.
