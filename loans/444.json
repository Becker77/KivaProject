She lives in her own home together with her husband Hugo, 50 years old, and their 4 children. They are the reason for all their efforts. Sarita's work is to harvest carrots, potatoes and sweet peas. She works alongside her husband who has also worked very hard to provide their kids with a good education. She has seen it profitable to go to Bolivia with her products as they become available. That is where she gets the best prices. She makes sure to provide only the best care of her plantations, warding against insects and fertilize as needed.  In time she hopes to increase her productivity so that her sales will be better and her earnings increase. This is her tenth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). She is committed to making her payments on time, not wanting to cause any problems to her community group colleagues, where she is very well liked. With the two thousand five hundred soles she requests she will purchase more fertilizers for her fields and she will hire the help she needs in the plantations. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":593274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-02T13:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":381.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":395.02},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":408.97},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":423.4},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":438.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":452.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.21},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.22},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.43},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.8},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.36,"local_amount":381.55,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:17Z","rounded_local_amount":383.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154567},{"amount":142.21,"local_amount":395.02,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":397.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449879},{"amount":147.22,"local_amount":408.97,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":411.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588581},{"amount":152.43,"local_amount":423.4,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":426.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725083},{"amount":157.8,"local_amount":438.35,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":441.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463183},{"amount":162.98,"local_amount":452.71,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":455.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886589}],"funded_date":"2010-09-08T15:44:32Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":231869,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginia B. is from the village of Tambagan, Medina, Misamis Oriental.

With the loan, she will buy another buffalo.

He has been in this business for eight years and he considers the most difficult part of his work to be transporting his crops from his community to the storage warehouses in the towns of Quimbiri and San Francisco.\r\n\r\nOrlando will use the loan he has requested to buy materials with which to refurbish his home.  Over time, he hopes to be able to put together enough money to buy new land so that he can then leave them to his beloved children as an inheritance.  This will be Orlando's first loan and he is very happy to know that he will have the support of each of you and thereby be able to make progress.  He will use his 3,000 soles to buy building supplies with which to refurbish his home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":866623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy building supplies to improve the infrastructure of his home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-13T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orlando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":206.28},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":213.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":217.91},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":228.6},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":234.07},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":242.54},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":255.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":260.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":271.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":278.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":291.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":299.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.64},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.28},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.9},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.82},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.22,"local_amount":210.61,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:39Z","rounded_local_amount":210.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851308},{"amount":76.7,"local_amount":209.17,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":209.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666492},{"amount":346.97,"local_amount":946.28,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":946.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385532},{"amount":90.66,"local_amount":247.25,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":247.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098616},{"amount":91.4,"local_amount":249.28,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":249.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201947},{"amount":202.95,"local_amount":553.51,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":553.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097741},{"amount":214.1,"local_amount":583.9,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":584.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455242}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T13:31:24Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":338432,"name":"Ligia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Despu\u00e9s D. convertirse en madre cabeza D. hogar, Ligia se dedic\u00f3 a trabajar incansablemente para sacar adelante a sus 4 hijos, d\u00eda a d\u00eda se rebusca la manera D. generar ingresos que le permitan mejorar su calidad D. vida, por ello, desD. hace alg\u00fan tiempo se dedica a la cr\u00eda D. cerdos y pollos, y como ingreso adicional venD. arepas a sus vecinos y allegados.\n\nPara continuar con este negocio y esperando ampliar sus clientes, Ligia necesita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar 2 cerdos, cuido para los cerdos y pollos para el engorD.

is a 36 year-old woman from the small town of Monte Mercedes. Her husband\u2019s name is Rogelio Sequec and she has five children. She shows herself to be a very good mother, which is demonstrated by the fact that when she married, she also adopted as her own her husband\u2019s two children from a previous marriage. Of her own five children, four are currently studying. \r\n<p>\r\nShe only made it to third grade and couldn\u2019t continue studying because she had many brothers and sisters. Her father preferred that only the boys study until sixth grade, and she was destined to work in the kitchen with her mother. On occasion, her father would take her to the fields to help out with the corn crop and to do other agricultural work. \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she was 22 years old, she married and moved to the town of Concepci\u00f3n, Solol\u00e1, which is where she lives now. She works with her family to grow onions and they also have a small store. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Loan:<\/b> Rosita says that being able to invest capital in her business has been one of the best things that has happened to her. She realized that the amount she received almost seven months ago has made a difference in her business. She has been able to supply her store better and her sales have increased accordingly. The amount she is currently requesting is Q. 4,000.00 Guatemalan Quetzals (approx. $450.00).\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Dreams:<\/b> When asked about her dreams, she responds with tears in her eyes\u2026 \u201cI don\u2019t want my children to suffer like I have suffered from not knowing many of the things one learns in school. For this reason, my husband and I have decided to help our children get ahead, so that someday they won\u2019t have to work in the fields like we have had to do, because it is very hard work.\u201d\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b>\r\n<p>Rosita, es una mujer de 36 a\u00f1os de edad originaria de la aldea Monte Mercedes, esposa de Rogelio Sequec, madre de cinco ni\u00f1os y demuestra ser muy buena madre ya que cuando se caso tambi\u00e9n adopto como propios a dos hijos de su esposo de un matrimonio anterior, de sus cuatro hijos propios cuatro est\u00e1n actualmente estudiando<\/p>\r\n<p> Ella \u00fanicamente alcanzo el primer grado de primaria pero ya no pudo continuar debido a que eran muchos hermanos y el padre prefiri\u00f3 darles estudio \u00fanicamente a sus hijos varones hasta sexto de primaria y ella fue destinada a trabajar con la madre en la cocina y en ocasiones el padre se la llevaba al campo a trabajar en el calzado de la milpa y algunos otros trabajos agr\u00edcolas<\/p> \r\n<p>A los veintid\u00f3s a\u00f1os se caso y se traslado al municipio de Concepci\u00f3n, Solol\u00e1 en donde vive actualmente y se dedica junto a su familia al cultivo de cebolla, a la administraci\u00f3n de una peque\u00f1a tienda<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>CREDITO: Ella manifiesta que el brindarle un capital para su negocio ha sido una de las mejores cosas que le ha pasado, pues ella se da cuenta que con el monto que recibi\u00f3 hace casi siete meses ha visto un progreso en su negocio, ha podido surtir mejor su tienda y ve que las ventas igualmente han mejorado much\u00edsimo.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":427725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To purchase medicines in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-11-18T13:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Helena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757672},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146766},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984911},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015584},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740590},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":71824.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773704}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T15:16:46Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":157479,"name":"Tsengel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tsengel J. is a 21-year-old woman who lives with her parents and two youngest siblings in Bayanhongor Province, one of Mongolia's central provinces.

","en":"The \u201cLas Bendecidas\u201d (The Blessed Ones) is represented by Amparo and made up of 14 members who are in their second loan cycle.  They have shown unity, responsibility and the desire to continue growing to get ahead and make more progress every day.\r\n\r\nAmparo C. P. (group president) has a cosmetics sales business.  Thanks to her efforts, she continues to move forward in her work day to day.  She has two children and is separated from her husband.  Because of this, she overcomes obstacles in order to get her children ahead in life.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s a hard-working woman and has shown herself to be very responsible.  She lives under the anticretico modality (a transaction not available in the U.S. whereby a property owner requests a \"loan\" from you in exchange for housing, which must be paid back to you at the end of your contract. If your loan is not repaid, the property owner loses the property to you) and dreams with having her own home for her and her two children.  Amparo is making a great effort to reach this goal.  She will use the funds as working capital to continue growing in her business.\r\n\r\nAll the members of this group are multifaceted; they enjoy work very much.  Some sell food; others sell groceries, chickens, soft-drinks and turnovers.  Some sell milk, others vegetables. Some sell maja blanco (a sweet).  In this case, competition is non-existent because they all have different businesses and they all do well because they go out to different points of sale both within the city and to its outskirts in order to sell their merchandise. \r\n\r\nThe funds will be used to increase their ingredients, supplies and products in order to generate better income and meet customer demand.\r\n\r\nThe members already have quite a bit of experience in the field of group loans.  This is an established, very good group.  They completed their first loan cycle well with us and, to date, continue to prove themselves as being very hard-working and responsible people.

She is currently on her 13th loan cycle. She is 41 years old, divorced and the mother of seven children: four of them attend school, one is trained as a mechanic and two are too young to go to school. It is worth noting that she provides only for her children, because her ex-husband has completely left her.\r\n\r\nMasika's business consists of small-scale production of the traditional drink \"Mandrakwa\", which is made from corn with local technology. She began this activity with a start capital of US$60, just after the eruption of Nyiragongo Volcano in January 2002 had destroyed the whole economic infrastructure in the city of Goma. Thus she produced for 8 years \"Mandrakwa\" in her traditional production style.\r\n\r\nShe came to the microfinance institution Hekima and applied for this loan, which she will use to buy 32 sacks of corn to bolster her production capacity and increase her turnover. In addition, she wants to open a small store and buy a minibus for city transportation, since her oldest son has just finished his apprenticeship in automobile mechanics.\r\n\r\nMasika is thankful to MFI Hekima for the loans granted to her without any physical guarantee, because these loans enabled her to provide for her children and gradually build up some savings for her family.\r\n\r\nThis group is composed of 12 members, 11 women and 1 man, all pictured.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4100,"image":{"id":518540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy 32 sacks of corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Abdul is 41 years old and married.  He has five children between the ages of 3 and 16 years old.  His oldest four children go to school.  Abdul also supports his 20-year-old sister-in-law, who lives with the family.  Abdul started selling used clothing about ten years ago, and with the help of past loans from Tujijenge Tanzania, he now focuses on selling second-hand shoes.  Abdul has repaid all of his loans, and his business is going well.  He earns a profit of about US$ 150 per month.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Abdul plans to buy about 50 pairs of second-hand shoes for his shop.  He will select men's and women's shoes, sandals and boots.  With the profits, Abdul will continue to support his family and pay for food and school fees.  He hopes to reinvest additional savings into his business, and eventually open up a second location in the busy Kariako market of Dar Es Salaam. \r\n\r\nAbdul is the chairman of the Mpapai group.  The group's 17 members run a variety of businesses including salons, shops, tailoring, and charcoal sales.

In the morning she sells her merchandise in an elementary school.  In the afternoons she does the same work at a high school.  She generally sells dishes of food and sweets during the students\u2019 recess.  She makes these dishes with great care because her main customers are minors.\r\n\r\nThe business is well received, and it is growing.  That is why she believes that it is fitting to expand it with the purchase of more supplies.  Then she could prepare more dishes and increase her sales in order to achieve her goal.\r\n\r\nShe believes that is advisable to request a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 2,000 soles, which will help her meet her objective.\r\n\r\nJuan is a responsible and honest woman.  She has previously worked with our institution, and she has demonstrated punctuality and responsibility with her payments. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

They have seven children who are 4 to 21 years old. \r\n\r\nLeonora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Leonora has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 19,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use as additional capital for her fishing vending business and for fishing materials so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs.

She is married to Nonito, a salesman, and has three children. Together they manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEufemia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells cooked meat for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php8,000 loan. She will use it to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEufemia hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work.

Six of her children live on their own and one of her daughters and her grandaughter live at home with her. She has been an agricultural laborer for more than 40 years. During this time she has grown various crops such as potatoes, peas, corn, vegetables and more currently Gladiolus flowers. She will continue to grow these flowers because it has been very profitable for her since she contracted with people in a wholesale market in the capital. She no longer has to wait for May and November when she has the most demand but rather every 15 days she prepares the bales of flowers which have 12 dozen and sell for 20 soles. Feliciana takes between 20 to 25 bales on each trip and, once negotiated, her earnings are very good.  She accumulates an amount of 500 soles including her working capital.  She has since mainly planted flowers without abandoning her other crops.

This is 37 years old Selina L. from Mbozi. She is married   with 2  children, between the ages of 8  and 12. Selina has been running a fish  business since 2004. She owns and operates a small stall from which she sells roasted fish. She buys fresh fish daily from local fishermen as they come in with their morning catch, and then roasts and sells these fish either in the fish market on along the roads of the city. Given its location along the water, fish is plentiful in the waters around the city and is a staple of the local Tanzanian diet.  She is an enterprising micro-entrepreneur who is taking advantage of a local need to make monthly profits of $90.\n\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week.  She is requesting a loan in order to purchase fish in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to improve quality and range of product. Selina thanks you for your support!\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":427752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fish in bulk for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T14:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Selina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:10Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757676},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146770},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984915},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015588},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740594},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":71824.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773708}],"funded_date":"2009-11-25T00:22:47Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":157495,"name":"Cristeta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cristeta A. is from the village of Bayabo East.

This couple has two sons: David (20) and Javier (17), and they all live in their own home.\r\n\r\nFor the last 20 years, on top of being an excellent farmer, Leonor has been a very capable business woman. In the mornings she sells products from the sierra at the stall she has at a market in the city. After 10 a.m., she helps her husband with his house chores, since they work together both in the fields and in the home. They plant corn, potatoes, peas, and several vegetables that are in high demand in the market. What Leonor likes best is suggesting to her clients what to cook with the produce they buy. On the other hand, she doesn't like people at the market who take advantage of others.\r\n\r\nLeonor seems happy with what she does, but in the future would like to expand her business by offering more products, especially since her sales have gone up thanks to the great customer service she provides. \r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan Leonor requests from Kiva partner MFP. She is happy with her communal bank, where she tells us she learns from her fellow members' experiences. In hopes of a successful harvest, she will use the loan proceeds to buy several bags of fertilizer, and to invest in her little stall at the market. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":492733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buying fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-23T05:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2066.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886763}],"funded_date":"2010-02-23T12:07:30Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Violeta Rubiani","image":null}},{"id":182691,"name":"Marleny De La Cruz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marleny De La Cruz M.

Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de unos dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano, sin embargo varias veces al a\u00f1o, el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que caen en la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. Cuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en el Atl\u00e1ntico de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado por lo tanto la poblaci\u00f3n busca invertir con proyectos en la misma zona.\nDo\u00f1a Deyanira inici\u00f3 su negocio hace aproximadamente un a\u00f1o. Su objetivo es tener una actividad econ\u00f3mica rentable que no la obligue emigrar a Turrialba a buscar trabajo como empleada dom\u00e9stica. A\u00fan no puede mantener abierto el negocio todo el tiempo que quisiera ya que no tiene suficiente capital como para invertirlo en comprar toda la mercader\u00eda necesaria.

Deyanira comenta que el servicio que ella brinda es muy importante ya que no existe otra pulper\u00eda en la zona. Ella espera que el microcr\u00e9dito le ayude a impulsar su negocio, colaborar con la comunidad y que las personas no tengan que viajar hasta Turrialba para comprar sus abarrotes.\nDeyanira es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la microfinanciera EDESA.

She only had one son, and he is grown up and provides for himself. She lives in a small house where she also has her business, a small grocery store, where she sells basic products to her neighbors. The community in which she lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. It is a small, rural town with two thousand inhabitants. They work primarily in milk production and coffee farming. It has a hilly topography and most of the area is maintained as tropical rainforest. The town has very picturesque landscapes that combine the tropical forest with pretty ponds, coffee plantations, and dairies.\r\n\r\nEl Sauce is located approximately one-and-a-half hours by bus from Turrialba, the nearest center of commerce. However, several times per year the road becomes impassible due to the rains. This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest challenges for the community. When there weren\u2019t many jobs, many people chose to leave to look for work in Turrialba or in banana plantations located on the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica. Lately the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so now people from the area are looking for ways to invest in projects there. Deyanira began her business approximately one year ago. Her goal is to have economically feasible work so that she won\u2019t have to emigrate to Turrialba to work as domestic help. She still can\u2019t keep her business open as much as she would like because she doesn\u2019t have enough capital to invest in all of the necessary merchandise. She explains that having the business in her home means she doesn\u2019t have to pay rent or construct a building, which helps her move ahead with her business. \r\n\r\nWith the micro-loan she has requested, she hopes to buy more merchandise to sell and thereby grow the business and provide better service to her neighbors. Specifically, she will buy basic grocery goods, such as rice, beans, vegetables, canned goods, soft drinks, soap, and everything else that rural Costa Ricans typically need. Deyanira has commented that the service that she provides is very important because there is no other small grocery store in the area. She hopes the micro-loan will give momentum to her business and help her to collaborate with the community so that people won\u2019t have to travel to Turrialbla to buy groceries.  \r\n\r\nDeyanira is a client of the Producers Assocation of El Sauce, a local partner organization of the microfinance organization EDESA. Because of her ties to this organization, she has obtained several micro-loans for her business, which she has repaid satisfactorily. The amounts have increased from US$200.00, to US$550.00, to US$600.00. She currently needs a loan of $1,000.00 to buy the merchandise that is necessary to grow her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

Anita has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Anita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Anita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Anita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The members sell perfume, earrings, necklaces, pots, napkins, pastries and toys.  During their time with Emprender they have participated in 6 loan cycles; the founding members of the bank have remained, and they have expanded their membership by 10 percent.\r\n\r\nSenora Rosse Es is the leader, president, and one of the founding members of the bank.  This is her 6th loan cycle, and she is taking on the position of bank president.  She has been a merchant since she was very young; she sells jewelry and other miscellaneous items, including cosmetics.  She has 3 daughters; the middle daughter helps her with the sales.  Her husband does not generate much income, and for this reason she must continue to work to support her family so that she can help her husband so that the family lacks for nothing in the home, and so that she can proviD. support for the education of her children so that in the future they can have a profession and a better economic situation.  Her participation in the group came about thanks to her companions who invited her to join the group.\r\n\r\nThe loans they obtained were invested in their capital and were also used to allow the members to travel to sell in markets in other regions of the country such as Santa Cruz and Cochabamba.\r\n\r\nPatricia is one of the organizers and founders of a group that evolved into the communal bank Nueva Luz; she has worked with Emprender for 3 years.  She is the treasurer of the bank, and is one of the most dynamic members of the group; she has been very demanding of the other members during the time she has been with the group.  \r\n\r\nPatricia sells a variety of products (jewelry and other consumer goods) with her cart.  She travels with her products to markets and fairs to sell her goods.  She works with her husband in this business.  She has 3 daughters; her oldest daughter is 12, and the younger ones are 8 and 3 years old.  The loan she obtained helped her substantially in being able to improve the economic status of her family, and to proviD. a better life for her children, as she was able to generate an increased income by increasing her working capital. \r\n\r\nPatricia will use this loan to invest in the purchase of a store or sales post in one of the markets.  Her wish is to be able to have her own home and a store.  She hopes that these dreams will become reality in the future.  \r\n\r\nCristina Es, one of the founders of the bank, currently sells cosmetics, socks, rings, wallets and other items from a cart.  Cristina is an enterprising woman who supports her 2 daughters on her own.  She came to know the financial institution Emprender thanks to her companions, who invited her to become part of the group.  In this way she was able to access a loan, which helped her to increase her merchandise.  This was a great help to her, as thanks to the loan, she was able to pay for the education of her daughter who is in school.  In addition, Cristina makes quilts and bed sheets by hand in her free time.  \r\n\r\nAll of the members are grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the confidence they have provided in granting this loan.

Matilde is responsible for supporting the children and paying the family's other expenses because her husband abandoned the family several years ago.  She is an amazing mother who has managed to raise her children while working hard to support them.  Matilde operates a business selling fresh vegetables and grains, along with other produce.  She buys the products herself from a farm in the country and brings them to her town for sale.  She is applying for a loan so that she can buy potatoes, cheese, beans and meat that she will resell.

This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nNehemia is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Nehemia from ASKI.

It has 38 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk, and small business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Cienaga Grande Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"The women of this communal bank come from the community of Cienega Grande.  This community is located in a rural area within the Department of Solol\u00e1.  The most common crops grown in the community are corn and potatoes.  The residents are indigenous and the vast majority of them wear traditional clothing.  The women can be seen walking around the town wearing short or long skirts and huipiles\u2014traditional blouses made of handmade fabric\u2014or embroidered blouses.  Many of the men wear Western clothing, though some of them still wear traditional clothing.<p>\r\n\r\nMost of the members of the bank sell traditional clothing for a living.  Selling traditional clothing in the rural areas is a lucrative business because there is much demand for it, especially among women.<p>\r\n\r\nSome of the women in the group are going to invest their loans in other types of businesses, including a shoe store, a furniture store, a tortilla shop, and a shop that sells poultry.  The Brisas de Cienega Grande group includes a variety of non-traditional businesses.  This can be a factor that helps the women\u2019s business development in the communal bank, since all of them share their experiences with their various businesses.<p>\r\n\r\nMost of the women said that things were going well with their respective businesses.  When asked about competition, they said that it was present, but that it did not prevent their businesses from being successful.  The women who sell traditional clothing mentioned that all of their products are sold within the community.<p>\r\n\r\nThe members of the Brisas Cienega Grande group say that they enjoy working in a communal bank, mainly because they would not have been able to obtain a loan otherwise.  They also enjoy working together because they know each other well and know that they all have excellent credit records.<p>\r\n\r\nAnother factor that makes this group unique is that all of the women are able to support their children\u2019s education, and all of them send their children to school.  While it might seem like this should be the rule, this is unfortunately not the case in Guatemala, where the illiteracy rate is very high.  These women are thus helping their country to develop not just economically, but also socially.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Chris Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLas mujeres de este banco comunal provienen de la comunidad Cienega Grande. Esta comunidad est\u00e1 ubicada en un \u00e1rea rural dentro del departamento de Solol\u00e1. En esta comunidad la siembra de ma\u00edz y papa es lo m\u00e1s com\u00fan . Los habitantes de esta comunidad son ind\u00edgenas y la gran mayor\u00eda utilizan trajes tradicionales. Las mujeres caminan con cortes, faldas largas, y huipiles, blusas tejidas a mano, o blusas bordadas alrededor del pueblo. Muchos hombres utilizan ropa occidental, sin embargo se encuentran un grupo que todav\u00eda preservan su vestimenta tradicional. \r\n\r\n<P>La mayor\u00eda de clientas trabajan con ropa t\u00edpica. La venta de ropa t\u00edpica en las \u00e1reas rurales es un buen negocio porque hay mucha demanda por ella, especialmente el sector femenino de la poblaci\u00f3n. \r\n\r\n<P>En el grupo tambi\u00e9n se puede encontrar mujeres que van a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en una zapater\u00eda, muebler\u00eda, tortiller\u00eda y venta de pollos. En Brisas de Cienaga Grande se puede encontrar una variedad de negocios at\u00edpica. Esto puede ser un factor que ayude al desarrollo de las empresarias dentro del banco comunal porque todas intercambian experiencias de sus distintos negocios. \r\n\r\n<P>La mayor\u00eda de se\u00f1oras comentaban que les iba bien con sus respectivos negocios. Cuando se les pregunt\u00f3 sobre la competencia, ellas dijeron que si estaba presente pero no era un gran inconveniente para el \u00e9xito de sus negocios. Las se\u00f1oras que venden ropa t\u00edpica comentaron que todos sus productos se venden dentro de su comunidad. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Brisas Cienega Grande dicen que les gusta trabajar en un banco comunal, principalmente porque de otra manera ellas no hubieran podido sacar un pr\u00e9stamo. Tambi\u00e9n les gusta trabajar en conjunto porque todas se conocen bien y saben que todas tienen un record crediticio excelente. \r\n\r\n<P>Otro factor que hace a este grupo \u00fanico es que todas las se\u00f1oras realmente apoyan a la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. Todas mandan a sus hijos al colegio. Aunque al parecer esta deber\u00eda de ser la regla, no es la realidad de Guatemala. Los \u00edndices de analfabetismo son alt\u00edsimos. Es por eso que estas mujeres no solo ayudan al desarrollo econ\u00f3mico del pa\u00eds, sino al social tambi\u00e9n."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":166073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

They now have savings of GS.1,500,000 on deposit at a local Cooperative.  Moreover, they sponsor activities such as raffles and food sales to support a Caja D.

Now, he is fighting to recover and it is difficult to return to work.  Still, he is thinking about the future and hopes to save enough money for retirement and to better provide for his household.  \r\n\r\nDona Maria has been running a business selling second-hand clothing and cosmetics out of their home for 8 years, and also traveling to visit customers.  She first started the business to help generate more income for the family.  She specifically decided to sell second-hand clothing since she did not know what type of work she could do after she was previously a pork butcher.  They previously owned a small store, but they could not continue running the store while his illness required him to stay in bed.  Since she knew they still had to provide for the children, she began searching for other work.  She decided to sell second-hand clothing such as shirts and pants.  Since men started coming to the house to purchase pants, she decided to expand the business by traveling and selling on certain streets to earn more money.  The money she is requesting in the loan will be used to make necessary investments to buy additional merchandise for her business to meet the demand of the customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Josh Wilcox, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":267357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-10T18:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De La Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.12,"local_amount":842.3,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":842.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092061},{"amount":41.21,"local_amount":824.36,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":824.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985443},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:29Z","rounded_local_amount":833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446059},{"amount":41.92,"local_amount":838.39,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":838.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956696},{"amount":41.43,"local_amount":828.27,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":828.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055587},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599722},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:49:12Z","rounded_local_amount":833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035612},{"amount":125.01,"local_amount":2499.99,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2499.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789988},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680679},{"amount":41.63,"local_amount":833.37,"processed_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":833.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075230}],"funded_date":"2009-02-11T10:48:23Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Josh Wilcox","image":392254}},{"id":91785,"name":"Fatou Bintou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Fatou Bintou S., 34 ans est mari\u00e9e avec 03 enfants  en charge.

But most of all they are the best weavers in the Cusco valley. They have a very distinct technique and make scarfs, blankets, lace, ponchos, caps and beautiful works depicting nature. All of this is done by hand and with natural dyes. All of what they know they learned from their ancestors, and this knowledge is passed on from generation to generation. It also allows them to participate in the tourism industry, and they are very friendly people who want to share and keep their traditions alive. <p>\r\nWith the loan, the members will purchase seeds for their new crops, some heads of cattle for livestock, and alpaca and sheep fleece so their wives can continue weaving.

is a resident of San Vicente, Quirino, Isabela. She is already 55 years old and married to Nelson, a farmer.  They are blessed with three children: Janet, a 30-year-old computer-science graduate who is now working as a domestic helper abroad; Jonel, a 27-year-old driver\/mechanic graduate; and Joenard, a 23-year-old security guard. Lilia was glad and proud of her children because they learned to combat poverty by looking for a job. She just hopes that they will someday become successful with their chosen careers.  \r\n<p>\r\nLilia used to manage a sari-sari store (community-based store) in their village.  But for some reason it went bankrupt and closed for a time.  She is now asking for financial assistance from the lenders so she can be able to reopen her store. Her request of PHP 10,000.00 will be used to buy different groceries that she can display and offer to her customers. She is working hard to uplift their living conditions. According to her, she must be very patient in order to achieve her goals in life. \r\n<p>\r\nShe is thankful that her children also help them with their needs. Despite this, she still wants to have her own business and not depend too much on her children since they also have their own families.  She was very excited to have her store back that used to be her partner in sending her children to school.

She earns her living by buying and selling ready-to-wear clothes and accessories. Her husband Adelino A., who is 26 years old, works as a family driver to earn his living. They have an 8-year-old child. Maicel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maicel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 13,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth cycle loan, she is borrowing 17,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stocks to sell, so that she can continue saving up for the future education of her child. Maicel is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

As soon as she attains enough funding, Ashley plans on resigning from her current job and completely dedicating herself to starting the Capital Area Phoenix Initiative. \r\n\r\nAshley decided to start this non-profit because on a daily basis, she witnesses how challenging it is to navigate the medical system, especially with an isolating condition like HIV\/AIDS. This non-profit will help clients apply for Medicaid, insurance, food stamps, and find counseling and support. Furthermore, Ashley is dedicated to educating the public about the prevention of HIV\/AIDS as well, which differentiates her agency from others. Once Ashley finishes her certification for Medicaid at the end of November, she will be able to start taking referrals and working with clients. \r\n\r\nAshley plans on hiring six employees in the beginning to help her accomplish the tri-fold vision of her business: outreach and prevention, case management, and ultimately, a free clinic. Her goal is to open her doors on World AIDS day on Dec. 5th to offer free AIDS testing. Aside from applying for non-profit status, Ashley\u2019s biggest challenge was finding a space for an office that would be located within a larger building so that clients could enter the building without fear of being noticed. Ashley is very proud that she found the perfect location after looking for quite a while. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ashley plans on buying office equipment and signs. Ashley\u2019s motivation is unstoppable because \u201cI want to be a better person and be more humble about helping others. That\u2019s my goal in life. This infection could happen to anybody at any time. It doesn\u2019t differentiate between race, age, or gender. My goal is to prevent more people from getting this.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4775,"image":{"id":632178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"Office

Her family economy at that time was very poor because of lack of money and her husband was not in good health conditions. With the borrowed money from the Fund, she started breeding pigs. At first, she had one pig, and the number of pigs increased gradually. Her profit from breeding pigs was used to help her son build a house, and furnish her own home. Currently, she is breeding 30 pigs, each of 45kg and they are all ready to be sold. This time, she wants to borrow 1200 USD to expand her farm and buy more pigs. Her average income is 300USD\/ month. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb M\u1ea1c, 60 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 1995.

Three years ago, she decided to open her business, and due to her ability to cook, she chose to open a restaurant, which she started in her home.  Now it is located on one of the main streets of her town, which guarantees her sales.  Elizabeth offers lunch and dinner.  Her work begins every morning very early when she buys fresh ingredients for the meals that she needs to prepare.  At midday when she has many more clients, she needs her children and her mother to attend to the customers.  At night she has to clean.

A. lives in Santa Tecla, in the department of La Libertad. No one ever taught her how to cook, how to manage, and much less how to run a business. Her dreams were precisely to have her own business with her mother. With perseverance and faith in herself and the support of her family, she has had a small store for five years in her own house, where she started selling tortillas. Now she sells all kinds of products that are used on a daily basis. Curiously, her only daughter, Erica, is also 5 years old, which clarifies the great turn that Ana Cecilia took in her life in only half a decade. Ana is requesting a loan, since she considers this to be the right time to bet a little more on her family and buy new merchandise to grow her store. As life has taught her, desire, accompanied with effort and patience, leads to results. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva

El mes de octubre es una temporada donde hay gran demanda de flores y el precio sube, por ello trabaja junto a su esposa para la recolecci\u00f3n y preparaci\u00f3n de los ramos que transporta al mercado de flores de su ciudad, esta es una labor de mucho cuidado para no maltratar los p\u00e9talos. Mateo tiene la esperanza de que durante la \u00faltima semana de octubre podr\u00e1 obtener muy buenas ganancias, debido a la tradici\u00f3n en estos d\u00edas de visitar los cementerios. Y con estas ganancias podr\u00e1 solventar la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos.\n\nDurante sus tres cr\u00e9ditos anteriores con MFP, no tuvo dificultades de pago. Asimismo, su cargo como tesorero de su banco comunal lo viene cumpliendo responsablemente. Con el dinero que ahora solicita comprar\u00e1 semillas de arvejas e invertir\u00e1 en el preparado de la tierra para su pr\u00f3xima siembra.","en":"Mateo is a man with a great sense of humor; he is 40 years old and is the father of 5 children.  He has been involved in agriculture since childhood.  Currently, he is sowing potatoes and peas on a rented plot where he pays 1200 soles per hectare per year; at times he works just to pay the rent.  Therefore, Matthew works very hard to make the most of the land and has set out to plant gladioli, which has proved very profitable.  The month of October is a time when there is a great demand for flowers and the price rises, so he works with his wife to collect and prepare the bouquets that he then transports to the flower market in his city.  He must work very carefully so as to avoid damaging the petals.  Mateo is hoping that during the last week of October he will be able to have very good earnings, owing to the tradition in this area of visiting cemeteries during this time of year.  With these earnings he will be able to afford to educate his children. \r\n\r\nDuring his 3 previous loans from MFP he had no difficulties making the payments.  Also, he has carried out his position of treasurer with his communal bank very responsibly.  With the money that he is currently requesting he will buy pea seeds and will invest in preparing the earth for the next harvest.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

Their warmth and friendliness allow visitors to feel at home.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Aurelia F. is an active member of the Santa Ana Communal Bank.  She is 60 years old and lives in Santa Ana Parish with her husband.  Their three children are adults with their own families.  They all live under the same roof but assume different responsibilities and make sacrifices for the other family members.  Her husband works as a cattle dealer.  \r\n<p>\r\nAurelia prepares and sells food.  She butchers her own pigs for making savory dishes such as roasted pork, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sancocho\" target=\"_blank\" >sancocho<\/a>, blood sausage, etc.  Aurelia has been in this business for 20 years and says that there are both good days and bad, but she always manages to earn a little bit of profit.

Rosario has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately $100 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosario joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Rosario has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding her business. \r\n\r\nRosario is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which again will be used to invest in her business. This will be her 2nd loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.
