Beauty salons are widespread all over Kampala, and it's always the way beauticians handle clients that sells their services. If one's beauty salon has a reputation for servicing clients well, that will, without a shadow of a doubt, play in the favor of that business. That is what has been unfolding at Deborah's salon. She and her employees aim at offering the best of service to not only their usual clients but also new clients. This has endeared them to many people, most especially women.\r\n\r\nNot everything has been going well, however. She says the rising cost of doing business in most of East Africa has not spared her business. She says most of the cosmetics and other equipment she uses at her salon are increasingly becoming expensive. As a result, her business's growth has been stifled somewhat.\r\n\r\nShe remains upbeat, hoping for a favorable turn in circumstances soon. For a woman who was previously a housewife, this progress and attitude in the face of business adversity is encouraging. This mother of three says this business's gross profits total up to 500,000 Ugandan shillings weekly.  She says this Kiva loan will come in handy in the purchase of more cosmetics, hair dryers and other hair products to use at her salon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4700,"image":{"id":816700,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more cosmetics, hair dryers and other hair products to use at her salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-21T03:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4700,"lender_count":154,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deborah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anjellah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daisy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aron","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gorret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ronald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":12000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":587.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1611.86,"local_amount":4115391,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T08:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4118306.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222022803},{"amount":592.16,"local_amount":1511898,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1512968.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227249006},{"amount":2476.4,"local_amount":6322713,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-04T09:29:10Z","rounded_local_amount":6327191.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868576},{"amount":19.58,"local_amount":49998,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":50033.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648613}],"funded_date":"2011-07-25T03:49:47Z","paid_date":"2012-02-02T09:26:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Liz Nagle","image":784126}},{"id":322494,"name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 04 enfants.

After having correctly repaid their six preceding solidarity loans, they are now on their seventh, which will be used to buy:  forty bags of henna processed into powder, six boxes of band-aids (for the henna), one bag of urea (used for enriching the black color of the henna), ten boxes of bar soap, three dozen of liquid soap, three bags of millet, two bags of beans, 50 kg of <i>gueni<\/i> and <i>magnonkiss\u00e8ni<\/i> (seeds of wild exotic plants), and five bottles of <i>eau de cologne<\/i>.  The <i>gueni<\/i>, <i>magnonkiss\u00e8ni<\/i>, and the perfume are made into incense to be sold.  \r\n<p>\r\nSupplies are gotten at the grand marketplace of S\u00e9gou and sometimes in Tissala.  Sales are made to customers essentially composed of women, cash or credit accepted, in their homes, door-to-door in town, at the M\u00e9dine marketplace, and sometimes at the grand marketplace of S\u00e9gou. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members hope to realize an average monthly profit of 39,500 francs CFA that will be use to repay the loan, to participate in social events, and to cover certain family expenses.  Their ambition is to buy cows to obtain milk to drink and to sell, as well as to use their dung as organic manure to fertilize the fields.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":300403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy various goods ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mah\t                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tenin                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan\t                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abi\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tin\u00e9                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":608.33,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":300790.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621212},{"amount":304.17,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":150395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020173},{"amount":304.18,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":150395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242928},{"amount":304.17,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":150395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678639},{"amount":304.15,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:36Z","rounded_local_amount":150395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112544}],"funded_date":"2009-05-04T20:57:21Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":104493,"name":"Burhoniddin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"T.

Being in this business for 20 years, he knows very well how to choose the animals, how to breed them and look after them. Thus, he gets up every morning in order to feed the animals and to look after them.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with a wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures and traditions of native African people. She works at the business for nine to 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by her husband. Ester currently earns about $100 a month from her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Paquito is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be his fifth loan from GDMPC.

It is the second largest city in Pakistan and the capital of Punjab province. She is the mother of three children \u2013 two daughters and a son. Her older daughter is studying in 5th grade and her son is in 2nd grade, while her younger daughter is just 5 years old and has not started to attend school yet. \r\n\r\nGulshan is living in a small two-room house where she moved after her marriage to D. H.. Her husband has a shop in the market where he sells milk and yogurt. His business is doing well and he is earning a good income. Gulshan has applied for a loan from Asasah for her husband\u2019s business.  This is her 3rd loan with Asasah, and she has proved to be a responsible lendee, never missing any meetings.

Sumaliring, Siaton, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: fish vending and food vending businesses. Her husband Obaldo D., who is 46 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children who are 12 to 22 years old.\r\n\r\nJohnita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Johnita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to as additional working capital so that she could continue to save up for the future of her children's education and family. Johnita D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Until 2004, Oyungerel worked as a retail staffer for several local companies. \r\n\r\nSince 2005, Oyungerel has supported her family by operating a jewelry retail stall at Narantuul, the largest outdoor market in Mongolia. She began her business by distributing silver rings, necklaces, earrings and bracelets to local customers. Now her working capital is about 1.5 million MNT and its turnover is twice a month. She purchases her products from a Turkish jewelry wholesale supplier. \r\n\r\nHer moderate revenue supports her standard of living, though she would like to buy her own indoor jewelry store because the outdoor stall is difficult to work at due to weather conditions.  She is requesting a 500,000 MNT loan to invest in working capital before the Mongolian Lunar New Year holiday.  She believes that this loan and future loans will help her achieve her goal.  \r\n\r\nOyungerel\u2019s biggest dream is to see her daughter to be successful in life and to help provide that opportunity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":702558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

This is forty-three-year-old Salma M. from Mwanza. She is married with five children, between the ages of eight and eighteen. She is also responsible for supporting a young girl who is an orphan. \r\n\r\nSalma has been running a poultry business since 2004. In her business she sells chickens as well as eggs. She works at the business for four hours a day, seven days a week with the assistance of two employees. Salma currently earns about $500 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 to buy more chicks which she will raise and resell. In the future, she plans to open another business. Salma thanks you for supporting her!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their business equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, which enables them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":290575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more chicks to raise and resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613669},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010748},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:04Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233034},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664825},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105537},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022665},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867914},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757115},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146227},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984389}],"funded_date":"2009-04-01T23:50:06Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":100413,"name":"Akeem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akeem A. is 33 years old and married with two children.

Her daughter attends a local secondary school and her husband helps Davaadulam with her business where she sews lightweight leather coats that are suitable for the spring and fall weather here in Mongolia. She started her business in 2000 by hand making all of her own coat designs. Today, because of her poor eyesight, the construction of the coats is done by a local seamstress, but Davaadulam does all of the designing and selling of her coats. Her working capital recently reached 2,000,000 tugrug (~1400 USD) and her target market is local middle-aged women. Her designs are selling quite well, however she would like to expand her product line to include winter coats which can be sold at a higher price and would broaden her customer base. She would also like to eventually move to a workspace that is closer to her home and more comfortable than her current workspace. Davaadulam is requesting a 1,700,000 (~1200 USD) loan to purchase materials which can be used to help her begin making winter

Everyday Elmer works as a day laborer on the farms of his neighbors, from 8 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon. His job is to remove the weeds and thus clean the fields, allowing for a good development of the crops. Working in this manner is satisfying and profitable, as Elmer makes agreements to finish a certain amount of land in 15 days, and then finishes the agreed amount with his wife in only 9 or 10 days. He then spends the extra time working on his coffee crop, thus he is able to take care of his own harvest. Elmer likes farm labor, although sometimes the process of cultivating the coffee is long and difficult, but that is his way of earning more money.\r\n\r\nThis is Elmer's second loan with MFP, where he has agreed to make all the payments on time and to continue working as the secretary for his communal bank.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is also a fisherman and gets a low income from fishing.\r\n\r\nMuna wants to improve her family life by purchasing new home furniture such as bedroom furniture for her and for her children, living room furniture, etc., but she hasn't enough money to pay, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Muna gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to purchase the furniture her family needs. This will offer to Muna and her family better and healthier living conditions.\r\n\r\nMuna is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead at the FATEN branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About this loan product:<\/b>\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She lives with Cerefino, her husband of 25 years. They have 5 children. They take care of only 4 of them in their own house, which is located in the annex of Usibamba. Every morning as is her custom, she goes to take care of her crops as it is the season and she needs a good harvest. Her principal crops are alfalfa, grass, oats and other food for her animals, as she breeds cows. She already has 8 cows, 3 of which are pregnant and so do not give milk. Although now feeling the pinch, she knows that this will not last forever as when the calves are born her cows will give her good milk which she will sell at a good price. However, what she likes doing the best is weaving. While going about her daily chores, she makes various garments such as sweaters, rugs, quilts and other accessories made from wool. This gives her extra income and she also enjoys the work. She belongs to the communal bank \"Usibamba\" and this is their 3rd loan with MFP, from which she is hoping to receive a small loan to reach her goals. On the other hand, she promises to make her repayments, as the members of her bank are responsible and very supportive people. Amelia on receiving your support, will invest the money requested to purchase 2 milking cows with which she intends to increase her number of cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":904358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 2 cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-26T13:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3057.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712950}],"funded_date":"2011-10-26T20:47:42Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":355343,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is 29 years old and a father of two children.

Ricmar has been engaged in his business for more than10 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ricmar joined GDMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ricmar is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase fishing net. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Ricmar from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve his business and to support his family's basic needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Emma is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell to expand her product offerings. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Emma from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.

Her husband works as steam engine fireman at a school. During many years Synzhibek together with her husband have been saving money so they could buy some kind of livestock. Finally, their labor efforts have been successful and they have bought their first cow. Because Synzhibek's husband is always at the school and main responsibilities for taking care of the cow have been placed on Synzhibek's shoulders. She got used to the new business quickly and soon started to show interest in getting a calf. She has concluded that in today's circumstances animal husbandry is a profitable business. Her husband helped with the new investment and they also started to get additional income from milk sales. It has been fifteen years as Synzhibek and her husband have been doing animal husbandry. They buy calves, feed them for one year and then resell. Right now Synzhibek enjoys doing her business. During these fifteen years animal husbandry has been a source of meat, milk and a substantial income from the sales of cattle and meat. Synzhibek and her husband were able to build a house. Just the milk sales alone bring them 2,400 somoni a month. Synzhibek has bought her first cow for only 2,000 somoni. Right now she is planning to buy a calf for feeding and resale, but she does not have the finances to realize her purchase. This is why she has asked for a loan. \r\n\r\nSynzhibek has three group partners:\r\n\r\nErkingul O. is thirty three years old. She is a mother of two children. Erkingul's husband works in construction. Erkingul breeds the cattle herself and also resells it as well as sells the milk. Erkingul needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nSaltanat D. is forty eight years old. She has three children. Saltanat's husband is a medical worker in a hospital.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: wholesaling electronic reloading credits, fattening pigs and operating a tricycle transportation business. \r\n\r\nHer husband Vicente A. Jr., who is 40 years old, works as a forwarder (Margie's Door to Door Services) to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child, who is 17 years old. \r\n\r\nMary Ann joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mary Ann has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 29,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to pay for more load (mobile-phone credits) so that she could continue to save up for future, build her own house and widen their pig-fattening business. \r\n\r\nMary Ann A. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a food-vending business. She has eleven children aged between 22 and 42 years.\r\n\r\nAlfreda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she wished for something better for her family. With the help of her past twelve loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Alfreda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 56,000, uplifting her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan, Alfreda is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her business, while some she gave to her daughter who is looking for a job, and some she will continue to save for future capital and for tuition fees.\r\n\r\nAlfreda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is 46 years old. Dionesia is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Millions.\r\n\r\nDionesia is married and has an adult child. To make a living, Dionesia owns and operates a retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as canned goods, noodles, sugar, shampoo, soap and toothpaste. Dionesia has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 1,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Dionesia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Dionesia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Dionesia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It is located in the Hueyapan community, Tetela del Volcan, in the state of Morelos.  The group is comprised of four members who are neighbors and know each other.  This is their first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.\r\n\r\nCelia M. F. is the group\u2019s representative.  She is 43 years old, and she has a sixth grade education.  She has three children, one boy and two girls.  Eudocio is 28 years old and works in the United States.  Miriam is 20 years old.  Herminia is 16 years old, and she just finished high school.\r\n\r\nCelia sells soft drinks and \u201cchicharrones\u201d (fried pork rinds) in her house in Rancho Los Tejocotes.  Her house is one of the last houses on the hill.  She requested her loan to buy cases of soft drinks; the brands Jarrito and Red Cola in the two liter size; oil, sugar, and chicarrones.  She says that she started her business two years ago.  Her son that is in the United States sent her money, and she decided to buy soft drinks and chicarrones in order to start selling.\r\n\r\nHer customers are her neighbors.  When they go to work in the fields they pass by and purchase soft drinks or chicharrones.  Her daughters help her with the business because they realize it is important.  That is where they get income for food and the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy with the loan she was given.  She expects to see her business bigger and better stocked.  \r\n\r\nIn her community of Hueyapan there is a lot of vegetation and pine trees.  There are also fruit trees like pear, apple, peach, cherry, and \u201ctejocote\u201d (Mexican hawthorn).  The climate is mild, and there are also animals. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\n*Herlinda P. A.:  Will buy cherry, peach, and apple plants to plant\r\n*Yolanda A. C.:  Will buy fertilizer and insecticide by the kilo and in bulk to provide maintenance to her fruit trees\r\n*Judith M. P.:  Will buy young sheep and pigs to raise and sell\r\n\r\nThe members of the group want to tell Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cWe appreciate your faith in us and the support you are providing us with the loan.

Nghi\u00eam Th\u1ecb is 49 years old living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh. She is married and has one school-aged child. Nghi\u00eam has a butcher shop from which she butchers and sells pork to the local community. She has been in business for over 17 years and earns approximately 2,800,000 VND a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007 Nghi\u00eam joined SEDA to gain access to its financial services. She successfully repaid her previous L. of 6,944,000 VND from SEDA that she used to invest in expanding her business. Nghi\u00eam is now requesting a new L. of 8,736,000 VND that will also be used to invest in the business. The L. will be the fifth L. taken out by her from SEDA. She plans to use all additional revenue to expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n<p>\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this L. was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English and Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nL.

Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 7500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Teresita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods & junk foods. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Teresita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":712861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

When she is not working, Lucia enjoys attending her local church several times a week.\r\n<p>\r\nLucia Matinez is the leader of the 10 person micro-bank, Las Mujeres Luchando Contra La Pobreza, which means, The Women Fighting Against Poverty.  Each of these unique Dominican entrepreneurs unite in solidarity, allowing them to access funding that they would otherwise never be able to receive on their own.  The concept of this group bank paying their loan together is to reduce the risk of one person defaulting, as the others members gladly help cover one another\u2019s payments in order to receive their next loan together.  One of the other women in the group has runs a small salon, one sells vegetables in the street, and several of the others sell clothing to in the streets and markets of Puerto Plata.\r\n<p>\r\nOn behalf of Lucia, the Mujeres Luchando group, and the entire team here at Esperanza International, we thank you for your support and awareness of the global issue of poverty, in which your efforts are helping to make a difference."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":178077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy rice, cooking oils, sugar, and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Puerto Plata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.75 -70.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2008-07-08T19:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Medeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fifa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dieulene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanesa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olguita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Leonarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Severina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-29T04:14:46Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":49000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":8166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":241.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":242,"local_amount":8177.93,"processed_date":"2008-08-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T09:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":8273.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":310089},{"amount":242,"local_amount":8177.93,"processed_date":"2008-09-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":8273.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":341126},{"amount":241,"local_amount":8144.14,"processed_date":"2008-10-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-30T07:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":8239.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373395},{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":8166.68,"processed_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":8262.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312779},{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":8166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":8262.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9930326},{"amount":241.66,"local_amount":8166.65,"processed_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:52:45Z","rounded_local_amount":8262.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854900}],"funded_date":"2008-07-15T04:14:46Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T11:52:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":59482,"name":"Olga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olga is single.

In spite of being separated from her partner she always provided what was necessary for her children, and thanks to the help of her parents and family members they have a warm home in which they all live together in her parents\u2019 home. The demands of being a parent pushed her to look for work in order to manage her responsibilities. Finding an opportunity in a telephone company, she worked as promoter of sales over the last fifteen years. Then she started a more independent business, within the same company, that consists of selling prepaid telephone calls, useful to people with limited resources and scarce possibility of having a telephone in their home. In this way she helps people with limited resources have a means of communication. Doing this gives her great satisfaction, not only for the financial gain or the demand, but because she contributes to the development of her district and her city. Nevertheless, Marcela hopes in the future to set up a business selling phones and phone cards in her home to provide a full-time service while leaving the weekend to continue helping, as much as possible, people in poorer areas. This is her first loan with MFP. She is committed to being responsible and punctual, and work alongside teammates who are very dynamic and hardworking, to enable their community bank to grow. The money she is requesting will be invested in the purchase of telephones that she needs to sell in upcoming months, because in some cases the sale is by credit, and she has to cover payments for several months.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jo Longnecker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":300575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase in merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-09T22:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":116}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.18,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:52:35Z","rounded_local_amount":123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012415},{"amount":39.19,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596003},{"amount":39.19,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990267},{"amount":39.2,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211391},{"amount":39.19,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640900},{"amount":39.19,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080367},{"amount":39.86,"local_amount":116,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":125.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996558}],"funded_date":"2009-04-10T00:37:32Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jo Longnecker","image":606476}},{"id":104557,"name":"Rosalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Rosalie D. is 32 years old and a resident of Tudela, Misamis Occidental.

Nevertheless, she fully repaid her loan to Sudan Microfinance. \r\n\r\nMary has now joined the Kiva field partner, Brac South Sudan. She sells charcoal wholesale at her store and wants a loan to hire a lorry for the transportation of charcoal from the producers to her store.  Mary is thirty-two years old and married to a businessman. She has three children who all attend school, and with the extra profits from her loan, she hopes to be able to pay school fees for her children. \r\n\r\nBRAC's holistic approach to poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor encompasses a range of core programs in economic and social development, health, education, human rights and legal services, which are delivered through an extensive network of village organizations. BRAC has become one of the world's largest NGOs as measured by the scale and diversity of its interventions.  In 2007, BRAC started operations in Southern Sudan. The microfinance program, which is targeted toward returning war refugees, has already formed 418 village organizations with more than 14,000 women members.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":319886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

She tells us that some time ago she began to sell sweetcorn to her acquaintances and relatives. Later she was able to acquire a cart to sell her product, since her residenc is close to the central market in the city of Toluca. Little by little her business grew. With the savings she was able to amass over a long time she decided to start a business with her family and thus began the client's sucess story. Despite having a \"harelip\" and being a victim of teasing in her community, she has been able to get ahead. With her family's help, her greatest dream has always been for her youngest son, Juan Pablo, who is in elementary school, to be an attorney. With that achievement all of her hard work and sacrifice will have been worth it. The loans that the institution has given her have been to develop her business and with it obtain a better quality of life for her and her family. With the next loans she receives she wants to move her business to a different place and with it obtain more profit.

The most important thing for her is to provide her family with what they most need.\n\nTranslated from Spanish:\n      La se\u00f1ora Catarina es casada  con el se\u00f1or  Jes\u00fas y con quien procreo tres hijos  que aun est\u00e1n a su responsabilidad, en donde ella vive es un lugar muy bonito donde hay mucha vegetaci\u00f3n y las personas se dedican a  la artesan\u00eda.\n\nElla se dedica a su hogar y solicito el pr\u00e9stamo para invertirlo en la compra de \u00fatiles escolares ya que se dedica a la venta de \u00fatiles escolares desde hace seis a\u00f1os y comenta que le va bien ya que con ello esta aumentando d\u00eda con d\u00eda, ya que una de sus hermanas es la que le surte con la mercanc\u00eda.\n\nLa que la inspiro fue su hermana quien trabajaba en una papeler\u00eda y es quien le dijo que ser\u00eda buena idea abrir una papeleria ya que cerca de la casa de la se\u00f1ora Catarina hay una escuela secundaria y as\u00ed tendr\u00eda buenas ganancias.\n\nLo que desea con esta actividad es que pueda  tener un mejor ingreso y con ello salga a delante con su familia que es lo m\u00e1s importante para ella darle lo m\u00e1s necesario."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":812334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy school supplies and stock her stationery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2059.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201823},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1029.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807414},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1029.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618509}],"funded_date":"2011-08-02T02:27:28Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":322574,"name":"Fortune","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This borrower is a 41-year-old Rwandan entrepreneur with three children between 2 and 9 years old.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 45,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nDelia dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies there.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
