He is married and a father of five children. Since childhood, he has faced many obstacles in life because his parents were poor and could not send him to school after grade seven. Instead he began doing odd jobs in the neighborhood to take care of himself and his younger siblings. \r\n<P>He has decided that his children should not suffer from poverty like he has. With this goal, he joined GHAPE 2002. He has borrowed and repaid loans amounting to $500. He invested these loans in fattening pigs and rearing fowl for sale. The profits from these loans provided for the educational needs of his children. He also purchased a piece of land and built the foundation for a three-room house. He is very proud of what he has been able to accomplish with GHAPE\u2019s help and is presently the treasurer of his GHAPE centre.\r\n<P>\r\nGiven this loan, Zacariah plans to buy nails, slabs, pigs, and piglets.  He will also expand the enclosure for his pigs. He wants to concentrate mostly on pig farming because will generate the most income.  The demand for pigs and piglets is high in his community.\r\nHe believes his business will be successful because the piglet he purchased with his first loan is still producing more piglets.  He has had a lot of experience in this field, has the land to rear the animals, and has a farm which produces enough food for the animals to feed on. The GHAPE trainings are going to help his business succeed because he is going to the skills he learned into practice. <P> \r\nHe plans to repay this loan in 24 months with the first repayment beginning four months after disbursement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":177102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase lumber, nails, piglets as well as pay for labour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Mbengwi, NW.

Previously, each one in the group received a loan of 500,000 LE. That loan created meaningful impacts in lives of these people. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees. They\u2019re also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans. Having repaid their last loan successfully, they are now requesting a loan of 700,000 LE each to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n<P>\r\nHumu (right) is the leader of the group. She is thirty-eight years of age. She was born in the village called Sanda Taindarim about thirty miles from Makeni and fifteen miles from Masori. Today, she is married and living in Masori village. Her and her husband have two children, both of whom are attending schools in Freetown. Her husband serves as Section Chief for the people of Masori. His duties include hearing and settling minor disputes between members of the community.\r\n<P>\r\nHumu sells palm oil, rice and other locally produced items in the Masori village. She has been in this business for over ten years now. With this new loan, she will expand her business. She will be able to buy about ten to fifteen barters of palm oil (five gallons make up a barter). A barter of palm oil costs 30,000 LE. She will then choose to either sell in Masori village or take them to Makeni depending on the where she can get better profit. \r\n<P>\r\nTo date, she has not encountered any great challenges worth noting.

She's been working as a domestic worker since she was eight years old.  The difficulty has been to gain the confidence of her employers.  Her house is small, the walls are unplastered and it has an earthen floor.  The bathroom is inside because she doesn't have the means to build one outside.  She has her small wages along with a small income she receives from the father of her children with which she pays for school expenses, water and lighting.  She uses her wages to pay for food.  Her goal is to work until her children are able to make their own way in the world.\r\nWhat she wants most is to be able to continue fixing up her house.  With the previous loan she was able to buy the doors in order to have better security.  With this loan she wants to buy a toilet, since she now has a latrine which is old and she wants to be able to have better hygiene.  She will buy cement and sand to make a drain and to pay to have it installed.  And to be able every day to have a dwelling fit for her children.  She is pleased with AFODENIC for providing loans to poor women who, thanks to this financing, are able to improve their housing.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kvaka, Kiva

The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale.

C. is now requesting a new loan of 7.840.000 VND, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the third loan she has taken out from SEDA.

She has a business where she offers internet services, international calls, and photocopies.  Most of her customers are young students attending high schools and universities.  Her business started from the time her brother offered it to her in May of 2009.  At first she counted on his experience.  He stayed with her everyday for two months.  That is how she learned to manage it so well.\r\n\r\nDoris is single, and she does not have children.  She lives with her three siblings.  One of them is allergic.  The floor in her house is very rudimentary and in bad shape.  It emits a lot of dust even though it is constantly cleaned.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to improve the house\u2019s conditions, and that is why she is asking for her second loan for 2,300,000 pesos from the Mario Santo Domino Foundation.  She will buy construction materials to improve the floor and the bathroom, which is on the patio.  It is also in very bad shape.  At the same time, she want her house be more secure by putting up a wall.  That way she will have more control over the people who enter.  The patio is not sheltered from the neighbors.\r\n\r\nMrs. Guzm\u00e1n is a very active woman.  She participates in the social pastoral community in the church.  She also volunteers in the school dining room, which is located in the parish.  Her family is characterized as being very united, supportive, and loyal followers of the church of God.

R. is a 44 year old gentleman who lives with his wife in the community of El Sauce de Santa Tersita in Turrialba, Cartago Province.  This small rural community has approximately 2000 residents, most of whom make their living by producing milk and growing coffee.  The area is hilly and much of the land consists of humid tropical forests.  In addition, the community has picturesque views that combine the tropical forests with two beautiful lakes, coffee plantations, and dairy farms.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Miguel and his family have dedicated much of their time to their dairy business.  They focus even more of their time now that a cheese factory has been built in their community by the El Sauce Milk Producers Association.  Since he has experience, Miguel is able to take care of all the demands required of his business.  In addition, he has imparted his knowledge to the rest of his family over time.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Miguel wants to obtain a microloan of 500,000 CRC in order to buy another dairy cow so that he can increase his milk production by more than 40 liters per day, which will allow him to grow his business.  He wants to become a successful micro-entrepreneur so that he can help his family get ahead and pay for his son\u2019s university expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Miguel is a member of El Sauce Association of Producers, one of 100 member organizations that make up EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his eighth loan and he hopes to continue growing on a personal and financial level.  He says he is extremely grateful for the assistance the organization has provided so that he can accomplish his goals.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

For this reason, she is planning to open her own agricultural store where she will not only sell farming products but also provide training and teaching.  Now her project is to sow potatoes and beans in the land which her father gave her as an inheritance.  \u201cRight now, I will just begin with a small production\u201d, she confirms. \r\n\r\nThis is Judith's first loan with MFP and she is happy to belong to a community bank which has such successful members with many ambitions.

She lives in her own home with her husband H\u00e9ctor, age 52, and their two beloved children for whom she wants to provide a better quality of life.  Julia works very hard on her farm to provide everything she needs to support her family.  Before the first rays of sunlight appear, she leaves her house and walks almost an hour before reaching her land where she grows potatoes, corn, and peas.  These products are eventually sold at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.  What she enjoys most about her work is cultivating her land, which she feels has been put to good use.  Julia has been farming for thirty years and considers the most difficult part to be transporting her products to Tarma because the sacks are heavy and the work is tiring.  Within time, she wants to buy additional farmland so that she can increase her production.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  Julia is pleased to access this loan and wants to express her appreciation to everyone who made it possible for her to obtain the money she needs.  She is a well-respected member of her Communal Bank because she tries to keep the meetings orderly.  The loan of 2000 PEN that she requested will be used to buy more compost to make her land more productive.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":738451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase sacks of compost.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-27T21:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2016.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665938}],"funded_date":"2011-03-28T01:28:12Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":289418,"name":"Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"V.

She sells drinks, such as beer, soft drinks, wines, and pisco, which are rapidly consumed by her neighbors because she is well-known for selling only drinks that are of good quality and not adulterated. What she likes most about her work is talking with her customers. This makes her long work days more pleasant.

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":123243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Secretarial

age from 22-4 years old. They live in Pandan, a beautiful coastal town in the north of Antique province. When she started her business three years ago, it was just a small capital to buy and sell rice for consumption. With every loan, she is able to expand just a little bit more. With this loan of 22,000 Pesos, she is going to buy 60 sacks of rice to sell in smaller quantities. She is going to buy two piglets and the feed and vitamins they need to go strong and fat and be ready for market.\n\nOn the side, she has also started a manicure business where she goes to her neighbors to give them manicures and pedicures. This is good for her and her family because if the weather is bad or typhoons hit, she has more than one way to keep an income.\n\nHer hope is to be able to save enough to help all of her children finish school. She's like to help her husband open a store of his own and hopefully one day build a big enough house for all her children to be able to live there to. For Nida, family is always the most important thing.\n\nWritten by Sloane Berrent, Kiva

SPBD's loans are Faatupu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faatupu P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.65 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Her previous loan of PHP 27,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 35,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to buy feed, medicine and vaccines for the pigs, and repair the fishing boat so that she can continue to save up for future education and expansion of business. Maricel is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

It was a traditional trade that she learned from her mother, who supported herself this way when her father died.  Gradually, Nancy perfected her art.  Her sister taught her to make pants and with practice and repetition, she got more skills, which she now uses in her work today.  When she started her business, she made pants, shorts, and infants shirts, but she has gradually expanded her merchandise and now also makes items for women.  In addition to sewing, for five years she has worked selling merchandise through specialized product guides.  \r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, her seventh loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization she has worked with for twelve years.  With the loan, she will purchase raw materials and supplies since December is a time when she never stops working.  She celebrates the new year with her neighbors with her machine at hand, and this is how she is successful.  \r\n\r\nDuring the time she has worked with FMSD, Nancy has been known as a loyal member of the organization.  Her business has shown large growth with her working capital and her diversification of products.  This is due to her responsibility and hard work that makes her a good small business

He became engaged in this business, because he saw the transportation need of the residents of his neighborhood, and because he saw that he could obtain a good income.\r\n\r\nMardoni is very thankful for the Kiva loans since, thanks to the support provided, he was able to buy another mototaxi for his business. In this way, he can obtain greater income and transport the residents of his neighborhood, since it is very far away, and there are not very many transportation means for passengers. Additionally, Mardoni wants to continue progressing in order to get ahead, since he will continue saving to achieve in a few months his biggest dream: \u201cto have this own mototaxi business.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":963174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy a motorcycle taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ca\u00f1ete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-28T07:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mardoni Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":135.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":138.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":148.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":149.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":157.02},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":161.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":168.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":174.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":180.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":188.53},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":195.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":202.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.87},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.87},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.53},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.48},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.69},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50.87,"local_amount":135.64,"processed_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:38Z","rounded_local_amount":136.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142542},{"amount":51.87,"local_amount":138.34,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":139.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271131},{"amount":55.53,"local_amount":148.08,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":149.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993784},{"amount":56.04,"local_amount":149.42,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":150.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601688},{"amount":58.88,"local_amount":157.02,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":158.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287221903},{"amount":291.12,"local_amount":776.33,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":783.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294297986},{"amount":185.69,"local_amount":495.17,"processed_date":"2013-05-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":499.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483455}],"funded_date":"2012-01-21T09:11:59Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:47:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacqueline Demeranville","image":1016015}},{"id":379618,"name":"Otilia Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La joven se\u00f1ora Otilia tiene 22 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera de 1 hijo y se dedica al comercio, su actividad principal es la venta Baleadas (Tortillas de harina con frijoles, huevo, mantequilla, queso y carne) su negocio esta ubicado en un punto muy estrat\u00e9gico, por ese sector transitan muchas personas que se dirigen a los centros educativos y centros de trabajo, ahora en estos momentos sus clientes se han triplicado y no logra cubrir con todas las exigencias de sus clientes.\nOtilia utilizara el credito para la compra de alimentos para la preparacion de sus sabrosas baleadas.\nlas ganancias las necesita para salir adelante con su hijo.\n","en":"Otilia, 22, is a young single mother of 1 son, is a businesswoman who sells \"baleadas\" (flour tortillas with beans, eggs, butter, cheese and meat).

Charles is a friendly member of the community with 5 children. Charles lives with his family in a house made of mud walls, dirt floor, and iron roof.\n\nNyamanga B village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from the local spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Charles\u2019 family and the 35 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nCharles has volunteered to be the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Charles volunteered to be the promoter because he wants to help the community to treat water and prevent water-borne diseases. There are also four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Joseph, Benard, Ladislaus and Alfred.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Charles\u2019 community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1805251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To allow the community to treat their water to make it safe to drink using chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ladislaus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfred ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":913113,"name":"Munyaradzi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Munyaradzi lives in Chitungwiza and has 2 children, aged 3 and 5.

","en":"Zuhro S. was born in 1985. She does not have a university degree. She is married with 2 children and up to now, she has been a stay-at-home mom. From time to time she was helping her mother sell children's clothing at the market. Now, when the children are no longer little, her mother  helped her start her business, also by sharing goods. In the beginning, Zuhro found it quite scary to sell at the market; her husband did not approve of this occupation either. However, with time he changed his mind and she also learned how to sell. It is Zuhro's mother who advised her to apply for a Microinvest loan. Zukhro used the loan for the puchase of children's clothing.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Oksana Buranbaeva, Kiva

She has a small business selling clothing and has been in business for thirteen years. She is an energetic, enthusiastic entrepreneur who operates her business simply but wisely. An example of this is times when she has needed to purchase new clothing inventory. Rather than close her business and travel herself to buy inventory, she has paid other clothing vendors to buy for her so that she can stay and keep her business open.\r\n\r\nTaskirya has requested a loan to help renew her supply of clothing. This loan will help her purchase a good supply of inventory so she can maximize her profits and continue working to develop her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: buying and selling Avon products and herbal medicine. Her husband Ernesto who is 66 years old, retired from work and helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are 35 to 42 years old. Leticia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Leticia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000, to purchase more products to sell so that she can continue to save up for future daily needs and house repair. Leticia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Aside from this source of income he also spends his time offering public transport with the help of his bus.

This loan of $100 will be his first from GHAPE, one of Kiva's field partners, and will be used to purchase kerosene, oil, Maggi (a popular seasoning in Cameroon), plantain stems for planting and labor to assist in clearing his farmland.  \r\n\r\nBecause there is a constant demand for the household products Paul sells, as well as the convenient location of his store, he believes his business will succeed.  In addition, Paul is helping the community by purchasing the plantain stems from fellow neighbors.  \r\n\r\nAll three of his children are under the age of fifteen, so the profits of his business will go toward his children's school fees and to expand his farming business.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Juliana Haine  has 1 year of experience in this business.  Juliana Haine  needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  Juliana is joining the program to request a fund for developing her business for the sake of her family financially.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Juliana Haine  joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Juliana Haine 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Juliana Haine  T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Albertine lives with her husband and children in the Abokicodji neighborhood of Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  She has lived in this neighborhood for about twelve years.  The couple shares the different family responsibilities.  \r\n\r\nAlbertine did not go to school.  For the last twelve years, she has been preparing and selling \u201cakassa\u201d (a local food made of cornstarch) at her home.  Albertine buys corn in Dantokpa, the international market of Benin.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

(age 52) has been widowed since 1997.  She lives in a small village across the Mekong River about fifteen kilometers north of Phnom Penh.  She shares her one-room house wI. three of her children, one son-in-law and one grandson.   Though Thorn learned to weave from her mother many years ago, she\u2019s been working at it commercially for only about seven or eight years.  She has also taught her daughter, now age twenty-one, (see photo) who joined on a second loom.  They both laughed that the daughter is now the better weaver because her eyes are better than her mother\u2019s.  <P>\r\n\r\nThorn is requesting this, her third loan from MAXIMA, in the amount of $300. She will use the funds from the loan to buy materials for weaving.  Prior to taking out a loan, Thorn worked on a barter basis wI. a local middleperson.  The middleperson would advance her an amount of weaving thread.  Out of that thread, Thorn would give back two finished pieces and get the profit only from one.

Thus far, she has obtained two loans of $40 and $300 respectively and the repayment was satisfactory.  The loans accomplished many things, such as paying school fees for her children and grandchildren, supporting the health of her family and feeding the family.\r\n\r\nGiven this loan, Grace plans to construct a new pig pen, electrify the pig pen to give light to the pigs when they are about to deliver at night. She also plans to buy 10 piglets to add to the ones she already has, to prepare a packing space for her firewood, and to continue buying and splitting of wood. She promises to start repayment at the fourth month from the date of disbursement.  \r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan, she plans to expand her business, continue to pay school fees for her children and grandchildren, and take care of the health and feeding in the family.\r\n\r\nGrace prefers a loan from GHAPE because the means  of repayment is easier, the loan scheme is encouraging, the interest paid on GHAPE loans is relatively low as compared to other financial institution, and lastly, GHAPE does proper follow up with their clients to ensure the loan is manage judiciously."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":177366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials for new pig pen, and piglets and firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntahsen Market Square, NW.

After the recovery, Leontine decided to change the business because of a broken finger that she got from the accident.  She opened a general boutique in late 2005 and has been operating this business to the present day. She sells soaps, sugar, salt, milk, toilet papers, oil, cans, and other household goods. Her business strategies are based on the high quality of goods, strategic pricing, caring for clients and never running out of inventory.

Mr. Sambath B. is the 40 year old village bank president. He is a farmer who owns a plot of land where he cultivates rice to earn a living. In this plantation, he faces an obstacle because his field is infertile and this is badly affecting his crop. In order to solve this problem, he decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer and he will use the rest of the loan to purchase fuel to pump water to support the field and make his crop more productive. His wife, Mrs. Keo Phanith, is a housewife who is a good cooker and a good mother. Mr. Sambath B. has seven children, one of whom is a construction worker, while another two are waiters in the restaurant, three others are enrolled in the local school, and the youngest one is too young to work or study.    \r\n\r\nFive members in this group loan are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Those with end-of-term loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

They are blessed with nine children of whom four are still studying and the rest are now working. Her husband is doing manual labor jobs and at the same time is engaged in farming. With this situation, it has been so hard for her to raise their big family. She decided to engage in fish selling and was able to sustain this business for three years, even in times of hardships. She joined Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) a year ago because she is very much interested in PMPC's various products and services. Having successfully repaid two previous loans, she was able to borrow an amount of 7,000 Philippine pesos for her third loan to obtain needed capital for her business. Her dream in life is to be able to send all her children to college so that they will have a better future and be able to improve their living

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,450,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase piglets to raise and sell.\r\n\r\nH. is now requesting a new loan of 6,322,000 VND which will again be used to purchase piglets to raise and sell.

By working hard in her general store, electronic reloading and rice retailing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 13,000.\r\n\r\nDelia S. is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can continue to sustain the growth of her general store, electronic reloading and rice retailing businesses. This will be her seventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Delia S. hopes to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

As a single mother, she is characterized by being a responsible and very dedicated person who takes good care of her 2 children, Roc\u00edo and Anderson, whom she loves very much. As a hard-working and persistent woman, every morning she works in her fields growing peas, spinach and carrots, which she cares for with great dedication and effort. Over the course of time she was able to acquire her own agricultural lands. With the current demand for vegetables in the city's market, she also needed to rent other lands to plant in greater quantities. Parallel to this activity, she works buying and selling vegetables in the country's capital, where she has been traveling for the past 12 years. Her work consists of buying various kinds of vegetables and produce, which she combines with her own harvest. She sells them at the market in the capital called \"La Parada,\" where, as she mentions in her own words, she \"is finished selling in 2 hours.\" Now she has planted spinach, which she will harvest within a week. Her business is going very well for her, and her aspirations are great: she would like to open a store selling compost and fertilizers in her town, where most of the inhabitants are farmers. She belongs to the \u201cVirgen Mar\u00eda\u201d communal bank. This is her sixth loan with MFP, and she is grateful for this support, since it helps her keep advancing toward her goals.
