has recently decided to change her business enterprise from charcoal sales to fish vending. She has been in this new business for a few months. She works in the very market where she used to sell charcoal. She buys fish from the Gaba landing site in Makindye Division in Kampala District. Her primary business challenge is the transport of fish from Gaba to her stall in Owino market, a journey for which she presently uses public transportation. She works six days a week. She wants to use this loan to buy more baskets of fish. She aspires toward a business model of selling solely at wholesale prices. She decided to work with MCDT because she wanted to boost her business by obtaining additional capital. \r\n\r\nHawa resides in a rented two-roomed house and the family has access to electricity and piped water. Her monthly expenses include school fees, food, and rent. She is a single mother and has three children, all of whom attend school. She lives in Mengo Kisenyi in the outskirts of Kampala city.

Kabac, Bantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: pig fattening, buying and selling of charcoal, and buying and selling of beverages, rice, and eggs.  Her husband Pedro D., who is 51 years old, works as a Seaman to earn his living. They have three children whose ages range from 20 to 29 years old. \r\n\r\nAnnie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Annie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she could continue to save up for the future by putting up a new business.  Annie is hoping to get into the fishing business, for which she needs to purchase fishing materials and a pump boat. Annie D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Cansalongan, Isabella, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a rice mill and a general store. Her husband Hernani, who is 60 years old, works as a driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 28 and 29 years old. \r\n\r\nMehujayme joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mehujayme has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for the rice mill and to purchase stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs . Mehujayme P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  farming and buying & selling dried fish. Her husband Samuel C., who is 51 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 14 and  23 years old. \r\n\r\nElena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow, making an income from the sales of products from her farm. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy fertilizers such as manure so that she can continue to save up for future improvement of business. Elena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

others. Sonia is a community partner of CCT* in Pasay City. She has no family of her own; nevertheless, her siblings and friends consider themselves blessed because of her. Sonia reached college and is now dedicated to making her business reach new heights.\r\n\r\nSonia rents out the rooms in her house to boarders \u2013 students, working professionals and transients.  She has been in this business for 12 years now; so, she has quite a good grasp of managing rooms well and keeping a good, relaxing ambiance in the house. As well, her personality jives with the different individual clients she gets to meet. Monthly she is able to earn 12,000 Philippine pesos (PHP).\r\n\r\nBecause she is taking her business to new heights, Sonia decided to borrow 25,000 PHP. This is a great help to her business, as she needs the money to buy additional materials, such as metal, cement and other construction materials, to improve the room facilities. She really wants to make the rooms look better and to add more to accommodate more clients. Because the loan enables her to shape up her business, she is also able to give financially to siblings who do not have work.\r\n\r\nAt present, Sonia battles a health problem, as her stomach frequently hurts. Her head also aches with clients who do not pay their dues on time; sometimes, not at all! Still, these are not enough to stop Sonia from reaching new business heights. She desires to level up her rental services from rooms to a condominium. She plans on buying her own lot and building another house. She dreams of having her own car. Of course, she also has a dream for her siblings. Simple as she is, she wants to be of assistance to them and to others even in the years to come.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\nWith income from maize sales, Ronald will educate his children, ensure food security and invest in livestock rearing.\r\nIn 2012, the members of Tafuta OAF Group will each plant  between half and one acre of maize.\r\nIn the photograph, Ronald is pictured with his group members, and his field officer on the far left.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":887834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-10-11T11:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bonface","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dennis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenetrix","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oscar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phillip","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ronald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tiberius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":85400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":850,"local_amount":85400,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:01Z","rounded_local_amount":86275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680465}],"funded_date":"2011-10-18T09:53:06Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":347283,"name":"Nilo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Nilo, 41, resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She is in her 13th credit loan cycle, is 50 years old and the mother of eight children, of whom three study in an auto mechanics training centre, two in the standard school system, two stay in the village and work in the fields, and one does not attend school. Her husband runs a small business.\r\n\r\nShe began her own business with funds received from her husband. With this starting capital she purchased a container of palm oil worth $12.\r\n\r\nHer business is retailing palm oil at the central market in Virunga, which she has done for the past eight years. With the loan from the Hekima MFI Mwadji M. wants to increase her turnover by purchasing 24 containers of palm oil and 30 pairs of plastic sandals. She also sells plastic sandals locally called \u201cbodaboda\u201d or \u201csoza\u201d to increase her income.\r\n\r\nFor the future, she plans to change activities and go into general commerce, getting her supplies from Kampala in Uganda. Eventually, she wants to build a comfortable home.\r\n\r\nMwadji M. thanks the Hekima MFI for the loans she has received although she had no collateral, because they enabled her to meet her children\u2019s needs. What\u2019s more, she was separated for quite some time from her children due to the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and the Hekima loans allowed her to pay for her children\u2019s plane fare from Buyimayi to Goma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4900,"image":{"id":520756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"24 containers of palm oil and 30 pairs of plastic sandals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

She tells us that she wants to buy clothes a little softer, which are being asked for more.  That way she will increase her sales and satisfy all of her customers. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She earns her living by operating one business venture: a Ready-to-Wear business.  She has three children who are 24 to 30 years old. \r\n\r\nRodelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rodelia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future. \r\n\r\nRodelia G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives at home with her family in the District of Pimentel, which is approximately twenty minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.  This small urban community has experienced recent growth.\r\n<p>\r\nFor the past year, Maria has been selling food. Her aunt offered her a small space in front of her house which she turned into a makeshift diner.  During the early hours, Maria goes to the wholesale markets in Moshoqueque and Modelo to buy the supplies for preparing <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ceviche\" target=\"_blank\" >ceviches<\/a> and other Peruvian dishes.  Her main customers are doctors and other hospital staff who work nearby.  She also serves students who attend the two universities in her community.  \r\n<p>\r\nAt the moment, Maria only has three tables and a few wooden and plastic chairs.  She wants to expand her facilities by purchasing more tables and chairs.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 800 PEN.  Her greatest wish is to open a tourist restaurant.  She is grateful to Kiva lenders for supporting the growth of her business.

On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

She has been seperated form her husband for 16 years, which is why she was forced to work in a factory, welding steel tools. Nevertheless, she has to abandon this after ten years of hard work due to an accident. She recalls that she was doing her daily work when suddenly a big tool fell on top of her. The doctor said she could not return to work after that. This was reason enough for her to immediately look for another way to earn a living. So she began making clothing with the little knowledge she had about dressmaking. But, at the same time, she took a course about how to prepare fertilizer and plant flowerpots. This is why she know works selling clothing and also plants. What she would like most is to buy the machines needed to improve the way she makes clothes, since she can\u2019t currently achieve a good finish on her garments and their low quality leads to a low selling price.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients present a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in a relatives' home and what she most desires is to improve her quality of life.  She has a sales stall in the San Jos\u00e9 market (an important market in the city of Juliaca).  She sells artisanal weavings which she makes herself in her workshop.  This is why her items are unique and her customers can't find them anywhere else.  What she likes most about her work is being able to chat with her fellow merchants.  She has had this occupation for 7 years and believes that the most difficult part of it is moving the bundles of woven goods from her workshop to her sales stand.  Her future plans are to have a larger store where she can sell her wares more comfortably.  This is Cecilia's first loan with MFP.  She expects to make her repayments on time.  She is a very active member of her communal bank and always participates in all the meetings.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: pig fattening, dealer of Avon, Natasha and Sara Lee, and a fishing business.  Her husband, Igil, who is 43 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are 7 to 18 years old. \r\n\r\nFlordeliz joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1991 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 22 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Flordeliz has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $127, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 23rd cycle loan, she is borrowing 19,500 PHP which she intends to use to purchase fishing gear and more pigs so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Flordeliz S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She lives with her parents and her four siblings, whom she helps with their studies and with some of the difficulties they have which are typical of their age.  \r\n\r\nGraciela makes a living selling meals.

Graciela has only been in business for three months; she previously had a bodega, but she had to change her economic activity because it was not bringing in much profit.

She is now very happy, since her work is easier with all of their help.  She currently serves an average of 30 pre-ordered meals per day, and prepares about 20 more meals as backup.  Graciela would like to set up a restaurant eventually, which would allow her to continue working with her family and to improve their lives together.  This will be her first loan with MFP, and she hopes that working with the organization will help her continue toward her goals.  She promises to be a responsible customer and is very happy to belong to her communal bank, since the other members bring much confidence and solidarity.  Graciela will use the amount she is asking for, 2000 soles, to purchase materials, ingredients, and supplies so that she can continue with her work, since demand has increased and she wants to meet all of her customers\u2019 needs. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":939076,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase ingredients for preparing meals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-08T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":310.12},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":302.91},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":330.27},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":342.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":348.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":365.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.3},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.85},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.47},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.3,"local_amount":310.12,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":313.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836288},{"amount":113.59,"local_amount":302.91,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":306.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246049},{"amount":123.85,"local_amount":330.27,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:02Z","rounded_local_amount":334.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386069},{"amount":128.47,"local_amount":342.59,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":346.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099158},{"amount":130.71,"local_amount":348.57,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":352.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713313},{"amount":137.08,"local_amount":365.54,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":369.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202194}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T14:24:34Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":376005,"name":"Nemie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nemie is 45 years old, and married with six children.

For Asteria it is very difficult (like for any mother) to be apart from her children, and to not see them daily.\r\nWith the money that she will get from the loan she would like to expand her business so that later on she can open a medical practice with her husband. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Samantha Cereceda, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":198980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To increase the amount and variety  of the medicines that she sells, and in the future open a medical practice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-09-11T21:40:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asteria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-25T21:44:18Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":133.82,"processed_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-28T07:55:45Z","rounded_local_amount":135.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372183},{"amount":45.66,"local_amount":132.84,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":134.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335876},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":134.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957054},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:11:39Z","rounded_local_amount":134.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227304},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":134.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422543},{"amount":45.85,"local_amount":133.35,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:24Z","rounded_local_amount":134.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27115767}],"funded_date":"2008-09-11T21:44:18Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Samantha Cereceda","image":null}},{"id":67835,"name":"Mrs. Phum Pheng's Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Phum P.'s Village Bank has 14 members and each will use their loan for different purposes.

The art of embroidery has always attracted her ever since she was a child. She got the opportunity to work in embroidery four years ago when she met her best friend who taught her how to do it. Her friend encouraged her to embroider clothes for export as they always have a large number of orders to complete. Since then, she has been working every day from her home where she feels comfortable close to her beloved family. The difficult part of her work is to complete the large number of clothing orders since it is very tiring for her hand to maintain the constant rhythm. Gladys hopes in the future to have her own embroidery workshop where machines can help her produce a larger quantity of clothing. Four years ago she started working with Kiva partner MFP and is very happy to be part of such a nice group and to be working alongside her friends. The money she is asking for will be used to buy a larger quantity of supplies such as thread and material for her embroidery.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":280014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy embroidery supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-04T16:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":415}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117207},{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012118},{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595703},{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989966},{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:55Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211097},{"amount":128.65,"local_amount":415,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":420.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640599}],"funded_date":"2009-03-04T22:50:14Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:25:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":96509,"name":"Mom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mom S. is 24 years old and resides in the Kampong Cham province with her husband and two of her children.

When a friend invited her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000, she was very apprehensive because she did not want to be in debt, but she was determined to help her family, so with the agreement of her husband, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon and with her first loan she started a small general store and to make sure that she could pay back her loan she went around her community selling specialty goods house to house. The business nets around PHP1,600.00 ($33) per month, but is able to feed her family.\r\n\r\nShe has used subsequent loans to slowly but steadily build her business. Now on her 11th loan cycle, the PHP 15,000 she is borrowing will allow her to widen the variety of goods that she could sell in her store.

Shahnoza is 22-years old, married and the loving mother of three children. She works purchasing and reselling cows with her husband. She would like to request a loan of $800 USD in order to purchase additional cows to increase her inventory and meet customer demands. Shahnoza believes this will lead to greater revenue and, ultimately, greater profit for her family. In the future, she would like to reinvest the earnings generated by this loan back into her business in order to purchase additional cows and increase their income further.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her family in her own house.  What she wishes for the most is to give them a good quality of life.\r\n\r\nAna\u2019s stall for selling shoes is located in the Laguna Temporal plaza (place where there are fairs in the city of Juliaca).  But, she does not just sell shoes.  She also makes them.  She is very good at her work, which is why she also distributes her footwear to other sellers.  What she likes the most about her work is making shoes, which she does with much effort.  She has been doing this for 11 years.  The most difficult part is transporting the shoes to the sales locations because she has to go to many locations.\r\n\r\nIn the future she hopes to have a very large store where she can sell the shoes she makes.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  She has paid her previous loans punctually.  She expects to pay this last one on time as well.  She is very active in her community bank.  She will use the 2,000 PEN that she is asking for to buy new materials to make a larger quantity of shoes.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":379585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Buy materials for making shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-29T19:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":344.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081289},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":344.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997440},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":344.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842785},{"amount":350.35,"local_amount":1001,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1037.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734362}],"funded_date":"2009-08-29T20:58:39Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":137520,"name":"Joy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joy is 36 years old and married with two children.

and female members dedicated to their respective small businesses. The members sell items such as used clothing, cosmetics, lingerie, perfumes, toys, and hair accessories.\r\n\r\nThe members of \u201cEl Progreso\u201d are from Linares, a city in the Maule region of central Chile. Linares is a city of vibrant commercial activity and has developed as an important center of exports, particularly because of their wine production. Nevertheless, the region is one of the poorest in Chile.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be invested in merchandise by the \u201cEl Progreso\u201d group, in order to increase their supplies and earnings.\r\n\r\nMarcela, a representative of the group, is pictured in the front row in a black athletic suit with a fuchsia colored T-shirt. She sells underwear and socks for men, and like the other members of the group, she sells them from a stall on one of the main streets in the city of Linares. These stalls are free to use, as they have been constructed by the government for the use of small business owners.\r\n\r\nMarcela\u2019s dream is to achieve economic stability for her family and to continue funding her children\u2019s education, while also caring for her two-year-old nephew.\r\n\r\nFor Marcela, Fondo Esperanza has been the motivating force behind her business\u2019s growth because, before the loans, Marcela never had the funding to grow her business. Also, Marcela believes she has benefitted greatly from the training courses that are taught at their weekly communal bank meetings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":463624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more merchandise for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Linares","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2010-01-05T01:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tamara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eradie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arlette ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gaspar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1056702,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":73705},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":74192},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":74677},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":75169},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":56467},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76032},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":76530},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":77034},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":77539},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":78045},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78552},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":79070},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":79590},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":80100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.48},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.4},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.39},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.22},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.1},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.1},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1049.66,"local_amount":528182,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":532652.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118072565},{"amount":419.74,"local_amount":211208,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":212995.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128944196},{"amount":630.6,"local_amount":317312,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":319997.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136672653}],"funded_date":"2010-01-06T00:31:46Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":170545,"name":"Jairo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jairo habita en el municipio del Coral,  tiene un a\u00f1o de laborar como responsable de Planificaci\u00f2n  de la Alcaldia del Coral Chontales, este joven esta felizmente casado tiene dos hijos menores de edad, su esposa  cuida de sus hijos y de los quehaceres del Hogar, esta solicitando su primer cr\u00e9dito a la instituci\u00f3n de AFODENIC para ser invertido en mejora de su vivienda, poniendo el piso de su casa y reparando una parte que se encuentra da\u00f1ada.

They have a child who is five years old. Luna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she wanted to improve her family's life. With the help of six previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luna has been slowly lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. She has applied for a seventh loan, for PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to stock her clothing store. Her long-term goals are to expand her business and repair her house. Luna E. is a Dungganon (or honorable) woman who is following an honest path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable).

She earns her living by operating a tricycle transport business and a repair\/welding shop.  Her husband Romeo, who is 58 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are between 22 and 40 years old.  Nancy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nancy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy tools and materials in order to reinforce her business operations and further develop it.  Nancy is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has a 3-year-old daughter and a 10-month-old son.  In search of a source of income for her family, Kanymbu decided to launch her own food sale and catering business.  The shop in which Kanymbu works also serves as a dining room.  One can have a bite to eat and buy the necessary food products.  Kanymbu has worked very hard to develop her business and has been very successful:  her business now brings in close to 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  Today, Kanymbu doesn't have a wide range of food items.  This is why she has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners and requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS).  This loan will allow her to buy a broader range of merchandise, attract a larger number of customers and increase her sales.\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":979685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a broader variety of food products.

Her husband is a fisherman so he is frequently away from home.  The work off-shore requires the fisherman to be away for a whole month each trip.  During these trips, Mrs. H. stays at home to brew rice wine and sell fishes at the local market.  Her sources come from her husband as well as other fishermen.  Even though life is still hard, it has been much better than how it used to be prior to joining TYM.  Now, they have an additional source of funds to buy fishing equipments and increase the efficiency. The average income is about 200 USD per month for each of them.  They also have 5 children, 2 of which are still going to school.  Mrs. H. would like to take out a loan of 325 USD to buy new fishing-net and more rice to brew wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Anh Hoai Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb L\u00ea Th\u1ecb H., 46 tu\u1ed5i \u0111\u00e3 v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c 4 n\u0103m.

She is 30 years old. Mary Fe is single and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Mary Fe owns and operates a sari-sari, or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling frequently-used retail products in the local community. Mary Fe has been engaged in her business for more than 6 years and earns approximately 1500 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2008, Mary Fe joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mary Fe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Mary Fe is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Mary Fe from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 23 years old. Remelyn is married and has an infant child. To make a living, Remelyn owns & operates a store where she sells daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Remelyn has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Remelyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Remelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Remelyn is requesting a new loan of 55,000 PHP, which will be used to fully pay for a transport vehicle to improve her business. She will also use the loan as additional capital for her mini grocery store. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Remelyn from PMPC and the second loan funded by Kiva. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The idea of having this kind of business crossed her mind when her husband who is also fisherman caught more fish in the lake, located in Talim Island, in the province of Rizal. Liwanag sold those in their neighborhood and she realized that selling fish earns profits bigger and faster than any other kind of business she had had in the past years of her life using her loan from ASHI. Unlike other products sold, fish is salable because it is one of the most basic needs of the human being, especially for people who live in very remote areas of the province. They are far from the municipal market thus the possibility of buying from vendors who come to their community is very high. Also, most people choose to buy fish rather than any other meat because it is cheaper and healthier.\r\n\r\nFrom then on, Liwanag used her loans from ASHI in her fishing business. From the profits she earned, she was able to invest in her home and support her family financially, specially the tuition fees of her five children which are very expensive. \r\n\r\nShe kept on borrowing from ASHI to keep her business growing. Now, she plans to use her newly received loan in buying additional materials needed for her fishing business such as fishing nets and other supplies so that her husband will catch more fish to sell. If ever the couple gets better output, they will be able to invest more in their home.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dreams are for her four younger children to attain a degree, just like her eldest child, Raynan, who graduated from computer courses and has a successful job with the coastguard. Education is wealth that other people can\u2019t steal. The couple believes that education is the only inheritance they can offer their children. To make this happen, they help each other in order for them to achieve their dreams of giving their children the best in life.

I launched my business 15 years ago, with a capital of Q.500.00. As time went by I started to get new clients and I am now selling in different towns and villages where I offer my products on the streets. About 6 years ago, my sister introduced the idea of also selling beauty products through catalogs. Since I already had a good number of clients, the products we well received.<p>\r\n\r\nThanks to the Lord people have been ordering clothing and beauty products, therefore I am in need of more capital to be able to fulfill their orders. Now that everything has gone up in price one needs to invest more in the merchandise, especially if one wants to have the items clients request readily available. My goal with this loan is to be able to take advantage of the season, in which people request large orders, due to the town celebrations that are soon to come. <p>\r\n\r\nI always work hard to get ahead and take good care of my two children, especially now that I don't live with my husband. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Libertad Leal, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoy AnaDela B.

She is 39 years old. Florentina is the group leader for an eight-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Florentina C.'s Group.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFlorentina is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Florentina owns and operates a business raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Florentina has been engaged in her business for over 27 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Florentina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Florentina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Florentina is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young plants to raise. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Florentina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He is married and has four children who are all adults living independent lives. He has seven additional dependents, who live with him because they are his relatives and he is the eldest in his family.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Gibril established a cinema, sports, and games business. He began his business after he retired from his job. He started this business because he needed to find a new way of earning a living.  Working 3 days a week and 4 hours a day, he earns about 1,248,000 Sierra Leonean leones (SLL) every month from this business. He would like a loan 3,000,000 SLL.

Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to buy feed and vaccines for her pigs so that she could continue to save up for future home repairs and the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAilliene N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).
