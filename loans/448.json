Son mari retrait\u00e9 qui per\u00e7oit difficilement ses pensions, n\u2019arrive plus \u00e0 assumer financi\u00e8rement ses responsabilit\u00e9s. Couturi\u00e8re de profession, elle se bat pour satisfaire la famille avec le peu qu\u2019elle gagne. Malgr\u00e9 cette condition de vie tr\u00e8s mis\u00e9rable, elle n\u2019a jamais recul\u00e9 devant ses responsabilit\u00e9. Ainsi, pour mieux accomplir cette mission, elle voudrait acheter une nouvelle machine pour renforcer sa couture et ajouter \u00e0 ce m\u00e9tier la vente de tissus pagnes et autres produits dans le but de diversifier ses sources de revenu. N'ayant pas les moyens pour r\u00e9aliser ce projet, elle vient solliciter un cr\u00e9dit de $800. Pour l\u2019\u00e9panouissement de sa famille, elle a besoin de soutien pour atteindre son objectif.

Marie was born in 1971 in Benin. She currently lives with her three children in Lome, in the neighborhood Tokoin Lycee. She is a retailer of basic goods and necessities though she also has a general grocery store. A single mother, she is the sole provider for her children, but because their needs take priority, she often lacks the funds necessary to stock and supply her grocery store, which means she sometimes loses customers. She is asking for a loan of $400 to expand her business. With the loan, she will stock her store with sacks of rice, oil and other goods, because it will soon be time for the end-of-the-year festivals. This will allow her to increase her earnings, directly profiting her children and giving them a better future.  \r\n\r\n<p>Translated from French by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\nVeuve S.

She is widowed and a mother of four children: a boy and three daughters. She says one of her daughters is married. Of the remaining three, one is at the teacher training college, one is in the junior high and another is in the senior high school. Francesca lost her husband not long ago; that\u2019s why she is in dark colours. In our part of the world as done elsewhere, dark colours are worn when one is bereaved. She lives with her children in a rented apartment in Berekum in the Brong Ahafo region. Berekum is a busy business centre which is about twenty-five minutes drive from Sunyani, the regional capital. <p>\r\n\r\nFrancesca deals in printed textile fabrics.

She has eight children, four of whom are in school while the other four have their own families. Her husband is a carpenter.  \r\n<p>\r\nElsie used to bake bread just for her family's snacks. She knew how to bake because she used to be the \u201calalay\u201d  (helper) of her mother, using a native \"pugon\" (oven). When some of her neighbors who had tasted her bread encouraged her to bake more and sell it to them, she grabbed the opportunity. Now she continues her bread-making business, and it turns out to be profitable. In order to have additional capital, she joined the Kiva field partner, Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative, to take out a loan. \r\n<p>\r\nAs a member in good standing, she is already on her 10th loan cycle. Now she is applying for a loan of $825 to buy flour and other ingredients for making bread, and to buy sacks of rice for her new business, which is selling rice. She plans to have mixing equipment someday and to expand her business into a bakery.

Q. is an active member of the El Para\u00edso Communal Bank, which is located in the Cumbe parrish in the outskirts of the city of Cuenca.  Ana lives in the Los Olivos area, which is 15 minutes from the Cumbe parrish.  She is 40 and in a common law marriage.  She has two children, 17 and 9.  Her older son goes to the T\u00e9cnico Cumb School.  Her younger son goes to the Gabriel Arseminio Villauri School in the area.  Her house is her own, made with various years of effort in her youth.  Her husband transports gas.  They help each other economically, forming a good family cornerstone.\r\n\r\nAna has had a grocery store for ten years.  Her business is going very well.  Her work hours are from six in the morning until ten at night every day, without closing on Sundays.  She tells us that the advantage of working in your own business is that you are not subjected to a strict schedule, and nobody gives you orders.  When you have something else to do, you close the business.  The disadvantage is having little money to stock the store.\r\n\r\nShe has been working with the bank for ten cycles.  She remembers when they started and there were only six members.  Now, there are 19.  She hopes that more members join to keep growing.  Her business has benefited from the loans.  She also likes it because they guarantee them between colleagues, and they do not need to do much paperwork.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from the loan she is asking for to buy merchandise to better stock her store and have adequate stock to offer her customers.\r\n\r\nAna\u2019s goal is to have a mini supermarket with telephone booths and a stationery store.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":388243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy merchandise to better stock her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-09-15T16:10:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Maruja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.7,"local_amount":183.7,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:47:01Z","rounded_local_amount":183.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035203},{"amount":91.31,"local_amount":91.31,"processed_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":91.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947457},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947458},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789310},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789311},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679729},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679730},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679731},{"amount":274.97,"local_amount":274.97,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":274.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074333}],"funded_date":"2009-09-17T14:50:12Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":141290,"name":"Florish Sister Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florish Sister is a group of five borrowers led by Sylvestine W., who is 31 years old and married.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":578287,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

She works in the repair and re-upholstering of sofas, some of which she buys in poor condition and then repairs to cell them later at a better price.  She also re-upholsters sofas at the request of particular clients.  Luz has been working in this job for 17 years directly from her house, as she has added space in her patio to do her work. She usually goes to pick up old sofas in a small car to move them to her house for repair, but she no longer has access to this vehicle. Luz also makes curtains and cushions.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she will buy fabric, leather, and imitation leather in the cities of Santiago and San Fernando.  In this way, she will increase her production and her earnings.  She lives with her husband and their three children, who also help her with her business.  Her husband helps her when he has time off from his work as a craftsman of mimbre (a flexible type of shrub wood). Luz's dream is to purchase machinery to sew leather and an electric stapler, as she currently does the interior stitching on the sofas manually, which is causing her health problems.

T. (12) is a 38-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Hoa.  Thanh is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 05.01.12 Bac Hai - H. Phong - H. Hoa.\n\nThanh is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, Thanh operates a family member's business venture in the services sector operating a service: help local people to make rice ready for cook (local people bring their rice to Ms. Thanh house and Ms. Thanh uses machine to make it clean and ready for cook).  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general services to local community members.  Thanh has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2005, Thanh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Thanh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000,000 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase equipment to improve the business.  She is now requesting a new loan of 7,000,000 VND, which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the 7th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Thanh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions for her family.\n\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\n\n1.  Bich P. T.

In regards to her economic activity, Julia had a business knitting sweaters and her first loans were for buying wool. For a year she has had a business sewing jackets. The change was due to the fact that one of her children learned to sew jackets abroad. When her son came home, he proposed starting the business sewing jackets and she agreed. In addition to sewing jackets, Julia trades in potatoes, beans and peas. This business requires Julia to travel to the markets in the countryside where she buys the products and brings them to sell in the city of El Alto.\r\n\r\nThe loan this cycle is to buy fabric for the jackets and potatoes, beans and peas. \r\n\r\nThe way of working allows her to generate resources to support her four children as much as possible (aged 27, 25, 22 and 20) as well as to take care of herself, since she is single. \r\n  \r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she liked that she was given the chance to receive a loan withe the supportive co-sign. \"It's an easy loan\" she said.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":729969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, potatoes, beans and peas.

My children depend on my business, which thankfully allows me to provide them food and education.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carrie Ting, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":239990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"For the purchase of plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2008-12-21T07:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isai","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14884172},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20433617},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27127951},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:06:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36024747},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44610652},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:44:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53007450},{"amount":175,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3345.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73661299},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":5000.01,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-17T10:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5018.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87101331},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1666.63,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T05:42:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97018375}],"funded_date":"2008-12-25T16:43:37Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T05:42:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carolyn Ting","image":653228}},{"id":83897,"name":"Mwanaidi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Tanzania!

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":255828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of rice, sugar, cooking oil, and soda.

M. is a 28-year old young woman who lives with her husband and two children in a community called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, in the the province of Cartago. It is a small rural community with a population of approximately 2,000. The local people are milk and coffee producers. The area is hilly and much of the land is tropical rainforest. It\u2019s very attractive with two lovely lakes, coffee plantations, and dairies mixed in with the rainforest.\r\n\r\nIn the last little while Grettel has wanted to develop her small dairy business with a project involving milk products such as cream and cheese. She says that she is very pleased with the business because it's built her confidence and served as a source of income for improving her life despite the problems that the community faces.\r\n\r\nCurrently Grettel needs a loan of 500,000 colones with which to buy a cow. This will enable her to increase milk production and other dairy products which are sure to be in great demand in the community since they are of high quality.\r\n\r\nSra. Grettel is a member of the Producers\u2019 Association of El Sauce, one of the hundred member organisations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be her second loan and she hopes that it will enable her to continue developing both on a personal and on an economic level.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

She earns her living by operating a fish vending business.  \r\n\r\nAurelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Aurelia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus raising her family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 6th cycle loan, Aurelia is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her business in order to continue to save up for future renovations of her house. Aurelia R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  shell handicrafts and an Avon dealership. Her husband, Celestino I. who is 52 years old, works as a woodcarver. They have 5 children who are 13 to 24 years old. \r\n\r\nGumercinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 2 cycle loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gumercinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 6,000 helped increase her monthly profit to PHP 20,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 3rd cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more materials for her shell handicraft business. She can then continue to save for the future, expand her business and become an exporter of shell handicrafts. Gumercinda I. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She looks after the youngest child only, as the eldest already works and earns a living. Together they strive to get ahead every day. The days of this enterprising woman are peaceful, because she manages a store installed in her own home. Four years ago she decided to start a business that would allow her to make a profit and also care for her children. That's why she opened the store, where she not only sells food, but also decorative and household items. The store is well liked by her neighbours, who buy because of the good prices of the merchandise. She loves her work because it is quiet and she enjoys talking to her neighbours when she is selling to them. \r\n\r\nShe always thinks about the future and she already has plans to expand her store in order to offer the best to her customers and make progress.

Her business is located in the city suburbs were there are many carpentry workshops.\r\nThis seemingly hard working lady is optimistic that if she adds more capital to her business it will enable her pay school fees for her children and, in future, construct rental units."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":65732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increasing stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Wandegeya - Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":37,"posted_date":"2007-09-14T21:25:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rachael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-29T00:16:51Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-10-29T10:18:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-29T10:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73539},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-11-29T10:20:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-29T10:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88393},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-12-29T10:17:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-29T10:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":104518},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2008-01-29T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-29T10:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123824},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-29T10:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144912},{"amount":130,"local_amount":130,"processed_date":"2008-03-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-29T10:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":130,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":168513}],"funded_date":"2007-09-15T00:16:51Z","paid_date":"2008-03-29T10:05:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":22450,"name":"Anani","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Mr. Anani D. was born in 1979 in Nots\u00e8.

She plans to invest this loan in merchandise for her store. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":448410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To invest in her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-12-14T17:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesar Mauricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isidora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelida Eulogia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noemi Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gaby Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia Yanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violeta Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karen Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1360},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1360},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1360},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1360},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1360}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":470,"local_amount":1360,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064599},{"amount":470,"local_amount":1360,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899659},{"amount":470,"local_amount":1360,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933741},{"amount":470,"local_amount":1360,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661338},{"amount":470,"local_amount":1360,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694025}],"funded_date":"2009-12-29T14:22:35Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":166117,"name":"Liz Danisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuestra socia Liz Danisa tiene 31 a\u00f1os, es madre soltera y tiene tres hijos y es padre y madre de sus tres hijos: Liz Magaly tiene 11 a\u00f1os, Tania tiene 4 a\u00f1os y Alex tiene 3 a\u00f1os.

Go #1. He is 35 years old, single, and has four children who are 2, 9, 11 and 14 years old. The oldest child is in 7th grade, and the youngest is in 1st grade. Gabriel himself was only able to complete school through the 10th grade.\r\n\r\nGabriel owns a footwear business in the Waterside market, which is the largest market in Monrovia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ikrom is 24 years old. He is married and has two kids. This gentleman is a vegetable producer with more than six years of experience. Ikrom works all day on the land. He is involved in the whole production process, including post-harvest and selling. It is relevant to explain that the production of vegetables requires adequate fertilizer in order to generate the expected harvest. Nutrients and chemical fertilizers are needed throughout the process. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Ikrom is having difficulties getting into the market with his product due to the fact that he doesn't have enough organic matter to incorporate into the soil. There isn\u2019t enough fertilizer and the soils are poor in nutrients. It is for these reasons that his harvests aren\u2019t going well. Ikrom lacks the capital to be able to correctly prepare the land and thereby achieve a successful harvest so that he can sell his vegetables in the different markets. He is hoping for your generosity and is very thankful to all of you.    \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 35 years old, is divorced, and has 3 children who are 15, 10 and 4 years old. The two older children attend school. Recardina only studied through 7th grade, and didn't continue because of a long illness. She lives with her children in a house provided for her by family members and helps support her siblings by sending them money to help with household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe left Magude for Boane with her parents in 1987, in search of better living conditions. She has had her own business for more than 16 years, having started after her separation, and has one employee who helps her with her work. She has a monthly income of around 6000 Meticales. She uses this money to cover household expenses and she is also able to save some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nRecardina has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through friends who also work with the institution. This is her 2nd loan, for the amount of 9000 Meticales. She plans to use this money to buy construction materials (metal plates, beams, cement, iron, sand and other items) in order to continue working on the construction of her home. Her earlier loan was for 9000 Meticales and was used for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future she would like to apply for more loans to finish her house and offer her children a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine

pesticide-selling venture. In that season, Inomjon acquired adequate income and that income was used to improve his home and to save for the children\u2019s education expenses. \r\n\r\nBecause he spent the season diligently selling fertilizer, his own land is unprepared for planting. Currently, it is the rainy season, the  appropriate and suitable time for planting. Inomjon has taken the initiative to resume working on his land while selling fertilizer. He requires funds to purchase farm supplies such as seeds and fertilizer. Inomjon is optimistic that his venture will be successful and all his efforts will improve the family\u2019s welfare.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She came from San Mart\u00edn looking for a better future in this red land, and it has gone well for her up to now since she has always worked in her store, and as she has mentioned to us, thanks to her husband's work and her own effort she has been able to build them a house and give them a decent place to live with their children.\n\nWhat Elvira likes most about her work is that there is always some movement. What she does not like is that often some people come who want to buy products on credit and who are late in paying off their bill.\n\nShe hopes that later she will be able to expand her store. She has not done it yet because she has always used her earnings to expand her house.\n\nThis is Elvira's third loan with MFP. She is a little dissatisfied with her group because some of them do not pay on time. In the end they always end up paying, but sometimes they get behind. With the 1000 soles she asked for, Elvira will buy groceries and drinks so she can keep doing her work. She hopes to continue working with the institution since she is grateful for the amount they have lent her and for the low interest rates they offer.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":856970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries and drinks so she can keep doing her work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-05T19:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":154.42},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":155.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":163.69},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":168.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":176.05},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":181.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.27},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.22},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.02},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.18,"local_amount":309.8,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":317.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851241},{"amount":61.38,"local_amount":163.69,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:04Z","rounded_local_amount":167.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666420},{"amount":63.22,"local_amount":168.59,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":172.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621575},{"amount":66.02,"local_amount":176.05,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":180.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245434},{"amount":68.2,"local_amount":181.87,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":186.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099890}],"funded_date":"2011-09-18T15:19:19Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":334731,"name":"Moses","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moses is 44 years old and married with six children, living in his own house in Masindi, Uganda.

The most common crops in this area are fodder (to feed cows to produce milk) and maize to prepare Ugali \u201chard porridge\u201d. \r\n\r\nRichard, who has been farming for the last seven years, keeps cattle, poultry and trees on his piece of land. He is seeking a loan for purchasing a chaff cutter. Dairy cows prefer their fodder cut into pieces of a certain size. Not so big that it is hard to digest and not so small that it is not \"fun\" to chew. A chaff cutter solves this problem perfectly. Electrically operated, a chaff cutting machine chops fodder into small, even pieces that the cows will enjoy chewing. The other advantage of the machine is that different grasses can be fed into it to achieve a desired feed ration. This creates mixtures that lead to higher milk production, since the cows cannot select what to eat and what not to. The increase in income from this asset will uplift the livelihood of Richard's family.

Yao Adj\u00e9t\u00e9 was bon in 1954, he is father of four (04) children born to different mothers and is in charge of eleven (11), other children. As a volunteer school teacher, he earns a miserable and irregular salary, and as a result, his life is miserable. After his marital mishaps, he pulled himself together and currently shares his life with only one woman in his village \u201cAlinka\u201d. The village currently suffers from lack of clean water chiefly during the dry season where water becomes a scarce commodity. Women and children go a long way to buy water.\r\nHe is very dynamic and sociable, and as the president of the village development committee (CVD), he had the idea of initiating a drilling to help the population find potable water in the village. The ever growing density of the local population fostered the profitability of the project. The rigorous sense of management shown by Mr. N. with his (03) credits which he promptly reimbursed allowed us to believe in his abilities to succeeded in this ambitious and humanitarian project.    \r\n\r\nOn that purpose, he applied for a credit of $2,000 that will allow realising the drilling from which the water will be sold to the population. Note that in Togo, water is not free of charge. It is sold and at a high price in places where it is scarce. \r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur N. Yao Adj\u00e9t\u00e9, n\u00e9 en 1954, il est p\u00e8re de quatre (04) enfants de m\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente et a \u00e0 sa charge onze (11) autres personnes. Enseignant volontaire avec un salaire minable et irr\u00e9gulier, il m\u00e8ne une vie de mis\u00e8re. Apr\u00e8s ses m\u00e9saventures conjugales, il s\u2019est ressaisi et vit aujourd\u2019hui avec une seule femme dans son village natal \u00ab Alinka \u00bb. Ledit village souffre terriblement de probl\u00e8mes d\u2019eau potable, surtout pendant la saison s\u00e8che o\u00f9  l\u2019eau devient une denr\u00e9e tr\u00e8s rare et tr\u00e8s cher. Les bonnes femmes et les enfants parcourent de longue distance pour aller payer de l\u2019eau. Tr\u00e8s dynamique et sociable, et en sa qualit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9sident du comit\u00e9 villageois de d\u00e9veloppement (CVD), il eut l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019initier un forage pour aider la population \u00e0 trouver de l\u2019eau potable sur place dans le village. La densit\u00e9 de la population sans cesse croissante dans cette localit\u00e9 favorise la rentabilit\u00e9 de ce projet. La gestion rigoureuse dont Monsieur N. a toujours fait preuve \u00e0 travers ses trois (03) cr\u00e9dits re\u00e7us et rembours\u00e9s promptement permet de croire \u00e0 la r\u00e9ussite de ce projet ambitieux et humanitaire.\r\n\r\nPour ce faire, il sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $2000 qui servira \u00e0 faire le forage dont l\u2019eau sera vendue \u00e0 la population.

Ernesto Z., 45 years of age and married, is a native of Homoine, Inhambane province. Due to an early marriage, he never attended school beyond the 7th grade. Once he discontinued his studies, he began to work for a civil construction company to help confront the great challenge of being a father at the young age of 16. Months later, once his contract ended, he started an unsuccessful firewood cutting business. He started selling cow\u2019s milk and raising chickens, an activity he continues to this day. Through conversations with friends he learned of Hluvuku-Adsema (Field Partner), who he became acquainted with and solicited a loan for the purchase of egg-laying hens. His income helps him support familial expenses, and his children\u2019s educational and health expenses, as well as invest in the construction of his house. With this loan he intends to buy hens to supply the market of Boane with fresh eggs, as well as sell chickens and milk. His business\u2019 impact on the community is a positive one because beyond providing employment for himself, his wife, and children, he also plays an important part in the supply of animal protein, calcium and other vitamins derived from cow\u2019s milk, thus contributing to the essential nourishment of the community. His future goals include expanding his business and diversifying his products. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>Jos\u00e9 Ernesto Z., de 45 anos de idade, casado, natural de Homoine, provincial de Inhambane. Devido ao casamento precoce n\u00e3o estudou para alem da 7\u00aa classe, logo deixou de estudar e come\u00e7ou a trabalhar numa empresa de constru\u00e7\u00e3o civil, para conseguir enfrentar o grande desafio de ser pai com idade menor de 16 anos.\r\n\r\nMeses depois, findo o contrato de trabalho,  pensou e fez numa actividade de corte de lenha e, segundo conta, n\u00e3o teve sucesso. Come\u00e7ou a vender leite de vaca e a criar frangos de corte, actividaes que exerce ate hoje .\r\n\r\nAtrav\u00e9s de conversas com amigos soube da exist\u00eancia da Hluvuku- Adsema , aproximou-se e solicitou um empr\u00e9stimo para compra de galinha poedeiras de ovos.\r\nCom os rendimentos suporta as despensas familiares, investe na amplia\u00e7\u00e3o da sua casa, despesas  de Sa\u00fade, Educa\u00e7\u00e3o para os filhos.\r\nCom o valor do empr\u00e9stimo pretende comprar poedeiras para poder abastecer o mercado de boane com ovos frescos, para al\u00e9m da venda frangos e leite que j\u00e1 exerce actualmente.\r\n\r\nA actividade tem um impacto positivo na comunidade porque para alem de providenciar emprego para ele pr\u00f3prio mais a sua esposa e filhos, desempenha um papel importante no fornecimento de prote\u00edna animal, c\u00e1lcio e outras vitaminas provenientes de leite de vaca contribuindo para a seguran\u00e7a alimentar e Nutri\u00e7\u00e3o da comunidade.\r\n\r\nTem como perspectiva, fazer crescer o neg\u00f3cio cada vez mais, diversificando os produtos.

At 50, she has managed to have her own house. She lives by herself since she never had children with her ex-husband, who she divorced. She is an adept artisan and utilizes the bulrush (a wetland plant) to create beautiful and striking artisanal pieces, which she sells to her customers at a good price. Although she did not finish primary education due to the lack of necessary funds, she was not discouraged. She followed her plans to have a dignified life and to continue with the things she has always dreamed of doing. She has fought hard to forge a good life. She knows that she still needs to continue making jewelry. She has spent 20 years in this business. What she likes the most is that she can make new, creative designs which result in improved sales. What she finds the most difficult is to make the small details to her pieces to make them more beautiful. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she dreams of having her own store where she can sell her pieces with the most comfort and tranquility. It is her first loan with MFP and she is very happy for this opportunity. She understands that she must pay the loan on time and is determined to do so. The communal bank is very beloved, as it always provides council for the other members.

The oldest daughter of the five children is 17 years old and goes to Gurvan-Erdene University in the city and the other four children are high school students. Chagnaadorj's family moved to the capital city from Arhangai province 6 years ago, in search of a better life for his family and better business for himself. He owns a small old car that he uses as a taxi in the city. He also makes horse saddles from wood. He learned how to make horse saddle from his dad and his children help him in making various size saddles. His wife sells the saddle at the local market. He has been making saddles since 2003 and today it has grown into a family business in which almost all family members contribute in one way or another. He says that he would like to make his family business bigger and secure his children's future. He requests a loan to purchase saddle wood and other necessary materials for his saddle-making business.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

Leone. They have come to SMT\/Kiva Lenders to apply for a loan of SLL 500,000 per member to expand their businesses. With the help of this loan, they can add more goods to their businesses, make more sales, earn more profit and consequently improve their standard of living. \r\n\r\nThe leader of this group is Mariatu K.. Mariatu was born in the small town of Yoni, in northern Sierra Leone. The 40-year-old is married to a professional worker and they have 4 children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She tells us that she is not always able to meet her customers\u2019 needs, due to a lack of working capital.\r\n\r\nShe received literature from Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya, telling of the entrepreneur support programs and she liked the idea, so she requested a loan.  She is grateful for the trust and values the opportunity that the institution has given her.  She will use the money to buy bookstore items, such as notebooks and paper.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":545792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Coronel Oviedo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.416667 -56.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusebia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":2300008,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":172272},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":176657},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":181154},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":185765},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":190494},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":195343},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200315},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":205414},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":210643},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":216005},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":215946}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.61},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.4},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.39},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.41},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.55},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.96},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.06,"local_amount":322272,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":332079.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151898320},{"amount":38.4,"local_amount":176657,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":182032.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159638563},{"amount":39.38,"local_amount":181154,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":186666.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166852571},{"amount":40.39,"local_amount":185765,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":191418.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172119350},{"amount":41.41,"local_amount":190494,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":196290.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177413352},{"amount":42.46,"local_amount":195343,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":201287.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182553030},{"amount":43.55,"local_amount":200315,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":206410.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188689471},{"amount":184.35,"local_amount":848008,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":873813.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428758}],"funded_date":"2010-06-01T15:37:05Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She has 6 children from her first marriage, who are all working independently in the city of Lima. Currently, she is sharing her life with Julio, age 49, with whom she has a 22-year-old son, Michael. They live in their own house which is made of wood. For more than two years, Felicia has worked selling food in her restaurant located in a space in her house. The restaurant is affectionately called \"El Moreno\" [\"Brown-Skinned Man\"]. She also prepares sweets and mazamorras [corn puddings] in the evenings, which she offers on the street. In addition, some days she helps her husband cultivate his crops of avocado, coffee and bananas, since both of them have worked in agriculture for 19 years. What Felicia loves most is cooking and selling what she prepares, since her earnings allow the family to live comfortably. For that reason, she now wants to construct a house of solid materials, expand her restaurant, add beverages to her offerings, and plant more coffee so that she can become a recognized and significant producer of this crop in her area. This is her seventh loan with MFP, and she is enthusiastic about continuing to work with her communal bank, because it is made up of good people who have a strong sense of solidarity and are very dependable, like she is. With the loan she is requesting, she will buy several sacks of fertilizer or compost which she will spread on her banana fields.        \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":578439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buying fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-04T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1057.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269246}],"funded_date":"2010-08-05T00:06:08Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":224089,"name":"Filomena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Filomena M., age 36, owns and operates a general store in the village of Calamagui, San Paublo, where she sells a variety of different products.

ventures:   abaca weaving, food vending and general store businesses.  She lives in Mantija 2, Mantija, Danao City. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her abaca weaving, food vending and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,500. Gemma is now borrowing PHP 11,000 so that she can use the money as additional working capital.  This will be her 3rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 7,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  \r\n\r\nGemma aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n About NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his wife and two children ages 9 and 3, in an urban area called Orquideas, which means Orchids.  The town was named for the discovery of its many orchids and you'll find a park full of the flowers there.   Geovin's mother taught him about the business and how to buy meat at the best prices.  When she became ill, Geovin took charge of the business.   He's been running the small butcher's shop for 8 years, working on his own from very early morning when he buys the meat, until the end of the day when the market closes.  Geovin aspires to grow his business into a large shop.  For that he not only needs to continue working hard, but also needs capital to invest.  He is requesting a loan to purchase more meat, as well as a freezer.  In the next 5 years, he would like to be able to purchase a car so that he can transport the meat more easily.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":641577,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase meat and a freezer to help grow his butcher business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Orquideas)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-11-17T16:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Geovin Andres ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75.04},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":76.28},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":78.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":81.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":84.04},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":85.59},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":87.85},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":89.61},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":91.69},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":93.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.04},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.28},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.05},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.85},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.61},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.69},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150.27,"local_amount":150.27,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":150.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188681385},{"amount":76.28,"local_amount":76.28,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:46:12Z","rounded_local_amount":76.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191379701},{"amount":78.05,"local_amount":78.05,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":78.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797695},{"amount":81.42,"local_amount":81.42,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:22:04Z","rounded_local_amount":81.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201240358},{"amount":81.75,"local_amount":81.75,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:45:50Z","rounded_local_amount":81.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206106291},{"amount":84.04,"local_amount":84.04,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-20T07:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":84.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211863044},{"amount":85.59,"local_amount":85.59,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":85.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216459524},{"amount":87.85,"local_amount":87.85,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":87.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221623369},{"amount":89.61,"local_amount":89.61,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":89.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226992633},{"amount":91.69,"local_amount":91.69,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":91.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232751727},{"amount":93.45,"local_amount":93.45,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":93.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238555889}],"funded_date":"2010-12-01T22:59:27Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:32:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily charnes","image":51249}},{"id":252781,"name":"Ligia Columbia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ligia de 60 a\u00f1os, tiene una peque\u00f1a papeler\u00eda.

He\u2019s a resident of a small town with a population of 16 000, called Toktogul.

After getting his driver\u2019s license, he decided that his favorite occupation, driving, could also be a good means of revenue. Bakhtiyar\u2019s taxi route is between Toktogul-Bishkek (the capital of Kyrgyzstan). He has acquired regular clients and drives up to 600 kilometers per route. Bakhtiyar sees his car as a main source of income, so he requested a loan in order to replace the engine and some parts. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, Pacita is requesting a loan of 30,000 PHP. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of quality golf balls to sell. She knows that having a lot of stock will attract more customers to her store.
