The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":320389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase crops in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T19:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rahimata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":704287.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773305}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T03:08:21Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":113021,"name":"Lolo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les quatre  femmes du groupe Lolo sont toutes mari\u00e9es et ont une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge 30 ans et  2 enfants.

Their restaurant is situated in the heart of their village and is a stopover point for travelers and merchants coming from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (a sister country bordering this area of Mali). \r\nTo meet the ever-increasing customer demand, this group has decided to turn to the microloan institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which the group is on its third solidarity loan.

The women purchase their stock in the Fakola market with traveling merchants and sell their goods in the market to a diverse and affluent client base. \r\nThey each hope to make 60,000 CFA in profit that will be used to pay the interest on the loan, provide for their families, and invest back into their business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Manuel Carreiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":329332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of ingredients for restaurant ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kolondi\u00e8ba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chiata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":433.33,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":200587.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243068},{"amount":216.68,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":100293.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678925},{"amount":216.67,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":100293.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112678},{"amount":216.67,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":100293.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028244},{"amount":216.65,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":100293.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873582}],"funded_date":"2009-07-03T11:35:40Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Manuel Carreiro","image":null}},{"id":117117,"name":"Elioba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Elioba is 29 years old and is married to a driver.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use to buy more inventory for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future business improvements. Analyn M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He also sells jewelry made with Brazilian goldfill and silver. Gessler was born in a Santanderean home (people who are born in the Santander department), where independent business and a great work ethic are a part of his culture. In his family experience, and since he was very small, he learned everything to be able to have his own business, without neglecting his studies. That is why he also graduated as a laboratory technician from the university.  It was there that he started to sell jewelry to his classmates, professors and school employees. He was helped by working capital that was given to him: his father gave her $200.000 COP, his aunt gave him another $200.000 COP and his mother, another borrower from the Fundaci\u00f2n, gave him  $200.000 COP. With that, he had all his initial capital.  \r\n\r\nPresently, he is asking for his first loan from the Fundaci\u00f2n Mario Santo Domingo. He needs working capital to be able to respond to orders that new customers have made and he needs to be able to respond quickly. With it, he will buy various merchandise such as women's clothes, silver and Brazilian goldfill jewelry such as: bracelets, earrings, chains, anklets and rings.    \r\n\r\nHis dream is to have his own house that can have a locale where he can exhibit all of the products he sells. At present, his biggest challenge is the competition that exists in the market with lesser quality products. He has to make a bigger effort to position his products in the market. At present, his business has a current ratio of 7.23, and a total debt of 13.4%. With the new Kiva loan, it will be 28.45, while he manages some accounts payable that rotate every 27 days. His inventory turnover is 51 days, and his accounts payable rotation is 14.8 days. \r\n\r\nGessler is a young man who is very capable of getting ahead in everything he sets his mind on. With his enterprising spirit, it is very probable that he wil generate a future, not only for his own income, but also a job for a lot of people. This is what Gessler really dreams of.

She earns her living by operating a sari-sari store and a sugarcane farming business. Her husband Ernesto, who is 50 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are between 14 and 27 years old. Flory joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Flory has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to use as additional funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Flory is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Their ages range from 26 up to 60 years of age.  The majority of its members only completed elementary education and have dedicated themselves to agricultural activities in order to help their families, who in most cases, is the only source of income for the household.  This is the first loan from Banco Mujer Mujeres En Accion (Women's Comunal Bank Women in Action) and they heard of the services of Fundacion Mujer thanks to the current treasurer, Emilce Bermudez who had been in a comunal group for more than 4 years.\r\n\r\nThe members will invest the loan in the purchase of pigs, chickens, calves, feed, concentrates, fertilizers, chemicals and other inputs to raise livestock and grow cocoa.  The members have many years experience in their productive activities but do not have the working capital to grow their businesses; and if we add to these struggles the high cost of raw materials, product transportation costs, lack of a stable market, and the low prices in which they manage to sell their products, all of these obstacles are what they have to face day-to-day.  This is why the loan is of great help for all of the entrepreneurs who make up Banco Mujer.\r\nThe group has set forth very important objectives such as: growing their business, becoming self-sufficient, continuing their education, and many more. This loan is the first step to reach those objectives."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3325,"image":{"id":759552,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase Pigs, Poultry, Livestock and Agriculture","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Roxana, L\u00edmon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2011-04-29T08:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3325,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marileth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Iris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonor ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinthya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marianela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Xinia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1650000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1650000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":3325,"local_amount":1650000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1650862.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238616050}],"funded_date":"2011-04-29T19:55:33Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:19:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gustavo  Gutierrez","image":430326}},{"id":298259,"name":"Koba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Koba is 29 years old.

She lives in her own house and she is 50 years old.  She has worked hard to give her 3 children, Alexander, Jakeline and Flor, the life that they deserve.  Her children now help her with her business.  She sell clothes out of her home and she enjoys talking to her customers.  The hardest part of her business is getting the clothing to sell, since she needs to get the prettiest and most elegant clothing.  Her business is very profitable.  She also sells clothing to small stores and stands.  These stores buy the items directly from Juana's house.  Juana has 8 years of experience in the business and it has given her the knowledge that she needs to make the business grow.  She wants to open her own store in a central location.  She wants to sell more and to increase her income.  This will be Juana's second loan through MFP and she knows that she will have to work hard so that she can make all of the payments.  She is also the secretary and her communal bank and she has to be a example for everyone.  She will invest the money for the loan in the purchase of new merchandise,  like shoes, blouses, jeans, etc. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kendra Gaete, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":269968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase Her Merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-13T23:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:29Z","rounded_local_amount":161.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117048},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":161.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011961},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":161.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595547},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":161.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989808},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":161.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210944},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":161.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640449}],"funded_date":"2009-02-14T16:12:16Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kendra Gaete","image":null}},{"id":92557,"name":"Simon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Simon is 33 years old and married with a child.

Her greatest desire in life is to give Maira a good life, even if she has to work a lot to make it possible. \r\n\r\nElena has a vending station in the  San Jos\u00e9 market (a large market in the city of Juliaca) where she sells toys. She is very happy with her business, seeing it's quite profitable. She has been in this business for two years.

This is also the reason she decided to start this business.\r\n\r\nIn future, Elena hopes to have a larger shop where she can sell many more toys. To do this, she knows she must work very hard and without breaks. The most difficult aspect of Elena's work is transporting the toys from the city of Tacna (a city in the south of Peru, near the border with Chile), seeing the trip is very long and tiring. As such, it takes a lot of time to acquire her merchandise.\r\n\r\nThis is Elena's second loan with MFP [Kiva partner]. She understands that she needs to pay it back on time and is prepared to do so. Elena is a very responsible member of her community bank. She always makes sure agreements among members are fully met. She plans to use the requested loan of 500 soles [about US $175] to purchase more toys in order to improve how her shop operates and, in doing so, provide greater variety to her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Todd M.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":320436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To increase production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Uyuni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":701137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773311}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T03:41:13Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":113037,"name":"Alexandra Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alexandra C.

She is the coordinator for her group, Si Se PueD. (Yes You Can), and her story is representative of the other borrowers of the group.\r\n\r\nCarolina lives in a part of Santo Domingo called Guaricanos VilL. MelL., one of the poorest parts of the capital. Here, running water (never potable) and electricity are unreliable at best. Despite these difficulties, Carolina runs a successful business selling clothing to her friends and neighbors. Unlike many others who sell packets of used clothing, Carolina only buys new clothing to sell. With this loan she plans on buying two dozen blouses, six dozen pairs of pants, and also a new case of perfumes. \r\n\r\nThis is Carolina\u2019s second loan with Esperanza International. She appreciates the opportunity of financing that her business now receives. Carolina\u2019s dream is to have a business big enough that she will need to hire two or three employees. For her family, she hopes to one day build a house that they can call their own. Thank you for lending to Carolina and the Si Se PueD. group!

She lives in a big traditional family in the Darsalam neighborhood of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali.) \r\n\r\nNot having attended school for socio-economic reasons, she began at a young age to do petty trading together with her mother who sold condiments. After several years' apprenticeship, she was well versed in that commercial activity. She learned dyeing during her stay in S\u00e9gou from a lady for whom she was working as a maid. She has been working in this trade for 15 years and has a lot of experience and is well-known. Her strength in sales is due not only to the quality of her dyeing but also of her cloth. \r\n\r\nTo do her dyeing, she dilutes the various products used for modern and traditional cloth dyeing in hot water. Then she soaks the white fabrics in this liquid to give them the desired color. Then the dyed cloth is hung out on a line to dry. After that she brings them to the seamstress and once the clothes are sewn, they are  washed and ironed and carefully wrapped.  \r\n\r\nWishing to grow her working capital so as to make more profit, she came to Soro Yiriwaso. She is on her first loan which she intends to use to buy two \"less rich\" lengths of \"bazin\" (damask).  She buys the cloth where she works. \r\n\r\nMrs. Fatoumata M.  sells for cash and credit to a clientele composed of women and men. With this loan she hopes to make a monthly profit of 40,000 F CFA. This profit will allow her to support herself (paying rent, food, and for medicines.) Her ambition is to have more resources to enable her to do well in her business since she has plenty of experience and clients. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":579367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"buying the necessary supplies to do dyeing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":32239.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180828},{"amount":65,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":32239.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476799},{"amount":65,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":32239.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613508},{"amount":65,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":32239.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751940},{"amount":65,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":32239.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606192}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T09:22:03Z","paid_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":224509,"name":"Estrelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Estrelita D. is from the village of Barangay Bonfal West, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya.

Berth herself has attended school up to secondary level.

Her husband is a fisherman \u2013 that\u2019s why one source of their income is from fishing. Her husband works hard in the day catching fish in the lake, but he only brings home a small amount of money because the owner of the fishing equipment gets a larger amount \u2013 they only give him a percent.\r\n\r\nSo Isabelita decided to apply for a loan from Kiva's field partner, Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), to buy the things needed in fishing so that the revenue will be only for them. She will use the loan to buy fishing cages (fish traps), fishing nets, and other things needed in the fishing business. She will help her husband sell the fish he catches in the lake. \r\n\r\nIsabelita decided to put up this business in order to increase their daily income and meet their needs, like everyday expenses and the education of their two children. With more fish to catch and sell, Isabelita believes that sales will increase leading to higher revenue. As a dedicated member of ASHI, she ensures strong performance with regular attendance at group meetings and steady repayments. Isabelita is thankful for access to capital and loans to support her entrepreneurial dreams. With the support of ASHI and Kiva, she is hopeful that her business will continue to flourish to improve the family\u2019s quality of life and fund her children\u2019s education until they finish college.

She buys her merchandise locally at Sikasso\u2019s main market.\r\nThe merchandise is then sold for cash or credit to a clientele consisting of women and young (single) people, especially those who stay up very late. \r\nShe expects to make a monthly profit of CFA 100,000 which will mainly be used to increase her working capital.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":230446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy chickens, beans, bananas, fresh fish, spaghetti, yam semolina and potatoes ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:46Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":20640.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974116},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:26:48Z","rounded_local_amount":20640.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889492},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:14Z","rounded_local_amount":20640.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440285},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":20640.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135653},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":20640.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033454},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":20640.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620821},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:28Z","rounded_local_amount":20640.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019812},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":20640.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242582},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":20640.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678091},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":20640.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112384}],"funded_date":"2008-12-03T00:13:29Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:54:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Llewellyn","image":44015}},{"id":80301,"name":"Soy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soy S., 39, is married and lives with three children and her husband in Kampong Cham Province.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Neema thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

San Vicente has a cold climate that favors agriculture, and beautiful scenery that attracts domestic and foreign tourists. The people of San Vincente are simple and kind.\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Rosa Beatriz C. D. lives in San Vicente and is one of the founding members of its community bank. She is 48 years old, is married, and has four children ages 11, 21, 25, and 27. Rosa lives alone with her last child who is still studying in primary school. Her two older children are now married and her third child studies and works in the city of Cuenca. Rosa's husband lived abroad for several years to save money to build their house in San Vicente.\r\n<p>\r\nRosa has worked in embroidery for twenty years. Her business is doing well due to a steady clientele that orders embroidered skirts and blouses (a native clothing of Cuenca). Rose also raises chickens, guinea pigs, sheep, pigs and cattle, and sells the animals in her community.\r\n <p>\r\nRosa has spent four years working with the loan foundation and says that the new loan that you submit to the Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir will be invested in buying materials to build a house for her son.\r\n<p>\r\nRosa's goal is also to buy a car for her son who works and studies in Cuenca so he can get home at night.\r\n<p>\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda Dolores C. is another member of the Saint Vincent community bank. She is 39 years old and married with four children ages 12, 14, 16, and 19. Her eldest daughter is a knitting aid, the second works in a carpentry workshop, the third son helps with the care of the family's animals at home, and the youngest son is studying in school in Portete del Victoria. The family lives in a house that was built by Mar\u00eda's husband, who works in construction.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda works in the family business and has fourteen years of embroidery experience. She tells us that she has a steady clientele that brings work to her home and that she is also engaged in raising and selling livestock, such as chickens and guinea pigs, and selling milk obtained from cattle dairy delivery trucks. The family's animals are for consumption and for sale at Cuenca's open air market.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's fourth loan working with the Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir. She will use her livestock to obtain new loans that she will invest in the purchase of grass for her livestock. Because of drought, there is not enough grass for nutrition. The money will also be used to cover some costs of their home.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda's goal is to a build a new home and buy a car. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Bryce Holland, Kiva

Even though they are adults, they still look to their mother for company or as a voice of support that will listen to them. Like most mothers, she was a homemaker when her children were still young. However, she had the desire to do other things. After many years passed, her oldest son began working at Topy Top (a Latin American chain of apparel stores) because his partner was about to give to their child and he wanted to be responsible. After the baby was born, Sara\u2019s son developed a serious case of bronchitis. Being a good mother, Sara began selling prepared meals during his recovery so that she could purchase his medicines and look after her daughter-in-law and grandchild. \r\n<p>\r\nEven though this was a difficult time, everything turned out well in the end. Sara continues to sell meals out of her home because she found it to be an easy and enjoyable way to make money. She spends most of the time working out of her kitchen, utilizing her refrigerator and cooking utensils. Sara now hopes to open both a mini-market and a restaurant. With her hard work and perseverance, she knows she can fulfill this goal.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

The members of this group are from the city of Temuco. They are involved in dessert-making, sewing, running a book store, a general store, and selling chocolates, household materials, clothing and undergarments, fruit and flowers.\r\n\r\nThe group member for this interview was Elizabeth, who is the group\u2019s treasurer. In the photo she is in the front row, on the left, in a green sweater, holding the hand of one of her associate\u2019s sons. She runs a general store out of her home where she sells fruit, basic household goods, and other items. She runs the business on her own.\r\n\r\nElizabeth will invest this loan in more merchandise (sugar, rice, pasta, detergent, and shampoo), and in firewood and coal, which will be needed in this region in southern Chile for the cold winter. Because these are needed products, this will be a good business. Her dream is to increase the variety of merchandise in her store.\r\n\r\nElizabeth\u2019s greatest motivation is her 13 year-old daughter; she wants to give her everything she needs for her basic and advanced studies so that she can secure a solid economic future for herself.\r\n\r\nWhat Elizabeth has liked best about working with Fondo Esperanza has been the opportunity the organization has given her to move forward, without putting up obstacles to her ability to access credit. Additionally, the good treatment she has received in the entrepreneur training and educational workshops, has made her feel valued and important.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. It is located 670 kilometers south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lake-side spa resorts and striking flora and fauna. This region is also noteworthy for being the region where 50% of Chile\u2019s indigenous Mapuche community live; some of whom are members of Fondo Esperanza communal

and comes from San Raymundo. Her husband is in the United States. They have 4 children, 3 of whom still live with her; one is already grown. Her work is selling pork meat and chicharrones [fried pork skin] from her home. She has done this work for 25 years now, and she says that it has gone very well for her. For that reason, she would like to increase her sales. She would now like to invest part of the loan in buying small pigs to fatten up and later butcher. In this way, she hopes to achieve a little more profit, since large pigs are rather expensive to buy. She would like to invest the other part of the loan funds in buying large pigs. She hopes to achieve her goals and even more. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":579407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Investing in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Raymundo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.764722 -90.595556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2010-08-06T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hercilia Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T08:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":500.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172712563},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:45:12Z","rounded_local_amount":500.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396323},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":500.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534879},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:46:12Z","rounded_local_amount":500.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189137537},{"amount":63.05,"local_amount":504.4,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":504.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414962},{"amount":125.15,"local_amount":1001.2,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1001.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195833557},{"amount":126.57,"local_amount":1012.6,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-17T07:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206397878},{"amount":62.35,"local_amount":498.8,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":499.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211216316},{"amount":62.42,"local_amount":499.4,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":499.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216494684},{"amount":60.46,"local_amount":483.6,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T07:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":483.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221958303}],"funded_date":"2010-08-09T05:26:52Z","paid_date":"2011-08-17T07:46:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":224541,"name":"Flordeliza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flordeliza D. is from the village of Brgy.

Ella va a utilizar sus ganancias para seguir invirtiendo en su negocio.\n\nEst\u00e1 asociada de Esperanza comenz\u00f3 con nosotros porque necesitaba invertir en su negocio. Su historia est\u00e1 siendo usada para representar a los dem\u00e1s miembros de su grupo y a los clientes de Esperanza, tanto los haitianos (quienes en su mayor\u00eda ha emigrado hacia la Republica Dominicana desde Hait\u00ed, algunos de ellos recientemente) y los dominicanos, quienes por lo general viven en comunidades muy pobres, esta zona, como muchas otras zonas de escasos recursos en la Republica Dominicana, carecen de agua potable y energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica constante. Este grupo se encuentra ubicado en una zona bordeada de campos de ca\u00f1a en San Pedro de Macoris, una ciudad famosa por sus jugadores de pelota y por la industria azucarera, su econom\u00eda actual depende de la Zona franca, la industria D. cemento y otras actividades menores como el turismo.\n\nLa persona en el circulo, no pertenece al grupo, es el acompa\u00f1ante de uno de los miembros.","en":"Santos (or Estela, as she is known to everyone) is a member of the group Hope and Striving 3 & 4. The members sell clothes, cosmetics, shoes, food, etc. Her family is made up of her, her husband, and their 4 children, who she enjoys hugely. She also loves to go to the church and sing. Her main challenge at the moment is to build an apartment to rent out and generate income for the family.\r\nSantos is very excited to receive her 7th loan from Esperanza Internacional after having successfully repaid her previous loans and having taken the first steps in growing her business. She has had her business for about 6 years, and she started it with her first loan. Santos plans to use the new loan to buy food (rice, beans, oil, sugar, etc) for her small grocery store, a business that depends on selling all sorts of food and other products. It is a little community store. She is going to use the income to continue investing in her business. \r\nShe started this association with us because she needed to invest in her business. Her story is being used to represent the rest of the members of this group who are clients of Esperanzo, who are a mix of Haitians (who for the most part have emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti, some of them recently) and Dominicans, who for the most part live in very poor communities. This area, in common with many other resource poor areas of the Dominican Republic, lacks potable water and a reliable electricity supply. This group can be found in an area at the edge of the sugar cane fields of San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for its baseball players and for the sugar industry. Its present day economy depends on the free trade zone, the cement industry, and other more minor activities like tourism. \r\nThe person circled in the picture is not a member of the group - this is someone who was accompanying one of the group members."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":613055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

M. is from the village of Brgy.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Concepcion has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Concepcion joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Concepcion is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Concepcion from ASKI. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married to a trader who earns Le500,000 every month  and has one child aged 10 years. She has two additional dependents, who live with her because they were brought by her husband from the village to assist them in their schooling.  \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Marie established her household utensil business.  She began her business because she was not privileged to go school and after she was full grown, her elder brother gave her some money to start selling cakes.  After she got married, her husband asked her to change the business to household utensils because of the fire risk involved in baking the cakes.  \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 9 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,095,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000.  Marie has already received and successfully repaid one loan and now requires a new loan in order to purchase drinking buckets 13 dozens @ Le1,740,000, bathing bucket 3 dozens @ Le330,000, set pans - 10 sets @ Le350,000, bowl pans - 5 dozens @ Le600,000, dish pan - 1 dozen @ Le900,000 and plastic bowls - 3 dozens @ Le450,000.  The balance of Le130,000 will be used for transportation.  \r\n\r\nMarie hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 164,250. In the future, Marie plans to build her own house and educate her children to university level.  She feels good because this loan will add to her capital and this loan will help her to improve her business and earn more income.  \r\n\r\nHer major challenge is that some of the items may get damaged or spoilt when travelling with them.  She serves about 10 customers each day.  The business is popular because the items are used by the majority of people and they are of good quality.  She is assisted by her younger sister who doesn't go to school.  Her suppliers are in Freetown and Guinea Conakry.    She usually uses public transport and she buys twice a month.  She saves some of her profit and ploughs the balance back into the business.   She is planning to expand and this can be achieved by adequate utilization of her capital and profit.  She is hardworking and honest.  She thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":902912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase drinking buckets 13 dozens @ Le1,740,000, bathing bucket 3 dozens @ Le330,000, set pans - 10 sets @ Le350,000, bowl pans - 5 dozens @ Le600,000, dish pan - 1 dozen @ Le900,000 and plastic bowls - 3 dozens @ Le450,000 with Le130,000 for transportation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-10-30T03:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":562500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:23:07Z","rounded_local_amount":563750.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244513974},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":563750.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721803},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":563750.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124709},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:24Z","rounded_local_amount":563750.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505616},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":563750.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974723},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":563750.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815293},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:04:46Z","rounded_local_amount":563750.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444354},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":563750.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537087}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T04:29:16Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:01:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":355713,"name":"Amado","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amado is 49 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Alcaraz is 28 years old, is married and has a 2-year-old son. A few years ago, motivated by the desire of self-improvement Mirta gathered her few savings and established her own microcompany. She opened a small kiosk on the municipal market of the city. \r\nThanks to the big commercial movement of the area, she was able to extend her business with the profit that she was obtaining. Today, she is a proprietor of a big grocery store where she commercializes all kinds of products of basic necessities, such as oil, noodles, canned products, candies, soap, etc.\r\nMirta works everyday from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. She tells us that her goal is to go so far as to buy her own house, since where she lives now it is a rented house. To increase her profits she wants to sell wholesale products since in the area where she is, there are many wholesale clients. For this reason she needs a loan of $600 that she will use to buy wholesale basic products such as oil, flour and sugar.\r\nWith this Mirta will obtain bigger profits that will allow her to save more and buy one day the house that she desires so much.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Ana Gabriela Clark, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>La se\u00f1ora Mirta L.

In the same way, in spite of having the major part of her day taken up by this work, she tries to enjoy it, especially since she has always liked to grow flowers.  The work does not appear hard for her, what does worry her, however, is the cost of the products that help her keep an adequate production level.<p>\r\nOlinda has a great love for her husband and her 15 year old son, which is the main driver in her life.  She is ready to continue growing, for which she needs money to buy seeds and fertilizers for her fields, with the purpose of increasing her income, her production and her orders in the flower markets.<p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Bobbit, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":203490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Invest in the purchase of gladiola seeds and fertilizers for her fields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-09-17T21:40:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-01T23:13:16Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":377.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335884},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":377.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957062},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":377.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227312},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:06Z","rounded_local_amount":377.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422551},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":377.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27115775},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":377.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36010761},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:53:39Z","rounded_local_amount":377.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594577},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":377.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989216}],"funded_date":"2008-09-17T23:13:16Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:36:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Bobbit","image":null}},{"id":68027,"name":"Muqabil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muqabil K. is 36 years old, married with three sons.

old woman who has completed medical school and now works as a laboratory doctor in the regional hospital. Fotima has 4 children and a husband who works as a minibus taxi driver. \r\nFotima came to Microinvest to obtain a loan to purchase a car for her oldest son. Her son wants to work as a taxi driver in his free time, since during winter there is very high demand for transportation among residents. She thinks that  spending a large sum on a purchase is made much easier by access to loans. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva

She is 34 years old, partnered and the mother of two children, 15 and 3 years old, respectively.  The children are students at the private San Juan Bautista school. \r\n<p>\r\nAfter finishing high school, Graciela sold beauty products for many years.  She then sold salchipapas (a traditional Peruvian dish) for more than a year, a business that was going very well but that she had to leave when she became pregnant and her days became too hectic.  When her daughter became older, she went back to work, this time selling clothes to friends and family.  Her friends recommended her to others and her business has consequently grown.  She buys clothes in the Gamarra La Victoria.  During the school year, she sells school uniforms and shoes.  \r\n<p>\r\nSince starting with Finca, she's had a lot of help.  They give her advice about improving her business, information about who sells her products and how to form a business.  She received a premium of $20 for a good payment record and for being on time to the meetings of the community bank.  She also managed to buy a Custer (moto-taxi) that her husband operates.  They only have five more payments to make to pay it off.  \r\n<p>\r\nGraciela needs an 800-soles loan to buy clothes already ordered by her customers but not yet paid for.  One of her  dreams is to have her own home-based business.  She wants to set up a bookstore but she needs a roof on her house.  She knows that little by little, she'll succeed.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":257063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy merchandise for clothing business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T03:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":217.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397257},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":217.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088961},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":435.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982297}],"funded_date":"2009-01-17T04:21:56Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:10:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":88509,"name":"Akhila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akhila A. is 41 years old.

The official name of this borrowing group is 036-Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng (18-01-036).\r\n\r\nH\u00e0 is married and has one school-aged child.  To make a living, H\u00e0 makes and sells rice products in the local community. H\u00e0 has been engaged in this business for more than five years and earns approximately 1.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, H\u00e0 joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

She is now requesting a new loan of 6.000.000 VND which will also be used to purchase additional products. This will be the fifth loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. H\u00e0 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n\r\n1. N.

It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":370555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It's located in Hueyapan in the Mexican state of Morelos.  The group has 5 members, all neighbors who have long known one another.  This is the group's first Fundacion Realidad loan.  \r\nSra. Aurelia P. A., a member of the group, is 56 years old.  She has 2 children: a son, Orlando, 30, and a daughter, Maria Isabel, 22.  Sra. Aurelia owns a grocery store and sells wholesale supplies of fruits, avocados and nuts.  She is applying for a loan to buy cooking oil, soap, toilet paper, salt, sugar, eggs, cold drinks, different kinds of chiles and sweets that she will resell in her store.  She started the business 15 years ago because she needed the income from it to live after her husband died.  He left her a small farm planted with avocado trees.  Her son helped her with the farm work, fertilizing the fields.  She goes to the Yecaplixtla market on Tuesdays and Fridays to sell bulk supplies of avocadoes and nuts.  She sells in Ozumba, as well.  Sra. Aurelia's daughter helps her with the housework and tends the store when she is away.  The business is in her house in the San Bartolo neighborhood of Hueyapan.  The store is called Lucero.  Sra. Aurelia has a truck in which she carries her goods to market, but it's in poor condition and needs new tires.  She has had to rent a truck recently which has been a drain on her income.  She would like to sell her goods in Ozumba because she can make more money there at a time when the store is barely getting by.  The earnings from the store go to paying the family's everyday expenses.  Earnings from the wholesale business are reinvested: buying nut trees; harvesting the nuts; packing them; buying fertilizer for the fields and the avocado trees; and using a tractor to prepare the land for new plantings.  Sra. Aurelia's hopes for the future are to reach a ripe old age, in good health and still able to work, and that her children be well and happy. She is pleased to get the loan and she will use it to buy more things for her business.  There are many kinds of trees in San Bartolo--pines, flowered trees, pear, peach, tejocotes, apple, etc.  The climate is cold.\r\nThe members of the group are Sra. Marcela R. F., who will buy fruits and vegetables to resell; Sra. Dominga Sandoval F. who will supplies to make Mexican antojitos for her prepared food business; Sra. Maria Isabel B.

This area is a part of the Piura province, in the region by the same name, and it is located over 3.5 hours from the city of Chiclayo, the capital of the Lambayeque region. <p>\r\nShe raises and sells animals, especially sheep, for a living. She raises her livestock in a corral in her backyard. She usually feeds them natural grains and grass. When the sheep have adequately grown, she sells them to buyers in the area. With the profits earned from the business, she helps her husband, who is a farmer, with the family expenses. <p> \r\nBlanca would like to obtain balanced feed in order to improve her livestock's nutrition so that they can grow better and be sold at a higher price. In order to be able to do this, she feels that it is fitting to request a  1,000 PEN loan from Edpyme Alternativa for the first time. <p>\r\nShe is a rather well-known and esteemed woman in the area, and people who know her consider her to be a calm woman who is devoted to her family. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":603776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase balanced feed for livestock ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-09-21T06:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanza Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":68.86},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":72.16},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":72.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":77.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":81.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":85.68},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":86.76},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":89.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":93.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":95.95},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":98.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.82},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.06},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.24},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.47},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.44},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.54},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.47},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.97},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.98},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.82,"local_amount":68.86,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":72.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099661},{"amount":54.3,"local_amount":144.79,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":152,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177555036},{"amount":29.13,"local_amount":77.69,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":81.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666552},{"amount":29.47,"local_amount":78.57,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":82.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409880},{"amount":30.44,"local_amount":81.19,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":85.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108312},{"amount":205.84,"local_amount":548.9,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:47:50Z","rounded_local_amount":576.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270447}],"funded_date":"2010-09-21T11:07:14Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:47:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":236849,"name":"Herlinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cMACHUPICCHU\u201d; este banco est\u00e1 situado en el distrito de Huanchac en la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

Salome is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional ingredients for her cooked food vending business. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Salome from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":662715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This amount will be used to purchase a fishing boat.\r\n\r\nThis fishing boat will be very useful, not only for her, but also for her son. He will operate the boat and it could provide him an income. She is hopeful that  this project will help her son to send her grandchildren to school.\r\n\r\nIf they are blessed with a big income, they will repair their house and she also wants to have savings for their future needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":703792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":6880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Sesame cultivation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Kolufifa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-12-10T20:08:56Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"K\u00e9ba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-25T19:04:09Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":775,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-03-23T04:51:28Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":11586},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-04-21T21:09:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13453},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:00:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16989},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:06:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17004},{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T20:35:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34422},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T03:56:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41442},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T16:58:15Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50178},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:21:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63310},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:25:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80006},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:30:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93752},{"amount":140,"local_amount":140,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T05:03:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106898}],"funded_date":"2006-12-11T19:04:09Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T05:03:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6581,"name":"Philomina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mina is a young woman of 22 with no children.

After 4 years with TYM, in 2000 she borrowed some money plus all her savings, they have built a 4 room house. In April 2007, they have built a 3 room extension to the house to serve as storage. This time she is requesting a loan 0f 650 USD to buy pigs for breeding and 300 chicks to raise, in time for the Tet holidays (new year, in Feb).

She is married and has two children, 8 and 13, both in school.  Her husband works for a taxi cooperative.  Esmelda gets up very early each morning to dive into selling her products--fish and various kinds of delicious shellfish.  They're expensive products but products that sell well because they are an important part of a healthy diet.  She's been operating the business for four years.  Sales are slow sometimes but very good at other times, Semana Santa (the week before Easter), for example, which was the time she began her business with money she had saved.  She didn't have a place to sell her products before, but with good advice and hard work, she managed to establish herself.  The requested loan is to buy a range of seafood so that Esmelda can continue to grow her small business and develop her business skills.  In the future, she hopes to improve her little shop so that she can provide better service to her customers.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Esmelda tiene 44 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en Villa Reconciliaci\u00f3n, es casada y con dos hijos de 8 y 13 a\u00f1os de edad que est\u00e1n estudiando, su esposo es cadete de una unidad de taxi.

She doesn\u2019t care about the pain she takes in the process of thread selling because she focuses only on the profit that she wants to earn. She successfully repaid her first loan from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). Now she is applying for a loan to buy more warm clothes and sweaters in order to sell more thread. \r\n\r\nShe is joined in her loan group by a few more members.

Roxmeri sells clothing on Sundays in Yapacani and the other days in the various markets in other towns.  She is very competent and her clothing sales already generate very good income, but also she has a lot of knowledge of this activity.  \r\n\r\nThis loan would be destined as operating capital in clothing sales.

After having done many kinds of work unsuccessfully, she got started in this work buying and selling kola, which she had learnt with her parents at the age of 6.  She operates her business at the grand marketplace M\u00e9dine Sikasso.  Kola (a fruit from a tree in forested areas) is a product associated with all social events in Africa (sacrifices, gifts as a sign of respect and consideration, etc.)  \n\nConcerned about doing better in satisfying her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso six years ago.  After several solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association in her area, she is on her fourth individual loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  She plans to use this loan to buy eight baskets of kola.  These goods are gotten from wholesalers of Sikasso and then sold retail to customers composed generally of the elderly and people organizing marriages and baptisms. \n\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the loan interest.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":270292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy some Kola ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":92621,"name":"Sirojiddin","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\n \u0425\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u042f\u0432\u0430\u043d.\u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442 35 \u043b\u0435\u0442 ,\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0418\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0443 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0436\u0435 2 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e,\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c \u043e\u043d \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u044c \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u041f\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 12 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0435\u0432.
