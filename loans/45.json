Marina and her husband go to the fields very early each morning, to trim their cacao and citrus fruit plants.

She also has the help of her sister in food preparation and waiting on the public, and pays her daily for her help.\r\n\r\nShe likes her job because it allows her to have income to pay for the household expenses.  In the past she had an accident that made it impossible for her to work in a company.  When she recovered, seeing the need to have a trade she decided to get started in this business.  Now she sees that it is profitable for her, so she decided to continue making her business grow and in time open a restaurant in her house.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with the MFP institution.

Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing the land.  <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Donatien Pierre K.  has requested a loan of 130,000 F CFA which will allow him to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing the aforementioned crops.  \r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":237859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T18:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Donatien Pierre","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821557},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357823},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046873},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938491},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396157},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":32500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":35475.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904034},{"amount":34.39,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-21T07:47:01Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126042}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T23:47:59Z","paid_date":"2009-08-21T07:47:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83156,"name":"Atsina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Atsina D. sells fish which she buys from the fishermen, bringing them home for processing and preservation, and then sending them to the market for sale, at Bantama near Elmina.

Judith was born on June 10, 1975 in Porto-Novo, the administrative and political capital of Benin.  She traces her roots to DANGBO, a village of OUEME county in southern Benin.  She has been divorced for eight years and has no children.  Judith rents a place in Kowegbo, an outlying district of the city of Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  She sells rich damask fabrics.  She is a seamstress by training, though she left this trade because it was no longer doing well for her.  She started selling fabrics eleven years ago and has a sizable number of customers.  She's thinking of diversifying her business.  She wants to sell more fabrics, some jewelry, and necklaces.

With five years of experience, he has a good command of this business, which he learned from one of his sisters. \r\n\r\nConcerned about satisfying his numerous customers, he decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso.  He is on his first individual loan and intends to buy a sizable quantity of condiments of different types.  Supplies are gotten in Bougouni and in Bamako (capital of Mali) from wholesalers.  And sales are made retail at the same marketplace, cash or credit accepted, to mostly women customers. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mr. Niar\u00e9 intends to realize a monthly profit of 26,500 francs CFA that will be used to expand his enterprise and to meet his family's needs.  He envisions opening a shop in the years to come. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

He is 42 years old, married, and the father of 4 children who are 5, 3, and 10 months (twins).  The oldest goes to school.  He attended 11th grade, but was not able to continue because he was drafted into obligatory military service.  He lives in his own house with his family, and doesn't support anyone else besides them.\n\nHe left Tete province for Boane to fulfill his obligatory military service in 1984.  After finishing his military career, he decided to continue to work in the Ministry of Defense as a driver.  Later, he married his wife and they secured a house in Bairro 07 in Boane district, where he lives now with his family.  He has been at this job for more than 24 years and earns a monthly salary of 3,300 MZN.  He uses this to pay for household expenses and he even saves some in his bank account.  \n\nHe has had loans with the Millennium Bim bank, but he later decided not to continue with them.  He found out about Hluvuku through friends who are also clients of the institution.  This is his 2nd loan, which has a value of 10,000 MZN.  He plans to use it to buy construction material (rebar, support beams, cement, sand, etc.) in order to finish with his work [building his house].  The previous loan was for 7,000 MZN, for the same purpose.  \n\nIn the future, he would like to request more loans to perfectly finish and furnish his house in order to offer better living conditions

However, she also keeps some products at home in case some of her customers need something she can sell them.  They buy these parts and products in Guayaquil and in Manta.

His salary is however too small to provide for his family and he is forced to have a business on the side. He is a very optimistic person and supplements his measly salary by raising cattle. The profit from this business provides the necessary additional income that allows him to provide for his family. Currently the prices of animals have gone slightly down and it would be beneficial to his business to purchase calves now. This will allow Djurabek to increase turnover, get more profit from the business and take better care of his family. The business also contributes to the development of cattle raising in the region.

The group was formed and they now work and obtain loans as a group. <p>\r\nThe women that make up this group have different businesses such as the sale of groceries, cakes, sweet dough, crafts, kitchen supplies and the sale of clothing.  This group is made up of 16 women who besides working to generate the majority of their family income are also dedicated mothers and wives. <p>\r\nThese women also work and have businesses with the end goal of improving their neighborhood of Valle Apua de Lambare. <p>\r\nThe loan that these women request will be invested in the purchase of ingredients used to make their food such as: meats, eggs, oil, flour, salt, vegetables, dough for empanadas, tapioca, bread, chickens, pastas, rice, etc.  The women who sell clothes would like to purchase: jeans, shorts, pants, shirts, t-shirts, sports shoes and lingerie. <p>\r\nThe women who sell cakes and sweet dough would purchase ingredients such as sugar, flour, lard, eggs, milk, \u201cdulce de leche\u201d, coconut, honey, etc.; and the craftspeople who make Nanduti would invest their loan in the purchase of thread in different colors, frames, fabrics and the maintenance of their sewing machines. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Cindy M., Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nEste Comit\u00e9 se formo gracias a la se\u00f1ora Castorina A.

Djalil is married and has two children who he is very proud of, since they are fighting to get ahead. With the faith that his children will go to college someday, he started a business 4 years ago, processing and selling dried apricot in order to make enough money to pay for their schooling. He is experienced in this kind of business, which allows him to expand his clientele day by day. Right now, Djalil is requesting $800 USD for purchasing more dried apricot to process and to sell. With your help, Djalil will be able to feel proud that, through much effort, his children can go to college and become educated people.  \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She works 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, and is assisted by one employee. Benedicta is requesting a loan for $400 in order to purchase long hair and a drier. In the future, she plans to open a second business. Benedicta thanks you for her support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":318096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase hair and equipment for a Beauty Salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-13T15:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":105728,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010848},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":105728,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233134},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":105728,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664925},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":105728,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105637},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:27Z","rounded_local_amount":105727.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022747}],"funded_date":"2009-05-15T11:24:33Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Barbara Barg","image":null}},{"id":111844,"name":"Falilatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"K.

With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise be unable to accomplish with their meager salaries. With the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, housebuilding materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayments and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nReynolds Lamin V., 62 years old, is the leader of this group of teachers. Reynolds was born in Sami Fulluma. He is married to a merchant and the couple has 7 children \u2013 4 adults, 2 attending secondary school and 1 in college.

She is separated from her husband and lives with her two children aged 16 and 12. She is a humble woman who is dedicated to her home and her children. She is a hard worker and, above all, she works to help her children study. She calls her children her \u201creason to live.\u201d \r\n\r\nMaria Delfina sells fruit in her shop. This loan, her third from FODEMI, is for the acquisition of more merchandise to sell. She wants to increase her working capital and purchase more fruit. She began her business twelve years ago when she moved from her natal village to Tulc\u00e1n. Since there was no source of jobs available at the time, she took the initiative to begin to sell fruits on a cart and joined an association of street vendors. \r\n\r\nMaria Delfina reports that her business is going well. She has fixed clients that buy from her daily or weekly, supplies good quality fruit, and gives her clients great customer service. Her past loans have improved the quality of life for herself and her children because when she has more merchandise to sell, she obtains more profit. \r\n\r\nMaria Delfina has many goals for the future. Firstly, she wants a larger place where she can expand her business selling fruits and vegetables so that she does not have to sell fruit in the street. She wants to buy a small bit of land to build her own house in Tulc\u00e1n. Finally, she dreams that her children will enter a university and study to be professionals. She was not able to attend university and she wants her children to have this opportunity.

She is raising two children with her husband. Tokotsun has been working as a seamstress for a long time and this trade is still helping her earn some income from periodically sewing traditional Kyrgyz wedding dresses. But now the main occupation of Tokotsun is raising livestock and produce sales. This business was started in 1992 with a starting capital of 5,000 som (KGS) and now it yields profits of 5,000 som (KGS) monthly, mainly from dairy sales. Tokotsun's family is currently farming a 3 acre plot of irrigated land where they grow potatoes and perennial grasses. In order to expand her herd and purchase more animals, Tokotsun has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS). She is planing to use the profits from a larger herd to plant beans on their farm. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":919632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Jar village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T18:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tokotsun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":883.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":441.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":883.33,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":40739.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938345},{"amount":441.67,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":20369.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862751}],"funded_date":"2011-11-17T03:17:02Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:17:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":362681,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victoria is a 31 year old married woman with four children between the ages of 12 and one.

She sells different products and articles for the home, like bed covers, cooking utensils, etc.  She does this based on orders and has been doing this for a year.  She started to sell things in small amounts, and now, because of her insistance and effort, her sales have risen.  She goes from house to house to offer her products and in this way leaves her merchandise in order to charge day by day and therefore obtain higher earnings that will cover her families' outgoings.  Andrea really enjoys her work, but the difficult thing about it is that it is very tiring walking for long streches each day, as well as the dangers that exist in the streets.  It is for these reasons that in the future she plans to establish herself in a commercial store.  It is her first loan with MFP and she is very enthusiastic about the work she is going to carry out with the communal bank that she is a part of.

This helps her family to meet their basic needs, which are expensive now-a-days.  \r\n<p>\r\nThough she earns PHP1,000 weekly, it is still not enough. Rosemarie is requesting a loan of PHP7,000.00 so she can buy more vegetables to sell in their village. This will allow Rosemarie to generate more income and save funds for her youngest daughter to pursue her college studies. \r\n<p>\r\nRosemarie hopes that her loan request will be approved.

Together with his inseparable fare collector they travel the streets of Juliaca, following route #12, to reach their destination.  What he most likes about the job is to amuse himself traveling through the streets.  He enjoys driving so much that he decided to be a driver for a transportation company as soon as he became of age.  He has had this job for three years and considers the hardest part of the job is to be sitting in his minubus all day and not being able to do all the other things he'd like to do.  With time, he'd like to own and administer his own minibus.  This is Richar's third loan with MFP and he knows that he must repay on time and is prepared to do so.  He is considered very responsible in his communal bank and he does not want to let the other members down.  The 2,000 soles requested will be used to change his driver's license classification.  The rest of the money will be used for minibus repairs so that better service can be offered his customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":427246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To change the classification of his driver's license.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-16T06:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":334.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843191},{"amount":233.1,"local_amount":666,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":669,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734781},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":334.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959845},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":334.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992690},{"amount":117.25,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":336.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717473}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T12:59:49Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":157117,"name":"Cerila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cerila O. is from the village of Kuguita, Mambajao Camiguin Province.

He lives in a large traditional extended family in the Koko borough of the sub-prefecture of Fakola, part of the Kolondieba prefecture in the third region (Sikasso) of the Republic of Mali.\r\n\r\nFor social reasons, Zoumana Konate prematurely quit school to pursue revenue-generating activities with his grandfather, whose occupation was the retail trading of fish. After years of apprenticeship, Zoumana decided to practice on his own the same activity as his grandfather, and has been in this line of business for the past ten years.

They live together in their own home which is located in the town of Santa Rosa.\r\n\r\nEven when she was a teenager, Aydee worked on her parents' land and also worked as a laborer on different farms.  With some savings that she had made, she bought her own plot of land and she has been working on this land for almost five years.  She has 3 hectares of land where she grows cacao and coffee.  The key to her success lies in her creativity and her desire to work.  She applies modern technology to her work with her plants because she receives periodic training from agricultural engineers.  Her most sought-after product is coffee beans because of the quality of the product that she sells.  As a result, she makes good money.  She normally works alone but at harvest times she hires laborers so that she can pick and sort her crops more quickly.  Aydee's future plan is to continue expanding her production so that she can continue satisfying her customers and improving her own living conditions.\r\n\r\nThis will be Aydee's second loan from MFP.  She knows that the loan money will be very useful to her in making progress in her work.  For this reason, she is once again very grateful to you all for your support.  Aydee will use the 2,000 soles that she has requested to hire laborers to support her in her harvest and in weeding her

Nivedha hails from Kulithalai, Karur district in Tamil Nadu. She is a 32-year-old married woman who works as a daily wage laborer in the agricultural sector. She has four members in her family including two children. <br \/><br \/>Monthly she saves only Rs.1,250 and the monthly medical expense is around Rs.750. She has no toilet at home or in the immediate vicinity. Her family is one of the millions affected by rural India's sanitation crisis. Without access to a toilet, her family is forced to walk a kilometer just to relieve themselves in the false privacy of dense bushes or isolated fields. The family members, especially their women & daughters are subsequently at risk of infection, molestation, and even insect or animal bites. <br \/><br \/>Joining hands with Sumathi & Revathi, whose families face similar problems due to a lack of sanitation facilities, she has formed a group of three resolute members, and is hoping to address this issue. Access to a toilet will mean privacy and security for Nivedha, Sumathi & Revathi and their families. It will also mean that they no longer need to walk long distances, especially when they are sick. <br \/><br \/>Hence, together, inspired by awareness initiatives, they seek a loan of Rs. 42,000 to construct a toilet at home.

She came to Kampala in 1995 when situation in Northern Uganda was not good to live in due to conflicts, which escalated to date. She left the village and came to settle in the Acholi quarters. <p>\r\n\r\nWhile in the Acholi quarter, she engaged in rock quarrying where she tried to squeek out a living for a long time and things were not appealing at all! Even working condition was not good since one is always exposed to the sunshine the whole day! Not only the sun was a problem but also danger of stones falling and wounding many who are involved in the activity of this nature. <p>\r\n\r\nLike Moses led the people of Israel from Egypt to a promised land, so is Life in Africa. She came to learn about Life in Africa foundation from people of good heart who introduced her and eventually joined as a bracelet maker. She is doing well with bracelets and also quite sustaining but this has not solved all her problems because where Margaret lives in Acholi Quarters she is renting - in spite of the fact that she owns a piece of land given to her by the king of Buganda (he gave parcels of the entire hill where the stone quarry lies to the displaced Acholi living there). <p>\r\n\r\nFor months she has been thinking of building at least a two-roomed house so that she could save her rent money each month. With those savings, she'd eventually like to build a permanent family house in her District, should there one day be opportunity of going back there some day.<p>\r\n\r\nMargaret has saved and 100,000\/= and has also recently started selling beads she makes from paper at home through the LiA CAN! export coop, which has increased her monthly income to a point that she feels comfortable servicing a loan.

His business is stable and is the main source of income for his family. Specifically, Akram grows onions and maize. During the growing season, Akram works in the field from early in the morning until late at night.

All of them need loans to buy raw material or wholesale merchandise.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esther Levandoski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3400,"image":{"id":377277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy raw material and merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3400,"lender_count":108,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cleofe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Nery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Crisola Magali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Sandra Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":" Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Yovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23535.33,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2139.58},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2139.58},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2139.58},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2139.58},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2139.58},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2139.58},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2139.58},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2139.58},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2139.58},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2139.58},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2139.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.09},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.09},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.09},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.1},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.09},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.09},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.09},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.09},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.09},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.1},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1630.64,"local_amount":11287.56,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T05:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":11365.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019310},{"amount":223.91,"local_amount":1549.92,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1560.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103863988},{"amount":309.09,"local_amount":2139.58,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2154.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110753709},{"amount":309.09,"local_amount":2139.58,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2154.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110753710},{"amount":309.09,"local_amount":2139.58,"processed_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2154.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118142663},{"amount":309.1,"local_amount":2139.58,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2154.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118142664},{"amount":309.08,"local_amount":2139.53,"processed_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2154.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118142665}],"funded_date":"2009-10-27T07:26:03Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:30:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Esther Levandoski","image":11830}},{"id":136499,"name":"Lilian","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lilian tiene 32 a\u00f1os, es soltera y vive sola en su casa propia.

She is a primary school teacher, and she works in a school that is located 2 hours from her house. She works as a teacher only in the mornings, so in the afternoons and in her free time, she takes advantage of her personal relationships to sell sweets (piononos, wholesome bread, and other types of pastries). She has been doing this for 2 years, and it has been going well. What she likes most about her work is that it keeps her busy, because since she was young, she has worked and she feels uncomfortable when she is doing nothing. Also, her business is very profitable; she orders her pastries fortnightly, delivers them to her clients and they pay her at the end of the month. She gives them the option so that they can collect the money and pay for many orders at once. Later, they can make more orders. \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP, and she is very happy with her community bank because she feels comfortable with her peers, since they are very responsible and friendly. With the money that she is requesting, she will buy more sweets, for which she will spend about 1000 soles and with the rest, she will build 2 rooms in her house so that she can rent them out and earn extra income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":387224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase her merchandise and build rooms to rent  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-12T15:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":374.85},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":396.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":406.73},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":423.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":442.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":456.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.68},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.01},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":262.13,"local_amount":770.97,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":777.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997489},{"amount":138.29,"local_amount":406.73,"processed_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":410.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842836},{"amount":449.58,"local_amount":1322.3,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1333.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734415}],"funded_date":"2009-09-30T21:28:58Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":140611,"name":"Khady","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Khady D. est une marchande sise devant chez elle dans un quartier populaire de Thies au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.Elle est ag\u00e9e de 56 ans et connait tr\u00e8s bien son domaine qui l'a occup\u00e9 depuis tr\u00e8s longtemps.

For Jofely, a rest day or a day off is the time she spends with her ASHI co-members. Every second, minute and hour of it is her most treasured time because she can learn many things about different aspects of life from the sharing time they have together. For her, knowing and learning to communicate and connect to other people are the best ingredients in making a business, aside from having business capital and other financial services from ASHI. \r\nJofely's husband\u2019s support is also very important in making her fruit and vegetable farming and selling business grow.

She is married to Eddie, who is also her business partner.  With her husband, Alicia manages the household and operates their business.  She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAlicia operates a food stall. In the Philippines, workers and most families only eat home-cooked meals in the evening because it is the time when all of the family members are home. This is not only a family tradition, but also a matter of convenience and frugality. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two people when it costs less to buy cooked rice and meat.  In addition to her food stall business, Alicia sells homemade snacks and pork meat for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 600 Philippine Pesos (PHP) every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she requests a PHP 39, 000 loan. She will use the loan to buy additional supplies of necessary items, like meat, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasoning. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAlicia hopes to grow her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":928438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Djidjoho of Hetin Sota, located near the hot springs of Dangbo. She also sells fish.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land. <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Marguerite C. has requested a loan of 110,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":237953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-02-11T11:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marguerite","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":27500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":29025.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357840},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046890},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938508},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396173},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":27500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":29025.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904051},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-22T08:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126059}],"funded_date":"2009-02-11T22:36:55Z","paid_date":"2009-08-22T08:03:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83220,"name":"Siimoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Siimoa V., 50, is married with 3 children.

of Chiclayo. <p>\r\nFor 5 years now, she has been selling freshwater and saltwater fish. Every day, she gets up very early and heads to her local fish market to purchase fish, then sells it at the market in the district of Pomalca, located some 10 minutes from the city of Chiclayo. <p>\r\nHer husband\u2014like the majority of men in the area\u2014works in artisan fishing. During the closed season, he helps Manuela out with her small business. They depend on these jobs to cover the daily family expenses, and they work hard every day so that together they can give their family the best. <p>\r\nShe would like to finish home construction and to keep investing in their children\u2019s education by helping them get some sort of technical degree. For this reason, she needs to request a 1,100.00 PEN loan from our institute for the very first time. She is planning on investing this money in expanding her business by purchasing more fish to sell to her customers. <p>\r\nManuela is very well-known at the Pomalca market. Her customers turn to her because they trust in the quality of the products that she sells. Her co-workers consider her to be a very active and responsible woman. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":377321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Santa Rosa -

She is divorced and has a daughter, 21, who is a college student.\r\n\r\nAbout four years ago, Dinara decided to become engaged in commerce. She had been saving money prior to her decision and, after saving some amount of money, Dinara invested it in purchasing goods. Now, she trades in foodstuffs and owns a small shop by her house.\r\n\r\nDuring these years, Dinara\u2019s trade has allowed her to live a decent life and even make a repair to her house. Her monthly income constitutes around $140. Now, her occupation lets her meet her daily needs.\r\n\r\nHowever, Dinara, aside from supporting her family, also has to pay for her daughter\u2019s education. The amount of the tuition fees requires Dinara to give at once quite a large sum of money, which she cannot do at the present time. Therefore, Dinara saw that the only decision was to apply for this loan. She hopes that this loan will enable her to save time and pay the tuition fee at once. Then her small business would allow her to gradually save money to pay it back.\r\n\r\nDinara has many plans for the future. Now, her only care is to give her sole daughter a good education. Then she is going to see her married. After fulfilling her parental responsibilities she is going to invest all her efforts in opening a bigger shop next to her house.\r\n\r\nDinara has three partners:\r\n\r\nElmira, 43, is currently unemployed. Her husband works as a tractor driver. Elmira has raised five children and the little child is just three years old. Elmira has applied for this loan to buy a calf to raise.\r\n\r\nMairamkul, 50, is a widow and is occupied with animal husbandry. She has two sons and the eldest son helps her  to look after the cattle. She needs a loan to buy a milk cow. An extra cow would allow her to sell more milk and increase her earnings.\r\n\r\nDilarom, 22, is divorced. She is sole supporter of her family which consists of her mother and sister. Dilarom works as a schoolteacher and needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\n<br>This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<br>Mol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sara's daily activity is making handicrafts from fabric and costume jewellery, and she is also an expert at making ornaments for Christmas and other important celebrations. This activity has become her principle source of income, and with the help of her sewing machine she offers well-finished garments.

He is 41 years old and lives in a common law marriage. He has two children who are 4 and 11 years old. Both children go to school. Antonio Pedro went to school until 4th grade and didn't finish due to lack of conditions. Besides his children, he also supports his two nephews who live in his home. \r\n\r\nAntonio was drafted for mandatory military service and served for three years (regular time). He moved to the Namaacha districted where he started working as an assistant at a carpentry shop. Due to his ambition, he decided to open his own shop at home. His best orders are beds, cupboards, doors, stands and tables. He has a monthly income of 8,000 to 10,000 meticais, depending mostly on his clientele. With his profits he started his construction. He hasn't been able to finish due to the elevated cost of materials and has requested loans from Hluvuku to continue construction. \r\n\r\nThis is Antonio's fifth loan with Hluvuku and second with Kiva in the amount of 25,000 meticais. He intends to buy construction materials (iron, bricks and cement) to finish the basic parts of his construction. The previous loans in the amount of 5,300, 8,000, 12,000 and 17,000 meticais were used for the same goal. He is very happy because he will move to his own home soon. He is also confident he will pay the loan back without a problem because he also has a monthly pension of 3,260 meticais.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna

She only reached high school, but with the determination she has to succeed, her poor educational background doesn't matter much. Mira is married to a driver named Benjamin and together they raise two children. One child is already in college, while the other is in elementary school.They live in Paliparan Site, Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite.\r\n\r\nRunning a <i>sari-sari<\/i> (variety store) is what occupies Mira's daily schedule. She determines which retail items are most needed and wanted by her community and buys them at the local market. She displays them on her store shelves in a way that will immediately get the attention of people in her neighborhood who might need a sachet of shampoo or a bottle of vinegar just to keep going with their busy lives. Aside from her sari-sari store and Benjamin's jeepney operation, they also raise pigs to meet the family's needs. Monthly, they earn around 10,380 Philippine pesos (PHP).\r\n\r\nTo help expand her sari-sari store, Mira applied for a loan of 8,000 PHP. She plans to use this money to purchase more retail items such as canned goods, detergents and instant noodles among other things. With this loan, she will make sure that her store will be capable of meeting the immediate needs of her community.\r\n\r\nMira hopes to see her small store grow into a grocery. Therefore, she goes all out to address her challenges and become a better entrepreneur. She wants to achieve this, because her main goal is to be able to support her family and assure them of a bright future.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":710999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To add quantities of retail items to her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-12T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1747.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814237},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1747.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256802},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2913.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123495},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.37,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2330.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194775}],"funded_date":"2011-02-13T08:40:48Z","paid_date":"2011-06-16T08:03:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":276636,"name":"Desideria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Desideria lives in the municipality of Sta.

Shermamat comes from a humble family and, from a young age, he helped his father in the fields, which is why he never finished his studies. Despite that, he feels fortunate to be with his wife, who helps him with their farming business. Shermamat cultivates tomatoes, potatoes, onions, and watermelons. He is very thankful for what he has and, thanks to the dedication and support from his family, he can have a dignified life and give a better life to his children. At this time, he is requesting a loan, which he will use to buy more seeds and fertilizer that will help him cultivate more produce. \r\n    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
