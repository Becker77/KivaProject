His hope is to continue growing and improving his business to offer a better future for his children and see them as professional, ethical and hardworking.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has worked selling bracelets, hair gel, door locks, chain bracelets, sweets, among others.  He and his wife had 4 children who are still in school preparing for a better future since the parents were unable to finish school for lack of economic resources.  Their home is very humble and little by little he has been making improvements to it.  With a previous loan he bought zinc metal sheeting and edging to replace the roof, which was in bad contidition.  This financing will be used to buy building materials like rock, sand, and cement to put up some room divisions so that he and his wife can have some privacy from their children.  His and his wife's life has not been easy.  She emigrated to Panama to work as a caretaker because she hadn't been able to find work in her own country.  His life hasn't been any easier either since he has to care for the children and work to support them; even though his wife sends some money home it's a big responsibility for him.  What he most wishes for is to be reunited with his wife whom he hopes will return to stay.  He is grateful to Afodenic because it has been the source of help to improve his small dwelling and have a better place to live.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":448632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy stone, cement and sand for home improvements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-14T23:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leoncio De Maria","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.66,"local_amount":1153.19,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1198.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841501},{"amount":113.28,"local_amount":2265.62,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2354.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874423},{"amount":55.24,"local_amount":1104.75,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1148.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604302},{"amount":56.61,"local_amount":1132.21,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1176.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639766},{"amount":140.76,"local_amount":2815.28,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2925.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561558},{"amount":76.45,"local_amount":1528.95,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1588.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204390}],"funded_date":"2009-12-27T22:12:24Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":166245,"name":"Madres Laboriosas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La alcanc\u00eda comunal \u201cMadres Laboriosas se encuentra ubicada en el departamento D.

She is 37 years old. Lilia is married. To make a living, Lilia owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a bakery. The main source of income for the business comes from baking & selling a variety of baked goods in the local community. Lilia has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lilia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lilia is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Lilia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishermen and small business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":369932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married and the loving mother of 5 children. Her father's hard and demanding character showed her, from the time she was a little girl, the significant value of work, and therefore she has been successful in various activities throughout her life. Now Nasiba dedicates herself to raising and selling the cattle and with the income she generates she provides a better quality of life for her children, who are her greatest joy. Nasiba asks for a loan of $800 USD to buy more young cattle to later sell when they are fully grown. With this investment she will be able to substantially grow her earnings and improve her quality of life. Let\u2019s support this dedicated mother's proposal.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He started this business as a coffee vendor in 2003, and he gradually added a variety of beverages and fried foods. Before starting this business, he sold merchandise door to door. This is his second loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and since receiving credit, he feels that he has made progress in terms of his income, which he has been able to increase. He is currently applying for a loan in the value of 1,300,000 Colombian pesos (COP) to improve the presentation of his business and to help protect the environment. He will invest the funds in purchasing equipment for his business that is currently in poor condition, such as a cooler, some thermos bottles, a blender, an orange juicer and a thermal display case. \r\n\r\nHis greatest challenge is to make progress with his business and help his family get ahead. He dreams of operating his business on a permanent site where he can sell his products, and having a house of his own, which would give him great stability. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She lives in Prk. Masayawan, Brgy. Dumarao, Roxas, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her gardening and vegetables businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,800. Liza is now borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she  can purchase fertilizers and use the rest of the loan as additional capital.  This will be her 7th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. \r\n\r\nLiza aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Specifically, he runs a sari-sari (variety) shop, and his primary source of income is derived from buying and selling items like bread, junk food, canned goods, shampoo, soap, and biscuits in his local community. He also makes and sells barbecue meats (pork and chicken). Johnny has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Johnny joined HSPFI to gain much-needed access to financial services.

Today, he offers English language training and translation services to all willing to master this language or needing the help of an interpreter. <p>\r\n\r\nGennadyi has a perfect credit history.

Porridge is one of the popular local foods; it is enjoyed as breakfast by almost all Ghanaians. It is prepared from milled maize or millet grains, which is boiled and eaten with sugar, milk and bread or eaten with what we call Kose. Kose is prepared from milled beans and it is fried with cooking oil, so in just 20 minutes it is ready to be served with the porridge. With a large customer base, she wants to use the loan to buy more raw materials like bags of maize, millet, beans, sugar and milk to increase production. She hopes to earn a good income to support her children in school. Mari belongs to a village bank called \u2018Yeda Nyame ase\u2019 which means We Thank God.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating a pedicab transport service. Lydia has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lydia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lydia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to repair her existing vehicle for better service. Lydia is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair her existing vehicle for better service. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Lydia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Additionally, Marta has ambitions to use the larger profits she will realize from selling more fruit to begin to stock a small fantasia (a variety store, usually with underwear, school supplies, cosmetics, and jewelry) that she will operate from her home.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Where Marta lives, her home is at risk from flooding when the river swells during hurricanes and tropical storms. Also, the house that she lives in has a leaky roof and weak walls. With the money that Marta hopes to gain from her fruit stand and fantasia, she plans to first improve her house with a stronger roof and cement walls. However, in the long run, her goal is to move away from the river to a neighborhood on high ground. She firmly believes that this is the right thing to do for herself and her husband, but, particularly, she wants her children to be able to grow in a stable house so that they will be able to focus on their schooling.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>This is Marta's third loan from Esperanza. She has successfully repaid the first two loans. Marta described how, at first, she was afraid to take out a loan because she was very poor and was worried that she would not be able to pay back the loan. However, after discussing the loan with her husband, and much prayer, she decided that she would take the loan. Thus far, Marta says Esperanza has helped her to expand her business and earn more money, in addition to repaying her loan. Now, she says that she has more confidence in herself and her business abilities. When asked what she had to say to potential Kiva lenders, Marta said \"I hope that they will lend as much money as possible to help people like me, because it has helped people like me to live a better life and give a better life to their children.\"<\/P>

She hopes to have no problems in paying the loan back so she can apply for others in order to keep improving her business and her family's quality of life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":398139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy basic food products for reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-10-02T18:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.56,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lina Armando","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":659.14},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":688.93},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":720.08},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":752.63},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":786.65},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":822.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":859.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":898.23},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":938.84},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":981.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1025.64},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1072},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1120.46},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1171.11},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1224.05},{"due_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1279.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.26},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.6},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.84},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.15},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.98},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.3},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.09},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":85.14,"local_amount":2321.92,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2342.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816793},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":1159.08,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-21T07:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1169.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938033},{"amount":4.34,"local_amount":126.43,"processed_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":127.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.29,"payment_id":128971979},{"amount":66.32,"local_amount":1860.8,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1877.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.91,"payment_id":136698576},{"amount":332.14,"local_amount":9531.77,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:30Z","rounded_local_amount":9618.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.36,"payment_id":151916003}],"funded_date":"2009-10-02T22:48:40Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Lucca","image":259290}},{"id":145609,"name":"Karina Selene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Karina Selene.

He is 49 years old. Martin is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Martin is starting a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling health & medicinal products in the local community. Martin is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Martin joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Martin is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Martin from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Ellos viven en casa propia, construida de adobe con techo de teja.\n\n\u00c9l es pensionado, desde sus 25 a\u00f1os de edad, ya que laboro para una empresa, donde se desempe\u00f1o como obrero de maquinas estiradotas, cumpliendo con la labor de deshilar la penca del henequ\u00e9n, para luego pasarlas a las hiladoras.\n\nEn los \u00faltimos 17 a\u00f1os, Jos\u00e9 se ha dedicado al cultivo de ma\u00edz, siembra normalmente 7000 metros cuadrados, produciendo 40 quintales de ma\u00edz (4000 libras), tambi\u00e9n, trabaja como jornal devengando un salario de $5.00 d\u00f3lares al d\u00eda. A pesar de su edad, tiene la suficiente fuerza para realizar trabajos de campo.\n\nLa compra de los insumos agr\u00edcolas y la venta de su cosecha, las realiza en la ciudad, esta se encuentra a cinco kil\u00f3metros de su comunidad, se trasporta en autob\u00fas y en la palangana de un carro.\n\nEl prestamos ser\u00e1 invertido, en la cancelaci\u00f3n de un cr\u00e9dito vigente en Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, y el resto ser\u00e1 para pagar mano de obra de la cosecha de ma\u00edz y pago de la maquina desgranadora.

They live in their own home, built of adobe with a tile roof.\r\n\r\nHe is retired. From the time he was 25, he worked for a business operating a sisal fiber extractor, which involved scraping the leaves of the sisal plant before sending them to the spinners.\r\n\r\nFor the past 17 years, Jos\u00e9 has cultivated corn, normally planting 7,000 sq. meters and producing 40 hundredweights (4,000 pounds). He also works as a day laborer, earning a salary of $5 a day. Despite his age, he has enough energy to work in the fields.\r\n\r\nHe purchases farming supplies and sells his crop in the city, which is about five kilometers from his neighborhood. He uses the bus or the bed of a truck for transportation.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested in paying off an outstanding loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Campo with the remainder used to pay a work force to harvest his corn crop and to pay for the threshing machine. Sr. Jos\u00e9 expects to harvest 20 hundredweights (2,000 pounds) of corn from planting half a manzana of land (3,500 sq. meters). Consequently, he will sell his crop at a good price since corn production was low this year. In addition, he will avoid having the corn stolen from his fields.\r\n\r\nSr. Jos\u00e9 has two lots and wants to build houses for each one of his children so they can study at least through high school, and can work and support themselves economically. He is teaching them how to farm and, of course, inculcating in them moral values such as honesty, responsibility and love for their neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":904429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to pay off an outstanding loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, with the remainder used to pay a work force to harvest his corn and to pay for the threshing machine.

She is 36 years old, a widow and mother of a 6 year-old son. Also living with her are her mother and a sister - she provides for both of them as well. Her father's passing when she was very young created financial difficulties for the family, and Virginia had to drop out of the school while on the 8th grade. Unfortunately, in 2007, after 10 years of marriage, she also lost her husband. Virginia makes her living by selling chickens, and a small variety of assorted articles, without help from additional employees. She is able to purchase these small articles for 80 rands (200,00mt) and sell them for 420,00mt, generating a monthly income of 10000,00mt. This is Virginia's second loan request from Hluvuku and the first through Kiva. She applied the whole loan amount of 15000,00mt from the first loan in her business.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Malingin, Bago City, Negros Occidental. She is married to Eliseo T., who owns and operates a machine shop.  They have a 12-year-old child who is currently in school. \r\n<p>\r\nLina and her husband are entrepreneurs.  Even before she got married, Lina already had her own general store, while her husband already had his machine shop. When they got married, it looked as if they would have a stable life, with both of them already having their own livelihoods. But sharp economic downturns can befall anyone. At one point, Eliseo wanted to give up his machine shop because he thought that he could no longer afford to buy the necessary spare parts for his machines and he was worried about the competition. But Lina encouraged him to go on and not to lose hope.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause she was able to spare some of her capital from the general store to help her husband's business, they were able to survive that crisis. That event opened Eliseo's eyes to the fact that, in order to grow, they needed to have additional capital. When he heard about NWTF-Project Dungganon, he encouraged Lina to join, which she did in 2004. From then on she was able to borrow money to use as capital for both the general store and the machine shop, helping both businesses thrive.\r\n<p>\r\nOn her 4th loan cycle, Lina expanded her general store and also purchased additional materials for her husband's machine shop. Their combined monthly net income from their businesses provides them with 12,000 pesos per month, which they mostly plow back into the businesses after setting some money aside for household expenses and savings for the education of their only child.\r\n<p>\r\nFor her previous 14th loan cycle, Lina borrowed 19,000 pesos and this amount contributed to the continued success of the family businesses. She was able to pay everything back on time and in full. She plans to borrow 20,000 pesos for her 15th loan cycle, so that she can buy more items to sell in her general store. She plans to use the profits to rent a farm so that she can increase her income even further. She has high hopes for the future of her child.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable.

He lives with his partner, Cinthya, with whom he has two beautiful children:  Rani, 5 and Amisha, 3.  They live in their own home in the Ventanilla district, north of Lima.  For the past 7 years he has repaired electric appliances although recently he has been working on vehicles.  Eduardo is passionate about his work and always carries it out with great pleasure but, as he says, 'It's not at all easy\" since it requires a great deal of precision and effort.  Happily, he does it with dedication and that causes his customers to leave his shop happy which, in turn, leaves him with good profits.  For the future he would like to have another, equally profitable business; he has thought of opening a hardware store so as to have a family business.  This is his third loan with MFP and he has always been very punctual with his repayments.  With these funds he will purchase some replacement parts that he needs for some of the vehicles that have been left for him to repair.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

He is 51 years old. Ariston is married and has one adult-aged child. To make a living, Ariston owns and operates a business venture in the food sector: operating a fishing business. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Ariston has been engaged in his business for over 12 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ariston joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ariston has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. Ariston is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Ariston from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from his business to supplement the income of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has had to go through a lot of adversity in her life. Nevertheless, she has always had the strength to get ahead, and to continue progressing with her family. She is a wise farmer, whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. Jane farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Eldoret, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. For the past 20 years she has been involved in mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been growing maize, cabbage, and tomatoes. She also keeps dairy cows. Jane has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has been making a profit selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Jane mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva lenders, to buy another motorbike. Jane is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge which has caused her to suffer many losses. Perishable products, such as milk, vegetables, and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market in order to fetch a high price. Through this loan, Jane is going to achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Jane feels relieved to know that there are institutions, such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical, because Jane will never suffer losses due to delay in the delivery of her produce to the market. She will also increase her sales volume, because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. This will provide her with increased income. Jane is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community, because she intends to employ someone who will ride the motorbike and help with farm work. With your loan, Jane will improve her living conditions, and assure her children and grandchildren to come of a secure future. Support a hardworking woman with a loan!

Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level), the cold, the difficulty of growing crops and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cVilla Florida\u201d is located at approximately 3,500 meters above sea-level, in the community of Huanchos, in the district of Paucarbamba, province of Churcampa. The main activities of the population are the growing of corn, potatoes and wheat, and also raising cows, bulls and sheep. In the small town the population have some shops and proviD. several services. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank has initiated its fourth loan cycle with 15 female borrowers and a total loan of 6,200 soles (about 2,225 US$). The loans range from 200, 400, 600, and up to 1,200 soles. The group already is in its fourth loan cycle, with one and half years of existence, and is one of the \u201coldest\u201d community banks is the Wari project. In the time with FINCA Peru the members have learned to save, be more responsible with money and in their business. They have learned to be punctual and to respect each other. The dream for all is to make their business grow and to have a higher income in future.  Most of the members use their loans for buying school supplies for the children or to increase merchandise for their business.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Sonilda Trist\u00e1n T.. Sonilda has a small shop where she sells marmalades and sweets with she buys in Huancayo. With her 200 soles loan, she will buy more things for her business.  Over time, with FINCA Per\u00fa she was able to save over 500 soles, which she used took out to buy herself a refrigerator. And her future savings she will use for making her house a little more comfortable and buying a television.  \r\n<p>\r\nAnother story tells of Flor Edith V. Trist\u00e1n, a mother of 2 children: one of 6 years, the other 3 years old. She has her business of raising small animals like pigs, chickens and guinea-pigs.

In addition to that she will buy materials to improve her home which is also her restaurant. \r\n\r\nAntonieta is very happy about everything she has achieved with the help of the Manuela Ramos Movement.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by James Lombardo, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":269295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase rice, sugar, milk, jars, ect. to be able to make the daily specials ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Bellavista - San Martin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-7.066667 -76.533333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-02-13T22:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":175.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20418186},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":175.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111652},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":175.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006844},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":166.99,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":176.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590497},{"amount":54.06,"local_amount":166.35,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":175.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52984795},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":175.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205236}],"funded_date":"2009-02-14T17:32:45Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:13:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"James Lombardo","image":66911}},{"id":92297,"name":"Lea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lea is 23 years old, living in with her common-law husband, and blessed with a 1-year old child.

Dentro de sus labores como madre  tuvo que buscar alguna actividad que no afectara sus roles dentro de su hogar  y con el tiempo tuvo la oportunidad de aprender de tejido y bordado que le ayudaron a ejercer una actividad dentro de su hogar. La mayor\u00eda de pedidos que recibe son para exportaci\u00f3n, pues trabaja, en algunas ocasiones, en la producci\u00f3n de chompas bordadas y tejidas de dise\u00f1os altamente apreciados por los extranjeros. Pero estos pedidos tienen sus temporadas durante el a\u00f1o, dejando meses libres de producci\u00f3n, y para seguir trabajando Elsa vende carteras o mochilas en las calles o a sus vecinas pues como madre y padre para sus hijos tiene la responsabilidad de satisfacer las necesidades de sus peque\u00f1os.

Since she had children she learned a variety of tasks to finish building her home, but it isn\u2019t easy to be alone, responsible for the needs of one\u2019s children. As a mother she has had to look for work that wouldn\u2019t impact her work at home and over time she had the opportunity to learn sewing and knitting that they helped her carry out from within her home.  The majority of the orders she receives are for export, at times she works in producing sewn and knitted sweaters in designs valued by foreigners. But these orders have their particular seasons throughout the year, leaving months of production open, and in order to continue working Elsa sells wallets or backpacks in the streets or to her neighbors because as both mother and father to her children she has the responsibility of meeting the needs of her little ones. Her wish is to open a store in her home where she can sell a variety of products to her neighbors. Tula has been working with MFP for 7 years, and this is her 13th loan. Along with her colleagues, they have obtained a wonderful friendship that is a reflection of the good work that they do as a group, as they constantly try to develop activities to help strengthen their communal bank. The money she seeks now will be invested in buying material such as fabric and thread that she needs for her products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":300631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Materials for her artisan products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-11T02:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":268.84},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":280.94},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":306.7},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":319.51},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":332.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.88},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.74},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.97},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.07},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85.87,"local_amount":268.84,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":270.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012420},{"amount":89.74,"local_amount":280.94,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":282.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596009},{"amount":93.17,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":293.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990273},{"amount":97.98,"local_amount":306.7,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":308.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211397},{"amount":102.07,"local_amount":319.51,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":321,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640905},{"amount":106.17,"local_amount":332.34,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":333.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080372}],"funded_date":"2009-04-11T05:19:00Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":104585,"name":"Sokhna","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Sokhna D., 54 ans est membre de banc villageois de Pout Diack depuis 6 ans et demi.

She has worked there for nine years. She started there as a janitor, then began to go to school. However, studying was difficult due to her economic situation and the best she could achieve was a promotion at her job. \r\n<p>\r\nMarithza is 26 years old and lives in neighborhood 380 with her husband and one-year-old son. Their house is livable, but lacks plaster, and interior walls for privacy.

The houses in this district are surrounded by a stream where ships with heavy cargo pass by. Her house is made of cement and has all the basic services. She is a single mother with a son of 11, who attends public school.\r\n\r\nSandra began her business selling typical foods of Ecuador four months ago, with the help of her mother, in a place next to her house. She sells chicken with rice, noodles, and her specialties -- rice with vegetable stew and all kinds of meat empanadas. Every day at 6 am, she buys the ingredients for the food in the market.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she wants to buy rice, tins of oil, and pots for her business of typical foods. In the future, she wants to have other locations to sell food.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva

is a married woman with three children whose husband is a truck driver.  However, in spite of that, his job is very tiring, it keeps him away from home, and he makes very little money.  In addition, he is losing a lot of time that he could spend with his children and attend their events at school.  Domitila isn't defeated by this obstacle and always tries to raise her children well and continue moving forward. Therefore, she looked for a job that wouldn't take her out of the house all day so she could be with her children so they wouldn't feel so alone and so at the same time, she could make some money.  This was how she started to sell shoes from a catalog.  Little by little, she has been looking for new customers so that she can contribute to the expenses in the absence of her husband.<p>\r\n\r\nLately, the situation in her house has become very difficult because her husband's trips have been longer, keeping him away from home for longer periods of time.  Because of this, she had to use her earnings to feed her children and today she has no money to be able to restock with new products to sell.  Therefore, Domitila is asking for a loan of $375 that she will pay back in in 6 months.  She will use this money to buy merchandise for the winter season.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
