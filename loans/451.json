While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing general  alteration & tailoring services and making curtains & basketball uniforms for local community members. Violeta has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Violeta joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Violeta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fabrics & materials. Violeta is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional tailoring materials such as needles & thread. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Violeta from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They live in the community of Triboline, an outlying part of the city of Sivia, where they have their own house built from simple materials. Lucila works in agriculture, specifically as a producer and seller of fruits such as pineapples, mangos, pacay [\"ice-cream beans\"], bananas and citrus fruits. She has been doing this work for 20 years. She recalls that when she had her first plot of land, she began to work toward her personal dream, since she had great faith, and because of this she succeeded. As soon as her first crops were ready, she sold them at the marketplace in her town, but she also sometimes went to the markets of other towns, and thus she became known among her customers. Now, she takes everything she produces to the city of Ayacucho, so that she can sell it wholesale. In this way, she is able to earn a good income, allowing her to pay the costs for educating her children. In general, she works independently, but at harvest time she needs help from laborers who take on the work of collecting the fruits. With the help of the loan, she will be able to buy fertilizers to improve the quality of her fields and later harvest high-quality fruits. Her plan for the future is to rebuild her house using solid materials, because she needs to provide security and comfort for her family. This will be her 13th loan, and she is very happy to know that she will have support from all of you. In this way, she feels secure in buying what she requested, and she is ready to make her scheduled payments on time. With the 1,700 Peruvian new soles, she will buy natural fertilizers to improve the soil on her piece of land. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":817866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy natural fertilizers.

He attended school until the 7th grade and was recruited to obligatory military service. He transfered to the city of Maputo where he continued his studies until the third year of Comercial school and obtained a house. In 2000 he sold his house and moved to the Bagamoyo village where he resides until this day. With the money from the sale of his house, he built another house and developed his water business. The architect's miscalculations of the structure caused the water tanks to collapse, and Albino lost his investment. Still, he continued with his project, and with the help of some friends, he was able to purchase a new water tank. He also came to know Hluvuku and asked him for a loan, increasing the number of tanks to two. With his second loan he purchased a pump with greater capacity and increased the number of tanks by one, subsequently increasing the number of customers. With the current loan of 1,200 dollars he intends to purchase more tanks and tubes.<p> He services 91 clients with fixed contracts, and another 300 people benefit from his business. He hopes to invest in other villages where the community suffers from diverse sicknesses due to a lack of natural water. This business helps him support the six people who are his responsibility.

Em 2000 vendeu a casa e mudou-se para o Bairro de Bagamoyo onde reside at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o. Com o dinheiro da venda de casa construiu outra e com o valor remanescente dicidiu abrir um furo de \u00e1gua para fazer face a escassez de \u00e1gua pot\u00e1vel que se atravessa naquele bairro. O mau c\u00e1lculo da estrutura por parte do t\u00e9cnico causou o desabamento dos tanques e perda do investimento aplicado.

Alex is married and has one son who is 10 years-old and goes to school at the local public school.

He worked for out of his home for a while but decided to stop because it did not pay enough. With his savings he bought a car and uses it as a taxi service.

Now she earns an average monthly income of 12,000 Philippine pesos from her business activities.\r\n\r\nPrincess N. is a member in good standing of NWTF-Project Dungganon, a Kiva partner. Her previous loan of Php 15,000 was used to fund operations of her food-vending business. It had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now, she is borrowing for her 17th loan the amount of Php 15,000, which she intends to use for her food-vending business. Princess N. is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").

Nancy is trying to change her life for the better.  She and her husband plant twice a year: broad beans, potatoes and peas, products that she sells in Tarma\u2019s wholesale market because profits are highest there.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes best about her work is to keep her crops pest-free.  She has been in this line of work for 7 years and considers the most difficult part of it to be transporting her product to market because the sacks are very heavy.  She is hoping to improve production to obtain better prices.\r\n\r\nThis is her 4th loan with MFP and she assures us that this funding will be very helpful for her to grow as a farmer.

She is hoping she can finish her studies and have a worthy profession which improves her quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nHer tenacious spirit and her wishes to accomplish her goals, have been the motivation to start her workdays at 4 am, when she goes up to the municipal market which is 40 minutes away from her home to buy the products she later sells. Her neighbours admire her for her sacrifice and her clients are very content with since her products are good and the service she gives them is the best.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause the home where they live is precarious, Obdulia needs to make a few repairs since the roof and the floor are in deplorable state and urgent repair is necessary. In order to fix them Obdulia is requesting a credit of $1000.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Luis L\u00f3pez Martinelli, Kiva Volunteer.\r\n<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Obdulia tiene 40 a\u00f1os, es casada y tiene 1 hija de 23 a\u00f1os.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not credit worthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. When a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback

They are one of the oldest most accomplished communal banks the organization has, and the members are very proud of that fact. They definitely feel a strong affection for the organization and vice versa. The group meets every 42 days in the house of Adela R. to get their training, repay their debts or deposit their savings. There is a happy and responsible ambiance in Adela's home, due to the fact that all the members of an accomplished history. <p>\r\nWhat they most like about working under a communal bank system is that, thanks to being a group of women with a good record, they are assured access to loans and avoid any red tape. They also enjoy sharing experiences with each other. With respect to The Friendship Bridge, they group feels its a good institution that is trustworthy, gives out loans quickly and has good customer service. They are also satisfied with the training they receive, among the courses the group highlights as especially helpful are business administration, medicinal plants, women's health and family planning, which is particularly stressed because it can have such an impact on their lives. Keep in mind that in rural areas families can become very large and as a consequence it can result in the families falling further into poverty. <p>\r\nSantiago de Atitlan is a place known for the ability of its artisans. The most beautiful bead-based jewelry in the region comes from there. By luck, this group has two members who work in this trade. They will invest their loans in the purchase of beads to make necklaces, bracelets and earrings. Two of the women work in textiles, weaving tradition blouses called \"huipiles\", while another member embroiders these items with beautiful birds, roses or Mayan symbols. Adela, a woman of strong character and playful at the same time like many women on the Guatemalan coast, sells snacks and American clothing. Finally, Karla R. has a cosmetics business. She buys her items via catalogue and sells them door to door.\r\n\"The Stars of Atitlan\" is a group that empowers all of its members. The members a group that has congealed over time and that works very well together. Due to this, it's imperative that The Friendship Bridge and Kiva members work together to support this group of talented, hard-working women.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n<P>Las Estrellas de Atitlan han venido trabajando con Friendship Bridge por muchos a\u00f1os. Son uno de los bancos comunales m\u00e1s antiguos y m\u00e1s cumplidos que tiene la instituci\u00f3n y ellas se sienten muy orgullosas de eso. Ellas definitivamente sienten una afiliaci\u00f3n fuerte con la instituci\u00f3n y viceversa. Las Estrellas se juntan cada 42 d\u00edas en la casa de do\u00f1a Adela R. R. para recibir sus capacitaciones y repagar su deuda o depositar su ahorro. En la casa de Adela hay un ambiente de alegr\u00eda y de responsabilidad. Esto se debe a que todas las mujeres tienen una tradici\u00f3n de ser cumplidas. \r\n\r\n<P>Lo que m\u00e1s les gusta de trabajar bajo la metodolog\u00eda de bancos comunales es que debido a que tienen un grupo de mujeres cumplidas ellas se aseguran el acceso a cr\u00e9dito y se evitan el gran problema de la mora. Asimismo, les gusta compartir experiencias de la vida entre ellas. Con respecto a Friendship Bridge, ellas sienten que es una buena instituci\u00f3n debido a que es confiable, entrega el cr\u00e9dito r\u00e1pido y tiene buen servicio al cliente gracias a la labor de la compa\u00f1era Maria Q.. De la misma manera, ellas se sienten contentas porque reciben capacitaciones. Las mujeres contaron que las capacitaciones que m\u00e1s le gustaron fueron las de administraci\u00f3n del negocio, plantas medicinales, salud de la mujer y planificaci\u00f3n familiar. Las clientes hicieron hincapi\u00e9 en la charla de planificaci\u00f3n ya que si les creo un impacto en sus vidas. Vale recordar, que en las \u00e1reas rurales las familias pueden llegar a ser muy extensas y como consecuencia esto puede resultar en que a las familias le cueste salir m\u00e1s de la pobreza. \r\n\r\n<P>Santiago de Atitlan es un lugar reconocido por la capacidad de sus artesanas. En este lugar se produce una de las joyas, en base a mostacilla, m\u00e1s bellas de la regi\u00f3n. Por suerte, en este grupo tenemos dos clientas que trabajan en ese rubro. Ellas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en comprar bolitas de mostacilla para elaborar collares, brazaletes y aretes. Dos se\u00f1oras trabajan con tejidos. Dos trabajan elaborando los huipiles, las blusas tradicionales de Guatemala, mientras que una se\u00f1ora borda los huipiles. Ella borda los huipiles con bellos p\u00e1jaros, rosas o s\u00edmbolos mayas. Do\u00f1a Adela una mujer de car\u00e1cter fuerte y alegre al mismo tiempo, muy t\u00edpico de las mujeres de la costa de Guatemala, vende refacciones y ropa americana. Finalmente, Karla R. trabaja en el negocio de cosm\u00e9ticos. Ella compra cosm\u00e9ticos por cat\u00e1logo y los vende de casa en casa. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Estrellas de Atitl\u00e1n es un grupo que amerita el apoyo de todos. Es un grupo que se ha consolidado a lo largo del tiempo y que han trabajado muy bien. Debido a eso, es importante que Friendship Bridge y ustedes por medio de Kiva apoyen a este grupo de mujeres talentosas, aguerridas y trabajadoras."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":157540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

She lives in a rented house with her little daughter and is willing to work hard to give her a good life.\r\n\r\nIn the comfort of her home Victoria weaves her colorful handmade clothing. She works every day beginning very early because she needs to fill orders for a trader from the United States, who takes her clothing to sell in his country.\r\n\r\nBut Victoria does not only sell what she weaves. She also collects a larger amount of clothing from other weavers, who in turn receive a fair payment for their work.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her work is that in some way she also helps her fellow women to move forward.

She lives with her two daughters, ages 13 and 10, who are students at the school in Ilopango and completely dependent on her.  Nora is a single mother and does not receive any financial support.  She sells detergents in powder and liquid form, as well as bleach for whitening clothes.  Nora sells her products door to door, which has proven very practical since she has been in this same business for the past six years.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting a loan because she wants to buy detergents, bleach, and toilet paper.

In order to increase their working capital, the group decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso  loan program where  they have their first solidarity loan.  Mrs. Korotoumou C. plans to use her loan to buy ten boxes of soap. She stocks up on soap wholesale at the Segou Grand Market and sells her merchandise retail, for cash and on credit, at home, door-to-door and at the M\u00e9dine market to a clientele composed of men and women.

Aunque ella acept\u00f3 la idea,  pens\u00f3 que era un reto muy grande dedicarse a este negocio,  especialmente   los s\u00e1bados y festivos cuando la actividad es de mayor movimiento,  pues en su condici\u00f3n de madre sola con 4 hijos se le dificultaba, pero de todas maneras  acept\u00f3 el desaf\u00edo y le agreg\u00f3 adem\u00e1s de la venta de bebidas, refrescos,  jugos naturales y fritangueria, actividad que   ven\u00eda realizando y adicionalmente tambi\u00e9n pidi\u00f3 a su primo que trabajara con ella   los fines de semanas.

She dreams of supporting her children until they become successful adults.  Luisa's household income comes from her business called \"Estadero mi Padrino y Yo\" where she sells beer, natural juices and fried food.\r\n\r\nA little over one year ago, Luisa's cousin, who started the business, went to live in a very beautiful place on the Caribbean coast in Colombia: La Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.  He suggested to Luisa that she take over his business, making her a gift of a cooler.  Although she accepted the idea, she considered it a very big challenge taking over the business, especially on Saturdays and holidays when things are at their busiest.  Luisa is a single mother with four children which makes things difficult.  However, she accepted the challenge and started soda, soft drinks, natural juices and fried food.  She also asked a cousin to work with her on weekends.  In carrying out her business every day, it has gradually become stronger.  She started the business in her home but currently works in her uncle's house because he has the infrastructure she needs: a cooler, a blender and equipment for storing the beer and juice.\r\n\r\nLuisa's dream is to diversify her business and increase her sales since her number of customers has increased and she doesn't have much capital with which to respond to demand.  Her biggest challenge is serving in her business since it is very difficult for her as a woman living on her own.  Her children are not yet able to support her because they are still young.  Luisa continues working to fulfil her dreams, making profits of no less than 26%.

Girlie is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Girlie from GDMPC.

Her daily activity is selling clothing and shoes, a business to which she devotes her afternoons, going to her clients' houses with the requested merchandise. After 15 days have passed, she begins collecting payments. She is content with her job, because it allows her to earn a good income and also provides her with free time. Therefore, she is able to help support her husband, who is a bricklayer. The thing that most attracts her to this trade is appreciating the diversity of the garments that she obtains. However, there is merchandise that she cannot manage to sell. Despite this, she has worked in this business for over 15 years. In the future, she would like to have a clothing store in her house, so she doesn't have to go out to sell her merchandise. This is her twelfth loan with MFP, and she renews her commitment to continue making her payments as she has done up to this point. In her solidarity group, she is a very responsible partner and concerned for the well-being and development of her activity.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJuliet is 39 years old and married and with four school-aged children. To make a living she owns and operates a general store. Her main source of income comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Juliet has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nJuliet joined ASKI in 2009 to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase products to sell. Juliet is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP also to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Juliet from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from her business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

As a mother she is very dedicated to caring for her children, and is capable of sacrificing a lot for them. For this reason she sells animals including rams and pigs. She raises the animals in her home. She has done this for 5 years now. In addition, she sells meat from chickens in a stall at the market in the city. Her home is humble but filled with the harmony of a united family. Her husband is a humble tricyclist who offers services carrying loans in the market. Often his daily income does not meet their needs. That's why Amalia works selling animals so that she can get a good price for them at the cattle fairs in the area, which supports her family economically. \r\n\r\nAmalia and her husband are aware that only a good education will be the reward for their hard work, since many times not having a trade makes it difficult to get a job. That's why she has made the commitment to offer her 4 children a good education that will allow them to be successful in life. At the moment her efforts are already bearing fruit which is why she wants to have more animals. This is her 10th loan with MFP. In all of this time that shes been working she's seen the advantages of being part of the village bank. One of them is acquiring the habit of saving which is very grateful for. With the loan that she requested, she will invest in the purchase of more animals and also in the sale of chicken parts.

He lives in his parents' house with some of his brothers in the community of Pucharini. Jaime gives his time and dedication to two activities; one of them is agriculture. In his parcels of agricultural land that his community designates, he plants pineapples, avocados, coffee, and bananas. On the other hand, with a truck that he inherited from his parents, he offers transportation services to the people who carry their products from their communities to the city of Pichanaki. \"These two businesses are profitable, because from the planting I obtain earnings every few months, but the transportation brings in money daily. The two work out well for me.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps because he has few responsibilities in life, Jaime has not experienced failures up to this time, but even so he yearns to have a family and children, whom he will support and care for. \"I feel that I can support a family and be responsible for it. It is one of my desires for the future, besides having my own house,\" he confess with some embarrassment. Through your help, Jaime will obtain his fourth loan from MFP, and for this reason he promises to be punctual in his payments and steadfast in the organization and participation in his communal bank, for which he feels thankful. If his loan is approved, he will buy fertilizer for his extensive parcels of land, which he calculates will cost 800 PEN.

These difficulties have rendered his working capital inadequate to purchase appreciable quantities of materials to sell. He therefore needs this loan to inject additional capital into his business to enable him meet the demands of the market. He wants to use the loan to buy an increased supply of raw materials so that he can turn them into finish goods for his customers and increase his profits. Ebenezer hopes to increase his savings to pay for his house rent. He is a member of the community group called The Voice Trust Group. In this group, members vouch for one another as social collateral to repay their loans. Ebenezer\u2019s picture was taken at one of his group meetings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":230719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy increased supply of polythene raw materials for the production of final packing goods.

Sanjar is 26 years old, married and has one child. His goals are to grow in his personal life and in his business activities by offering better service to his customers. His dream is that God will provide him with a long life so he can get ahead and fulfill his goals. He is a taxi driver and travels through the streets of Penjikent, Tajikistan in search of customers. He has owned his business for the last two years. Currently Sanjar\u2019s car needs repairs, and he wants to borrow $1,500 for 12 months. The financing will allow him to repair his vehicle and also buy parts he needs, including new tires. Sanjar thanks Kiva and all lenders who make this help possible.      \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is home to a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his two wives and his children in his own house in Sanoubougou I, one of the working-class neighborhoods of Sikasso in the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali.\r\n<p>\r\nHe didn't have the chance to attend school and after having tried several activities without success, he finally initiated himself into commercial activities and began a business trading in electronic appliances (radio sets, cassette recorders, satellite dishes, batteries, dish antennas, cell phones and similar products). That was over 20 years ago. Today he has gained such an experience in his trade that he enjoys a solid reputation among his customers and attracts a lot of orders, but he lacks the financial resources to fully meet this demand.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is why he came to Soro Yiriwaso and applied for his third individual loan. He will use it to buy 20 radio sets of various brands, 7 satellite dishes, 3 armor-plated batteries, 8 dish antennas and 180 tape cassettes. He gets his supplies in Bamako and brings them to his store in Sikasso, which is located at the bus station, right next to the office of the travel company K\u00e8n\u00e8dougou Voyage. His potential customers are travelers, carriers and even other people around his place, i.e. residents of Sikasso. He sells for cash and credit.\r\n<p>\r\nThanks to this loan Salif expects to make a monthly profit of 200,000 CFA francs, which will be enough to pay for most of his expenses, those of his family and the interest payments of his loan. He will reinvest the remaining amounts in his business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":429756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy electronic appliances and accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salif","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":63399.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763566},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":63399.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152397},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":63399.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991239},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":63399.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021509},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":63399.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746311},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":63399.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778863},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":63399.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961110},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:19Z","rounded_local_amount":63399.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699306}],"funded_date":"2009-12-24T23:09:52Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":158519,"name":"Puth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Puth S., 38, is a married man and the father of four school-aged children, one of whom is married.

As a very young girl she learned all the skills to prepare and fertilize soil for planting; she would watch her parents carefully.  Once grown, she has been able to use her learned skills to work toward progress.  For the last three years, then, she has farmed potatoes (Peruvian tuber).  Her siblings help her with this work and she states that she enjoys her work very much because she puts her experience to practice and her efforts lead to productive crops that she very proudly harvests to sell to wholesalers in the city.  Later on she plans to plant greater amounts so that her profits will increase.\r\n\r\nThis is her 3rd loan with MFP; she is very grateful to all the people that have made this possible because these contributions allow her to continue to work.  She also considers that the work within her communal bank is organized and unified because all the members are very responsible when it comes to repaying their loan installments.\r\n\r\nJoisy will use

She is single and has 3 children who work independently, but they all live together in her own home.  She is considered to be a mother who can succeed doing any kind of task.   Currently she has a business selling food.  In addition, she has a recreation area for tourists called \"Los Girasoles\" which is open every afternoon.  And as if this wasn't enough, she also works in agriculture on the weekends.  She has lands where she grows citrus fruit, which she later sells wholesale.  She has 25 years of experience in these activities, and what she enjoys most is to enjoy the tranquility she feels in the area where she lives.  Through her years of experience she has found that these activities are quite profitable, since they have allowed her to build her house, pay for the education of her children and live comfortably with all the necessities.

After 5 solidarity loans (group loans) all paid back in full, she is on her sixth individual loan, all of which were paid back without difficulty.  With this loan, she expects to buy 3 baskets of bananas, 5 baskets of potatoes, 7 baskets of oranges and other things.  She gets her supplies in the different weekly fairs in the villages surrounding Koutiala and Sikasso and makes her sales at the big market in Koutiala to a customer base composed of men and women, for cash and credit.  She expects to make an average profit of 70,000 FCFA per month, which she plans to use to pay back her interest, to contribute to the daily expenditures of her family, and to invest the remainder in other revenue-generating businesses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Martha Schmitz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":579841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kolondi\u00e8ba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":42385.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180833},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":42385.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476804},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:38Z","rounded_local_amount":42385.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613513},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":42385.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751945},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":42385.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606197}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T11:11:49Z","paid_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Martha Schmitz","image":489893}},{"id":224717,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is married with two children and all of them attend school.

She lives with her husband and their children in Hamdallaye, a working-class district in Sikasso city (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Four years ago, after having run several businesses unsuccessfully, this woman became familiar with a revenue-generating business, which is the dying of cloth, in Sikasso with a local expert. She enjoys a strong reputation in this business and receives many orders, especially for ceremonies (marriages, baptisms, holidays, etc.) \r\n\r\nBecause her own resources cannot allow her to meet her needs, she is requesting this loan from the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso to buy 10 lengths of white damask cloth, 10 containers of dyes of different colors, and 12 pouches of caustic soda in order to satisfy her ever-growing customer base. She gets her supplies locally from merchants supplying the raw ingredients (white damask, caustic coda, and dyes) and places them into the different dyes. The dyed damask is then sold, either for cash or on credit.

He is a resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines who works hard to continually provide income for his everyday expenses. Lolito operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Lolito earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling small quantities. His store is located adjacent to his house and his regular customers are his neighbors and local community members. Lolito earns a minimum of 300 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nLolito is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan to help continue to operate his business. He will buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand his product inventory. Lolito expects a boost in his business income as he expands. Lolito faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of his work and draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Gusti Ayu works as a manufacturing worker in a furniture factory, however her salary is not enough to meet her family's daily needs.

This revenue was deducted with money spent for pig feed for a 6 month period of IDR 1.4 million (around USD 175), so she earned a net profit of USD 387 in a 6 month period. <p>\r\nTherefore she is now decided to again applying for the 2nd loan from Dinari so she can continue expanding her business.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Like any single mother, providing security for her family is of utmost importance.  Mar\u00eda earns a living selling clothing for women and men.  She started her business seven years ago selling clothes out her home.  Using her own funds, she bought and sold a few quantities at a time.  Thanks to loans from AFODENIC, she was able to increase her inventory.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is now requesting another loan from AFODENIC to buy construction materials such as cement, ceramics, and sand in order to finish part of her living room to make it more comfortable.  One of her short-term projects is to have a store where she sells household items in addition to clothing.  Mar\u00eda hopes this will help her generate more income.

She has a business where she makes layettes and needs a loan of $2.000.000 (pesos), that she will use to buy fabrics, materials and decorations to make clothing and items for babies. \r\n<p>Emilce is a long-term customer with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation (Kiva\u2019s field partner) that started its business some 20 years ago because a friend recommended her to be a part of this organization in a group loan.  There they lent her $15.000 (pesos), for the first time and that is how she bought her first fabrics and developed her business from that moment.  While she was in the group loan, they helped each other mutually but now she has an individual loan.  Throughout the years with the foundation, her business has consisted of selling layettes, sheets, awnings, decorations for baskets, as well as fried food.  Now she is more into making baby clothing and a big part of her customers are pregnant women but she also has others that exhibit the products she makes in their businesses.\r\n<p>Through her business, she has been able to rent a room where they sell cell-phone minutes, a barbershop and an apartment that is rented and all are part of her current income.  She says that she chooses her tenants very carefully and now dreams of having her own apartment to have a personal space for her at the end of her life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She is 50 years old. Jovita is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Jovita owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Jovita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Jovita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 22,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Jovita is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Jovita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The different products marketed generally by the women are fabrics, shoes, grains, and a variety of consumer items. The women have been active in commerce for over twenty years. \n\nMs. Ndeye, who presents the women, is the president of the women's group of the association APEC -AL-OUMA.

The group's goal is to grow their profits in hopes of improving the well-being and the living standards of their respective families.\n\nAbout this loan:\nAl Ouma is a Senegalese nonprofit whose full name is The Association for Koranic Education and Teaching. \n\nOriginally founded to work with at-risk children, especially talib\u00e9s (young boys from poor families who beg in Senegalese metropolitan areas),  Al Ouma has evolved its mission to work with adults as well as children.   They currently have over 10,000 members, and are actively engaged in supporting the economic development of their members in the hopes of improving their quality of life, and that of their at-risk children.\n\nAl Ouma's members are currently organized into smaller associations which meet each week to contribute to a group fund that helps finance small loans for members.  Members typically put in $2 USD per week.  Because UIMCEC and Al Ouma both share the mission of fighting poverty through economic empowerment, they have formed a partnership to provide loans to Al Ouma associations at a lower interest rate than UIMCEC usually offers its clients.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4725,"image":{"id":722456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increasing
