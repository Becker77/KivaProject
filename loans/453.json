She and other businessmen are looking into building attractive shops out of wood, but in the meantime every weekend she prepares various dishes, and along with cases of drinks, transports them from her home in pots covered with paper and plastic so that they do not get cold, but stay hot. Alida has been preparing 15 to 20 meals, and for each traditional meal charges six Peruvian soles.  Although she does not earn much, at this price she can be competitive and familiarize herself with the locale.  Once the area opens to the public she hopes to recover her investment. Alida is the president of her MFP banco comunal, a business support group, and she instills in all the members the value of attending and making their loan payments on time.  She continues to facilitate loans for the group in this fashion.

Josefa owns a small shop which has the great advantage of being the only one in the area, so the neighbors only patronize her shop. Josefa is requesting a loan that she will invest in her business, purchasing staple grains and items of personal use like soap and toilet paper. Josefa would like to be able to expand her store, so that it will be visited not just by nearby neighbors but also by people who live farther away.

Her oldest son is now 31 years old and youngest daughter is only nine. Nurbubu and her husband are farmers. They breed small cattle in specialized sheds for keeping cattle which are known as \"kashars.\" Their kashar is in the suburb of Balykchi. Nurbubu is happy that she has grown so many children. Because all of them are actively helping their parents and by that contribute to their family business. They started with just keeping the cattle at their home. In a short period of time they managed to increase the headcount of cattle and they soon need a large space which they successfully found. Animal husbandry has become a golden niche for Nurbubu because thanks to this business Nurbubu and her husband have significantly improved their quality of life. Firstly, they have married their son without any difficulties, celebrated his wedding and bought him a car. All the expenses were covered by the profit made from selling cattle. Nurbubu is fifty two years old, but even now she works very hard every day and gives her soul to the growth of their business. Their starting capital included around fifteen thousand soms. Right now they can already make the third of this amount in one month. Nurbubu has decided to ask for a loan with the purpose to buy fodder for the winter time. This will allow her to successfully feed the cattle until the spring. Nurbubu very much wants to pay off the kashar in the next two years. She is ready to do everything she can to achieve it. \r\n\r\nNurbubu's group partners are: Abdykadyr, Aigul, Bermetkan and Anara.\r\n\r\nAbdykadyr is sixty six years old. He is married and is a father of two children. To feed the family he breeds small cattle in the kashar. Abdykadyr needs a loan to prepare the fodder for the winter.\r\n\r\nAigul is forty eight years old. She is a mother of two children. Aigul is a housewife. Her husband transports and sells coal. He also works as a driver on the glass factory every fifteen days. Aigul needs a loan to pay her daughter's college tuition.\r\n\r\nBermetkan is forty nine years old. She is has an only daughter. Bermetkan breeds small cattle and her husband works in construction. With the help of the loan Bermetkan plans to buy fodder for the cattle for the winter.\r\n\r\nAnara is forty years old. Four years ago Anara decided to start a business. She started selling gum, seeds, nuts and tobacco products. Her husband is already involved in her business. Anara needs a loan to increase her circulation of merchandise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

This community bank is characterized by being very united and happy. Se\u00f1ora Mery Martha is the president and sells groceries in a shop in the market. She is married, and she and her husband, Juan, have three children of school age. Her husband works in metal finishing and has his own shop in their home in the city of El Alto in order to maintain their family. They live in a little house that belongs to their parents. The expectations of Se\u00f1ora Mery Martha and her husband are to grow little by little and be able to buy themselves a piece of land of their own and become independent to give greater comfort to their children.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group works in different activities, the majority in clothing sales, either as traveling vendors or at fixed shops. Some members have a little internet cafe, others sell food, others sell blankets, have a photocopying service, or work in public transport. \r\n\r\nThe group in general has sufficient experience in the businesses they operate, and it's for this reason that they are known in the markets where they sell their products, and thus competition does not affect them too much. The present loan will be used as operating capital for the purchase of merchandise, ingredients, and materials to improve their businesses and give their families a better quality of life. The expectation of the group is to continue working and counting, above all, on the confidence and economic support of Agrocapital to be able to reach their goals, since they are in their fifth loan

The name comes from the actual place where the members of  the group meet, which happens to be the business site belonging to Mrs. Claudia C. C., who acts as the representative for her colleagues.  The meetings take place outside where the rising sun can be seen every morning.\r\n\r\nIn this narrative we will talk about Martha Iris Nicol\u00e1s Ram\u00edrez who is 31 years old and the mother of four children.  Her husband is 29 years old and is a bricklayer.  Her small children are Denis, who is 13 years old and in the 6th grade, Axel who is 11 and in 5th grade, Irais who is 8 and Jes\u00fas who is 3 years old.  Martha has been making and selling crafts for over a year.  Before she worked in a store and didn't have enough time to look after her children the way she wanted to but with her current job she can.  Martha sells all kinds of articles for children's parties and events.  She sells pi\u00f1atas, toys, baby clothes and souvenirs.\r\n\r\nMartha became a member of the group so she could request a loan to buy more items and materials for her business, such as pi\u00f1atas, baby bottles, pacifiers, rattles, baby caps, dolls, doll buggies, photo frames, tea sets for little girls, action figures, diaper bags, balls and materials for handicrafts and souvenirs.  Martha's business is doing well and sales increased in December thanks to the traditional nativity scenes and celebrations carried out in the town.  Also there was more activity around the Epiphany dates as parents were buying toys for children.  Martha usually stocks her business depending on the season and on customer demand.\r\n\r\nMartha uses her earnings to buy more goods and to pay back her loan.  Her business has improved greatly.\r\n\r\nOne of Martha's big dreams is to expand her business, make improvements in merchandise, and hire someone to help her out with customer service.  She also wants to buy her own home since she now lives with her in-laws.\r\n\r\nMartha hopes to see her children grow into good citizens who help others in need.  She wants to see them happy and nurtured in love and affection, growing up in a healthy, harmonious atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThanks to Kiva these dreams can come true; and thanks to institutions like the Foundation, those who have less can receive a gesture of support and service.  The women from the Oaxaca coast feel supported by this great team.\r\n\r\nThe \"Frente al sol\" group is comprised of 10 ladies who work very hard to carve out a future for their children.  They are responsible, hard-working women who are very committed to their families and society.  These are the names of each member of the group and their individual activity.\r\n\r\nClaudia C.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling canned goods, snack foods, shampoo, soap, and beverages in the local community. Ailene has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ailene joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ailene has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. Ailene is requesting a new loan for 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods, beverages, and snack foods. This loan will be Ailene's fourth loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She may tie it up there or may hang out with it all day so the it can eat enough to grow into a full blown bull to sell for the meat: She hopes to sell the bull for up to Q4000 ($525) Maria is a widow and lives with her daughter.

She earns her living by buying and selling dried fish.  <p>\r\n\r\nZita joined Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF)-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of two previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and through her hard work, Zita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan in the amount of 8,000 PHP enabled her to earn a monthly profit of 8,000 PHP, which helped to improve her family's standard of living.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 3rd cycle loan, she is seeking to borrow a loan in the amount of 13,000 PHP ($300), which she intends to use to buy an additional stock of dried fish. In turn, she hopes to continue to save up to expand her business.

She lives with her family in the settlement of Jes\u00fas del Valle \u2013 Valle de los Incas, a rural zone within the agricultural district of Tambogrande. The area produces fruits for export and lies in the province of Piura, in the region of the same name, situated more than three hours from the city of Chiclayo, the capital of the Lambayeque region.\r\n\r\nSince she got married, Julia has worked raising and selling animals. She raises small animals such as poultry and sheep in enclosures located near her home. Once the animals have reached a good stage of development, she offers them for sale to traders who regularly frequent the area where she lives. In addition, she also makes and sells chicha (a typical beverage of the region, made from a base of corn flour) in her home. \r\n\r\nWith the income she receives from this work, she helps her husband, who is a farmer, with the family's expenses. She would like to improve the nutrition of her animals so that she can obtain a higher income when she sells them. To achieve her objective, she plans to buy balanced animal feed, and for this reason she has requested a loan for the first time from Edpyme Alternativa, in the amount of 800 Peruvian new soles.\r\n\r\nJulia is a cheerful and responsible woman. Her greatest desire is to keep working to help her husband and provide her children with a better quality of life. In the area where she lives, her neighbors and others who know her consider her a steady and trustworthy woman. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":587663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buying balanced feed to improve the nutrition of the small animals she raises for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande -

This loan of Kshs 40,000 is Janet's second loan with KADET. The first loan was paid well and in time. She plans to use Kshs 20,000 to increase her stocks of clothes for resale and Kshs 20,000 to open another boutique. If the loan boosts the business, Janet will buy food and clothing for her children, which has been a challenge in her life. She will also pay school fees for her daughter.\r\n\r\nJanet describes herself as bright and enterprising. She dreams of building her own business premises and her own home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":654123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

His previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped him earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for his 11th loan, he is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase feed, hogs & fertilizers so that he can to save up for his children's education and family needs.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Keadaan kamarnya sangat sederhana, tetapi lingkungannya cukup sehat. Sudah sekitar 5 tahun yang lalu klien memulai usaha ini, dan sampai sekarang masih bertahan. Selain karena tidak memiliki usaha yang lain, juga karena tidak memiliki modal untuk memulai usaha yang lain. Setiap harinya, mulai dari pagi sampai sore hari, Busairi harus berkeliling di sekitar wilayah Tuban untuk mencari dan membeli rongsongan. Dia hanya beristirahat pada saat makan siang. Setelah seharian bekerja, hasil yang didapatnya dibawa ke tempat pengumpulan barang rongsokan untuk kemudian ditimbang dan dijual.

He has land in which he as grown rice before with good results, which is why he wants to grow more. Thanks to this type of business he has considerably improved his family's quality of life.

They are a very humble but hard-working family.  They have three independent children.  For the past 22 years he has farmed pineapple.  However, due to the prevailing draught conditions, crop yields have been poor.  They are requesting funding to buy agricultural supplies, like fertilizers and pesticides, that will help them produce better crops.   This will be of great help in that they will be able to produce a top quality crop to sell at a good price.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nFrancisco is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, he plants and harvests a variety of vegetables to sell. Francisco has been engaged in his business for over fifteen years and earns approximately $155 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Francisco joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation by engaging in business activities. He is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be his 1st loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Jos\u00e9 is a dreamer and a visionary, having studied dentistry at university with the hope of being able to offer help to others who may need it.  This wish of his led Jos\u00e9 to open his own dental practice 2 years ago, setting up an office within his own house.  \r\nJose requests a loan through which he would be able to have sufficient money to invest in his dental office, acquiring all the necessary elements to properly carry out his work.  He also hopes to use the loan he requests from Integral to purchase much more modern machinery, for the purpose of offering better services to his patients.  Jos\u00e9 hopes very much to put into practice all of the skills he learned during his many years of school.  Bit by bit, he has been able to expand his office's capacity for dental service, but in spite of all his efforts,he still has not been able to obtain many of the tools that he needs to offer a full range of high quality dental services.  Today, he sees cause for hope in the loan he requests, since the money he obtains would finally enable him to fully equip his dental practice.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  soft drinks retailing, motorcycle transport and farming. Her husband Fermin, who is 54 years old, works as a miner to earn his living.  They have 15 children who are between 18 and 42 years old. Merlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Merlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 to buy additional goods for her business so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Merlinda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Minda, as she is called by friends, reached only high school and fervently wishes that her children will reach farther than she did. She is married to Ronald, a vendor. They have five children. Two are in high school, another two study in elementary, and the youngest is not yet of school age. They used to live in Pangasinan, but at present the whole family resides in Libertad, Pasay City.\n\nAside from the profits of their tricycle operations which go to their family's needs, Minda focuses on her food stall as another primary source of income. Everyday she prepares breakfast and snacks as part of the menu, serving the customers who are too busy to prepare their own meals or those who stay on the road too long and do not have enough time to go home to eat. Minda has her own space in the community's public market, and she has sold from there for thirteen years now. Ronald helps her with the daily tasks. Every month they are able to earn around $320.\n\nTo help her expand her food stall, Minda is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will use this money to purchase necessary ingredients for cooking, such as cooking oil, coconut, eggs and brown sugar, as well supplies such as spaghetti noodles and macaroni. Minda recognizes the big help the loan represents in her business, as it helps her augment her family's needs with increased profits.\n\nAccording to Minda herself, daily sales become low during the rainy season. Another challenge to her comes as the result of her child's early marriage. This child of hers was not prepared to establish a separate home, and still lives with them. Minda prays that her child and her son-in-law will find a decent job to support themselves. For her other children, she prays that they would fulfill her dream of seeing them graduate from college. Minda wants to see her business grow and have good sales daily. She also dreams of having her own commercial space. \n\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":741337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

A. is from the village of Brgy. Mauan, Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya. He is 50 years old and married with four school-aged children. To make a living, Henry owns and operates a business raising livestock. His main source of income comes from raising breeding pigs. Henry has been engaged in his business for over 15 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nHenry joined ASKI in 2009 to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 34,000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Henry is requesting a loan of 40,000 PHP to purchase additional pigs to raise. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Henry from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from his livestock business to improve and expand his business.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the central and northeastern areas.

R. is a married woman who lives in the municipality of Brooke's Point, Palawan. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  vegetable and fruit vending and fish vending. Her husband Leonardo, who is 45 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 2 and 24 years old. Amelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amelia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

He is a farmer and also does tailoring and has a butcher business. He has been a farmer  for 25 years. Stephen bought his own land on which he cultivates his crops and this explains how hardworking and determined he is about farming. He has a big volume of customers especially traders from Mbarara which is the neighboring district and also locals buy matooke (banana\/plantain) from his farm in large quantities. With this Kiva loan, he plans to buy good farm tools, seeds, mulch, manure and to hire workers. Though lack of rainfall is a problem in parts of Uganda, the western part of Uganda receives a reasonable amount of rainfall. Ibanda district  is one of the districts found in the western part of the country where Stephen lives and farms.\r\n\r\nAgriculture in Uganda and the entire sub Saharan Africa employs the majority of the population and it's contribution to the the growth domestic product (GDP) is very significant. Governments in Africa including Uganda have  embarked on a campaign to promote agriculture in the region to fight hunger and poverty. The only challenge is climate.

Much like many other rural families, she and her husband fatten up livestock, after starting this business in 2003.  Today, Gulkayir's business has one dairy cow, five sheep, one bull and five goats.  Sales of milk, dairy products and meat allows her to earn about 8,000 som (KGS) per month.  Gulkayir is also involved in craftsmanship in her free time.  She makes pillows and blankets, which also serve as a small income for the family's budget.

The members plan to use the loan for various purposes. Mrs. Sory C. is the village bank president, selected by the members. She is 54 years old and the mother of four children, two of whom are laborers while the others are enrolled in the local school.  Her husband, Mr. Soeung ChansE., is a duck breeder. Mrs. Sory C. sells chickens in the local market. Since her business is going well, she wants to expand; she has a lot of customers and increased demand. In order to support this business, Mrs. Sory C. decided to ask for a loan to buy more chickens to sell to her customers. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. These borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor.

This group had the opportunity to attend elementary school, so they communicate well and are approachable in society. They started their own traveling businesses, purchasing items in Managua's oriental market and selling them by going house to house in nearby neighborhoods. Rebeca is a wonderful woman and she says she is grateful to Kiva partner ADIM for not only the loan, but also the ability to improve. She feels that the learning experience that she has gotten by working with ADIM has allowed her to realize how valuable a honorable and hardworking woman is. The women use their loans to buy items wholesale for lower prices and increase their profits. They hope to participate in training workshops to improve their businesses.

She is 48 years old. Amalia is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Amalia owns & operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fish in the local community. Amalia has been running her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Amalia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Amalia is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Amalia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her customers place their orders with her and she accepts payments by cash or on credit. The only problem is that many of her customers delay their payments, which hurts her because she is left with little available capital.\r\n<p>\r\nAlyeris stores her merchandise in her room, which makes it uncomfortable. She needs to have a location from where she can sell her products. For this reason, Alyeris will purchase materials such as stone, sand, cement, iron, zinc, and crossbeams so that she can begin construction. Thanks to her previous loans, she has been able to maintain the sales business that she started. With the support of AFODENIC, Alyeris will receive her eleventh loan which will help her continue making improvements in her life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She lives alone with her daughter and new husband in her own home in a neighborhood in the south of Lima. \r\n\r\nShe runs her own business selling groceries and staples in a store built in the first floor of her house. She has run this business for 16 years. Since then she has attended to her every one of her customers with a lot of friendliness because without them she would not have been able to grow her inventory and her profits. For this reason she opens her store at 6am until late at night. When she leaves to buy merchandise, her daughter is in charge of selling beverages. She always hurries home because they do not like to leave the business closed.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to have her warehouse full of various products.

She is married to a cocoa farmer and has 6 children between the ages of 9 and 25 years old.  Akua and her husband hope to provide their children with a good education and build a home for their family. For the past 25 years, Akua has operated a business selling vegetables and fruit.  Akua also manufactures local soap for washing clothes.  She will use the loan to purchase more vegetables and fruit such as tomatoes, garden eggs (or eggplant), and also buy more ingredients for her soap-making business.\r\n \r\nAkua is currently the leader of the group named 'Joy Trust Bank Group'.

Esther and her husband, Alejandro, are the source of support for their children.  They are both farmers who support each other in the field chores.\r\n\r\nShe has tilled the soil for 27 years.  She has a parcel of land where she has grown hardwood trees, cocoa beans and coffee, products that are typical of the Apurimac River Valley.  During harvest time she needs extra hands to help so she must hire day laborers to get ahead with the harvesting.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys the most about her work is harvesting because that\u2019s when she sees the long months of hard work rewarded in the quality of her fruits.

She lives in a simple home with her 2 children and her long-term partner. Her most difficult challenges were to raise her children after she became single (got divorced from her children's father) and didn't have a husband to help her with the needs in her house, so she had to start working for income and to take care of her children.\n\nShe says that her favorite thing is to take care of her children and to spend time with them at their home.

She has received and successfully repaid three Empowerment Credit loans. She invested these loans in her poultry, restaurant, and bar business. She used the profit from these loans to educate her grandchildren and to increase her capital.\r\n\r\nGiven a loan of 200,000 FRS, she intends to buy fowl for her poultry farm, buy drinks for her bar, and to buy firewood and stock some provisions. She strongly believes that this business will be a success because she has done it for a very long time and has a lot of experience with it. Other reasons for success are that she sells at a moderate price and has enough customers. The site of the business is also very good. Her business activity will be of great help to her community in that it will create an employment opportunity for N. and others, it will make some goods available for people around her, and will also improve people\u2019s eating habits.\r\n\r\nWith the proceeds from her business, she will feed and clothe her family and also increase her capital. She prefers a GHAPE loan because of the training she receives, the low interest rates, and also because no collateral security is required before loans are disbursed. The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":869962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fowl, drinks, firewood, red oil, and other provisions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

The profits from the business will be used to increase her welfare.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

Of her children, two are out of school and managing their own families while four are studying.\r\n<p>\r\nMariam's business is selling used clothing including bed sheets, curtains and nets. She has done this for 15 years. She transacts her business by moving from one busy location to another to daily markets around her home area. She buys her stock in bales from Kampala once every week and business is good. People like secondhand clothes because they are unique and long lasting unlike new clothes. From one bale, on average Mariam makes a profit of $50 and sometimes more depending on the quality of the products. Mariam intends to use the loan to buy more bed sheets, curtains and nets for sale. Her dream is to one day open up an outlet in the trading centre so that she can sell from one place while she hires someone else to do the walking around with other stock. She believes this will increase her income, hence more profits.\r\n<p>\r\nMariam will share this loan with the other group members."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":179981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more bed sheets, curtains and nets for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Gayaza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.916667 31.6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2008-08-07T14:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":108,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samalie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dezilanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-06T15:39:20Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1612500},{"due_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1612500},{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1612500},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1612500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1612500,"processed_date":"2008-10-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-07T07:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1615000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":350080},{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1612500,"processed_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:40:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1615000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5344343},{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1612500,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1615000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9966457},{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1612500,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1615000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14882657}],"funded_date":"2008-08-23T15:39:20Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T14:42:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rose Vines","image":111942}},{"id":60170,"name":"Akossiwavi","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Ms. Akossiwavi A. was born in Lom\u00e9 on February 1st, 1970.

She resides with her sister and children in Sanoubougou I, a working-class district of Sikasso City (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Having lacked the chance to continue with her schooling due to societal reasons, she was soon introduced to income-generating work, notably buying and selling bed sheets, children's clothing, Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), embroidered fabrics, etc.  She is in high demand by her customers (composed essentially of women) for the quality of her products.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about doing better in satisfying her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago.  After two solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association in her area (Association JEKAFO de Sanoubougou II) and two individual loans, all correctly repaid, she is now on her third individual loan.

Kurbon is an energetic man who has been a farmer for 15 years. He is happily married to a hardworking woman who always supports him. She has helped him get ahead in life and has given him 4 children. Like most other people in the zone who depend on the vegetable crop, Kurbon needs to buy agricultural supplies that will allow for the maintenance and production of his crops up to the optimum harvest time. With this purpose Kurbon applied to IMON International for a loan of 3500 Somoni to purchase agricultural supplies like seeds and fertilizer. Kurbon and his beloved family sincerely thank you for your support.   \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She tells us that it is going very well; she works on orders that her customers place in advance.  She attends to them with characteristic friendliness and charisma.  With this loan of 1,500 soles nuevos she will buy meters of fabric in different types and colors, tools such as scissors, thread on large spools in a variety of colors, needles for hand and machine sewing, pins and buttons.  Today she feels like a very accomplished woman, with a desire to continue to reach for her goals and make her other dreams a reality.

She lives in her own house with her husband William, who is 37.  They both wish to succeed in life.\r\n<p>\r\nAntonia engages in the manufacture of bricks.  Her oven is located on the outskirts of the city of Juliaca.  Together with her husband, she wakes up early in the morning to begin kneading and molding the clay before letting it dry for ten days prior to baking in the oven.  What she enjoys most about her job is selling the bricks, which is the point in which she feels rewarded for her work.  Antonio has been in this business for ten years and believes the most difficult part is dealing with the weather.  Many times while working in the sun, the work becomes more difficult.  When it rains, she is not able to mold the bricks correctly.  Nevertheless, she continues to work hard in order to improve her quality of life.  In the future, she would like to open a grocery store in her house because there are few in her neighborhood.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the third loan that she has accessed from MFP.  Just like her previous loans, Antonia wants to make her payments on time and with little difficulty.  She is highly respected by her Communal Bank because she is one of the most active and committed members.  With her loan of 3000 soles, she plans to buy new molds for making roofing bricks since these are the type that are most requested.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":476166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase molds for making bricks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-23T21:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124517},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960258},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993102},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717888},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751563},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934031}],"funded_date":"2010-01-23T23:26:08Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":175311,"name":"Folorunsho","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Folorunsho lives in Lagos State, Nigeria.
