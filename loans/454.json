This is 34-year-old Irene K. from Mbeya. She is a widow with three children between the ages of 12 and 18.\r\n\r\nIrene has been running a grocery business since 2008. A grocery store is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to, to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nIrene works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, seven days per week and currently earns about $120 a month.\r\n\r\nIrene is requesting a loan in order to purchase commodities in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to open a new business. Irene thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ABOUT SELFINA: <\/b>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":320475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase commodities in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T21:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":600975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773316}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T03:26:29Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":113049,"name":"Eric","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eric N. is married with two children.

Mariana has been engaged in this business for over 3 years.\n\nMariana joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mariana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Mariana is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Mariana plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Es por esto que Lidia, solicita un pr\u00e9stamo con el fin de poder comprar por mayor, el hilo que se utiliza para hacer las hamacas, esto con el fin e poder obtenerlo a precios m\u00e1s bajos y as\u00ed ofrecer las hamacas a menor costo. Lidia es una mujer muy constante en su trabajo quien desea poder mejorar sus ventas, ya que esto trae grandes beneficios para su familia.","en":"Lidia Sara\u00ed G. R. is 19 years old and lives in the Moraz\u00e1n department along with her husband and two-year old son in a rented house. Lidia works making hammocks in a variety of colors and styles which she later sells in the tourist zones of the Moraz\u00e1n department. Her job is very well-paid since the hammocks can be somewhat expensive because they are handmade. Despite this, she does not have steady business and does not always manage to make sales. For this reason, Lidia is requesting a loan with the goal of being able to buy at wholesale the thread she uses to make the hammocks. This will allow her to get the thread at lower prices and offer the hammocks at lower prices. Lidia is a very persevering woman in her work and hopes to be able to improve her sales since this will bring great benefits to her family. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Shimmin,

He lives in his father's house in a large traditional family with his mother and five brothers. This is in the S\u00e9bougou district of S\u00e9gou (the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Ousmane left school in the eighth grade of elementary school (according to the Mali education system) to work with his older brother who had a shop selling various items. Having spent two years there, he had mastered the mechanics of business. For the past three years he has been carrying out his own business purchasing and selling a variety of items in a shop in the Angloul\u00eame neighborhood. His shop lies close to Boulevard CAN 2002, a strategic business area of S\u00e9gou. In order to increase his working capital, he turned to Soro Yiriwaso, and he has had relations with this company for the past 24 months. After two individual loans which were repaid without incident, he is on his third individual loan with which he plans to buy half a ton of sugar and a barrel of (edible) oil. He gets his supplies in Bamako and locally from wholesalers. Mr. Ousmane Ciss\u00e9 sells for cash and on credit to a customer base made up of men and women. He expects to make a monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA. This profit will allow him to help his father cover the household expenses. His ambition is to diversify his activities and open a petrol station.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Joylyn has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Joylyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Joylyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Joylyn is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Joylyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers, and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Since he was a boy he has helped his mother in agriculture, as the primary agricultural activity of the family. Since then he has been in charge of cultivations. For some time now he has started to separate himself from his parents, as he has a family of his own. His primary activity consists of working in harvesting citric fruits, coffee, and to plant and prune the cultivation at a very important agricultural farm in the region. His work is from Monday to Friday, from the early morning hours to the late evening hours. But he is conscious of his needs and the needs of his new family. On Sundays he rests from his work at the farm and he harvests other agricultural farms to earn extra money. Thanks to his good work ethics, Jivann inherited from his parents-in-law a hectare of agricultural land where he is thinking on cultivating on his own account. He will also build a house on a small space given to him by his parents. He belongs to the communal bank \"Luz del Futuro\", meaning \"Light of the Future\" and it is the first loan he has with MFP (Kiva Field Partner).

She is a widow with two children. Her elder child is in college and the younger in high school.  She and her children manage their own household while operating a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one bottle of shampoo, a Php5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Susan gets supplies at wholesale prices and sells by the piece. Her store is located inside her house. At the same time she also manages an adjacent extension of their house as a room for rent. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 28,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of their room for rent. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSusan hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.  There, she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She is 49 years old. She was born and raised in a family of collective farmers. She is a very polite, kind and respectable woman. She got married early, and she has five children. She lives together with her family in a village. Her husband is a migrant worker in Russia. \r\n\r\nAnimal husbandry is her only source of income.

Valentina and her family thank and hope for your generous support. \r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Yael Schwartzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nLa agricultura y ganader\u00eda son dos de las actividades que desempe\u00f1a Valentina y de las cuales posee amplio conocimiento. \r\nLa dedicaci\u00f3n, empe\u00f1o y esfuerzo que les hab\u00eda consagrado  durante mucho tiempo, pas\u00f3 a segundo plano cuando su esposo tuvo un terrible accidente que lo dej\u00f3 inhabilitado por 12 a\u00f1os. \r\nValentina hizo que recibiera innumerables tratamientos a fin de que recuperar\u00e1 su vitalidad y deseos de seguir luchando, junto a ella, por sus hijos.\r\nDebido a este infortunado hecho es que los avances que obtuvieron con el trabajo conjunto, se vieron disminuidos y ahora a pesar de los momentos muy tristes por los que tuvieron que atravesar, han decidido iniciar despu\u00e9s de 12 a\u00f1os el proyecto de repotenciar su negocio agr\u00edcola y ganadero para mejorar la calidad de vida de su familia.\r\nA ra\u00edz de este hecho es que ella hace una solicitud de 200 d\u00f3lares para impulsar su prop\u00f3sito con ayuda de su esposo e hijos y se compromete a retornarlos en un lapso de 6 meses.

She is currently expecting a new baby and is very happy about it.  She and her family live in their own house.  She has always been entrepreneurial and in many types of businesses, but since her children are still young with another on the way, she decided 3 months ago to work selling beauty products from her house and thanks to her good customer care and persuasion abilities she has managed to obtain a large client base in her neighborhood.  Many neighbors and friends of hers come to request the products that she offers via catalog.

With summertime approaching, she expects these sales to pick up, so Yicer will use this loan to buy fruit and plastic bags for the ice cream, and bottles for the mabi drink, along with the roots to make it. Yicer expects her sales to allow her to expand her business and make it into a cafeteria. Yicer wants to see her children choose a profession freely, graduate and have successful lives in the workforce. \r\n\r\nPlease help us support Yicer's dream, along with the other entrepreneurs in this Kiva loan.

This is 36-year-old Salma M. from Mwanza. She is married, with five children between the ages of 5 and 11 years old.\n\nSalma has been running a caf\u00e9 business since 2008. Her business is called Caf\u00e9\/Mama Lishe. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces.\n\nSalma works at the business for twelve hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by two employees. She currently earns about 100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase potatoes and wheat flour. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Salma thanks you for your support!\n\n\nAbout SELFINA: \nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\n\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

With the 1,500 soles she requests she plans to improve her car port so as to provide better service to her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":410330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To improve her car port.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-21T00:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ludith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":251.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997697},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":251.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843070},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":754.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734648},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":251.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992577}],"funded_date":"2009-10-24T08:08:31Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":150059,"name":"Vianca Vanessa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Vianca es una mujer colaboradora y alegre, vive en la ciudad de Pucallpa, regi\u00f3n de Ucayali, tiene 24 a\u00f1os y es madre de un menor, se dedica a la venta de abarrotes en general, pues cuenta con una bodega que funciona en su casa, cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo que es jefe de almac\u00e9n de una tienda de repuestos.

He has water, sewage, and electricity at his home, and a paved road in front of it. His house is made of brick but he would like to continue building it. Jos\u00e9 started selling produce a long time ago after seeing all of his relatives prosper and become independent with similar businesses. Jos\u00e9 decided he wanted the same future. \r\n\r\nToday, Jos\u00e9 works at his store from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. seven days a week. He buys rice at $0.25 a Lb. and sells it at $0.30; soft drinks at $0.28 and sells them at $0.35 each; and oils at $1.80 and sells them at $2.20 each. One of the biggest problems is crime, which impedes the store from getting ahead. Sometimes, Jos\u00e9's wife helps out with the business, but to help increase the family income, she sells vegetables. They don't have any kids because they want to have a secure future first. \r\n\r\nWith the loan he is requesting, Jos\u00e9 wants to buy rice at $25.00 per \"quintal\" (46 Kg); oils at $22.00 per box; and soft drinks at $8.50 per crate. He would like to start another store and continue with his business to ensure a good future for his family and to finish building his house. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":449401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buying rice, soft drinks, and oils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2009-12-15T20:30:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Alfonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":960,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":120.24},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":129.6},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":134.65},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":140.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":143.36},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":155.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.12},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.62},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.76},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.46},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.6},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":124.03,"local_amount":122.12,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":124.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074050},{"amount":129.71,"local_amount":127.72,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":129.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910017},{"amount":136.76,"local_amount":134.65,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":136.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945582},{"amount":138.46,"local_amount":136.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":138.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673945},{"amount":142.35,"local_amount":140.16,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":142.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708108},{"amount":303.69,"local_amount":299.02,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":303.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891315}],"funded_date":"2009-12-24T22:57:19Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Violeta Rubiani","image":null}},{"id":166598,"name":"Comfort","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Comfort is thirty-six years old, is single, and has no child.

Salma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Salma is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods & snack foods. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Salma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":731497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional products to sell such as canned goods & snack foods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tambo, Hinaplanon, Iligan City, Lanao del Norte","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":128,"posted_date":"2011-03-15T15:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:14:30Z","rounded_local_amount":546.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201296650},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1365.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206164933},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211237540},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216516181},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1365.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221681470}],"funded_date":"2011-03-15T18:32:39Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:56:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":286008,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is 40 years old and married with four children.

product line that never ceases to gain regular customers is one that serves the food market. Sarah M., 62, banks on this fact and runs a food micro-enterprise. Sarah is married to Wilfredo, a driver, and together they have raised children who are now in college. Sarah is out to prove that having finished only three years of high school does not limit her in business.\r\n\r\nAt present, Sarah runs a food stall, called a \"carinderia\", in the Philippines. The carinderia is annexed to their house, so she is able to manage both the household chores and the daily routines in the carinderia. This business of hers has been running for 15 years now, and with the diligence she puts into her work and the quality training and spiritual support she receives from CCT*, Sarah manages to earn Php 15,000 net income every month. She has one employee hired to help her with the daily tasks in her carinderia.\r\n\r\nBecause Sarah aims to serve nothing but quality food to her customers, she decided to borrow Php 10,000 to better finance her business. She intends to use this loan money to purchase meat products, vegetables, and other nutritious ingredients to come up with daily sumptuous meals. With this loan, Sarah is also equipped to meet the daily needs of her family and pay for the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Sarah faces is the competition she has in the community, since there are not a few business-minded people like her who have set up food stalls in the vicinity. But Sarah is not going to give up the fight.

From the moment that she began to live with her husband, she began buying and selling fruit while her husband tended to the farm and other work as a taxi driver, and shen he had time they would together prepare fruit to send to Lima. Because of the effort they were able to buy a small truck. They no longer have the fruit business, instead they continue with the truck, working to transport cargo from the most distant farms to the city, and her husband works away from the home as a interstate bus driver. Raida tries to charge a modest price to her customers, she tells us in these times the demand for transportation has diminished, and she only makes two trips a day but there are months where things are going well and she makes up to 4 trips a day.  Raida is happy because she was able to rent her car and build a home in her town, but she still has dreams of having her home in the city so that her husband can visit them with greater frequency, because where they live now there isn\u2019t much accessibility. Previously she worked in the communal bank as its secretary and she did so with great responsibility, did she not neglect her payments and will not neglect them with this loan.

This is 25-year-old Vicki M. from Mbeya. She is single with 2 children, at the ages of 3 and 4. Vicki has been running a local restaurant known as \u2018Mamalishe\u2019 since 2002. <p>\r\n\r\nWhen you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.<p>\r\n \r\nShe works at the business for 5-8 hours per day, 7 days per week, and is assisted by her mother. Vicki currently earns about $80 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $250 USD in order to purchase more rice, cooking oil, salt and beans in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of goods for the business. Vicki thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

She is 59 years old. Yeyen is married. To make a living, Yeyen owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector selling personal home products. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling personal home products to tourists and local community members. Yeyen is just starting this business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Yeyen joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Yeyen successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Yeyen is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Yeyen from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Represented by their leader Anta F., the group describes their enterprise as follows: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe village of Elinkine is located in the south of Senegal 55 km from the regional capital of Oussouye, the capital of the department.  Elinkine is today one of the most popular villages in the region, or even the country, on account of its geographic position which makes it a very important and strategic crossroads in various sectors, of which fishing is the most famous.  This is especially true since 1997, when the fishermen of Diogu\u00e9 resettled in Elinkine.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe principal objective of the members of the Saxal Diam group is to improve their living conditions and contribute to the development of the village of Elinkine and its environs by producing and selling dried seafood.  The commercial activities of the group are focused on small-scale trade; this consists of buying and reselling various beauty products as well as dried fish in our village and in the rest of the country, especially the dried fish which is in high demand throughout the country and in the countries bordering Senegal [i.e. Gambia and Guinea-Bissau].  The members of our group will need a loan equivalent to 600,000 francs CFA [about $1175] for the purchase of fresh fish, salt, and knives needed to make the dried fish.  The working capital needed for the sale of beauty products will also be taken from this amount.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French: <p>\r\n\r\n\u00ab Contexte du Projet: le village de Elinkine est situer au Sud du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal \u00e0 55 Km de la capitale r\u00e9gionale et \u00e0 18Km de Oussouye, capitale d\u00e9partemental.\r\nElinkine est aujourd\u2019hui l\u2019un des villages les plus sollicit\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion voir du pays a cause de sa position g\u00e9ographique qui lui conf\u00e8re de carrefour tr\u00e8s important et strat\u00e9gique dans diff\u00e9rents secteurs dont la p\u00eache qui est le plus connu et ceci depuis les ann\u00e9es 97 avec le d\u00e9placement du village des p\u00eacheur de Diogu\u00e9 \u00e0 Elinkine. <p>\r\nObjectifs du Pr\u00eat : l\u2019objectif principal des membres du groupement Saxal Diam est : de part la transformation des produits halieutique et de leur vente parvenir \u00e0 am\u00e9lior\u00e9 les conditions de vie de leur membre et de contribuer au d\u00e9veloppement du village d\u2019Elinkine et de son entourage. <p>\r\nActivit\u00e9s : Les activit\u00e9s du groupement sont entre autre le petit commerce : il s\u2019agi d\u2019achat et de ventes de produit divers de beaut\u00e9, de poisson s\u00e9ch\u00e9 dans le village et dans le pays  ;en ce qui concerne le poisson sec qui est demand\u00e9 partout dans le pays et dans les pays limitrophe\r\nLes membres du groupement auront besoin comme fond de roulement un montant \u00e9gal \u00e0 600 000F CFA pour l\u2019achat des poissons frais, du sel, des couteaux, des coupe-coupe, pour la transformation.\r\nElles auront aussi pour besoin pour la vente des produits de beaut\u00e9 d\u2019un fond de roulement qui sera tir\u00e9 du m\u00eame montant. \u00bb <p>\r\n\r\nBackground<p>\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":6875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of cosmetic products and  fish-processing equipment; transportation of goods to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Elinkine","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.516667 -16.7","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-12-09T18:02:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-25T01:44:06Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1175,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":106,"local_amount":106,"processed_date":"2007-03-23T04:46:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":11580},{"amount":106,"local_amount":106,"processed_date":"2007-04-21T21:01:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13447},{"amount":106,"local_amount":106,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:00:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16984},{"amount":106,"local_amount":106,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:06:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16999},{"amount":109,"local_amount":109,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T20:35:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34421},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T04:03:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41453},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:04:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50193},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:31:05Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63326},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:34:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80030},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:35:44Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93770},{"amount":213,"local_amount":213,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":213,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106871}],"funded_date":"2006-12-11T01:44:06Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6577,"name":"Sophia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophia is 42 and mother of 3 children.

He is a market vendor from Dushanbe where he sells teenagers' clothing. Umedjon is very enterprising, has vast experience working as a vendor, and is full of creative ideas. A reasonable pricing policy and client-friendly service have always been priorities in his work and have helped to ensure the success of his business. Umedjon has been running his business for many years. In general he has about 6 years of experience selling clothing. Currently, he is requesting a loan of $900 USD to increase his inventory. He promises to repay the loan within 12 months. He believes that having this additional turnover capital will help him minimize his sales risk and provide stable financial support for his family. Moreover, it will help him get closer to his ultimate goal of purchasing a big store of his own. \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

flatbreads for sale. Every loan that Mahsud had with us he has used to improve his business (purchase of coal, a few tonnes of flour etc.). He is planning to use this loan to purchase a small batch of highest quality flour. Mahsud's flatbreads are very popular due to their excellent quality and appetizing looks. Every time we visit Mahsud we are convinced that his business yields a steady income and is very reliable.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":329544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of raw materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-06-09T15:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahsud","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T10:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":300.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215975},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:21:22Z","rounded_local_amount":300.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645451},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":300.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87085065},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":300.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001299}],"funded_date":"2009-06-09T18:44:42Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:26:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":117193,"name":"\u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"B. \u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb, 57, lives in the town of Ninh Giang.

He is 44 years old and lives with his common-law wife. He has 7 children between the ages of 2 months and 16 years, with different mothers. He doesn't support anyone else economically and is able to save 1000 meticals a month.\r\n\r\nWhen Alberto finished 10th grade he did a three-year teacher training course. When he finished, he went to a community 45 km from Namaacha, where he's been a school principal for more than 15 years, earning 7799 meticals a month. Since his salary is his family's only source of income, he's not able to meet all their needs and approached BIM (International Bank of Mozambique) requesting a loan to begin building a house, which he was unable to finish because of the high cost of materials.\r\n\r\nHe then approached another bank, ProCredito, requesting a loan to continue the work, which he paid back successfully. But because of the distance, he has now chosen to work with Hluvuku and has requested another loan in the amount of 15,000 meticals to buy construction materials and finish the work.\r\n\r\nThis is Alberto's first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. He will use the money to finish his project, since he's eager to finish his possessions are scattered and neglected. He is confident that he will be able to pay back the loan with no difficulty and then request another to build a wall around his home.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":380584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.19,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":681.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":709.29},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":738.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":768.79},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":800.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":833.27},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":867.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":903.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":940.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":978.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1019.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1061.04},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1104.64},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1150.04},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1197.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1246.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.19},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.3},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.47},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.08},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.9},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.12,"local_amount":681.29,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":690.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056861},{"amount":56.43,"local_amount":1472.19,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1491.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971817},{"amount":74.81,"local_amount":1951.54,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1977.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708936},{"amount":36.85,"local_amount":962.71,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":975.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.05,"payment_id":123937963},{"amount":87.95,"local_amount":2297.27,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2327.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"payment_id":123937964},{"amount":40.98,"local_amount":1186.18,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1201.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.49,"payment_id":128971950},{"amount":225.67,"local_amount":6448.82,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-18T07:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6534.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.54,"payment_id":151915969}],"funded_date":"2009-09-05T00:07:36Z","paid_date":"2010-08-18T07:43:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":137724,"name":"Y\u00e8yinou B\u00e9atrice","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Z.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Imelda has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Imelda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Imelda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. Imelda is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Imelda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

He is in a common-law relationship with Ayd\u00e9, his unconditional partner.  They have two children, ages 7 and 2.  Alfredo and his family live in their own home in the District of Palcamayo.  Every morning, he wakes up to the crow of the rooster.  He knows that farm work requires great sacrifice and dedication.  Alfredo grows healthy products on his land such as potatoes, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ulluco\" target=\"_blank\" >ulluco<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oca\" target=\"_blank\" >oca<\/a>.  He has some of the best land in the area.  For this reason, he is able to make instantaneous sales at the wholesale market in Tarma.\r\n<p>\r\nAlfredo currently planted approximately 25 sacks of potatoes of various colors (including white).  He will sell each sack between 30 to 50 PEN, based on the variety.  The ulluco crop will be harvested next August.  At the same time, Alfredo buys and sells mutton for 10 PEN\/kilo.  He earns around 50 PEN for each head of sheep.  Alfredo explains, \u201cI only sell meat when necessary.  If I have any debts, I will butcher a sheep whenever the farming does not do well.\u201d  Farming is a passion for Alfredo, so his goals are related to his activity.  He wants to extend his plantings and increase his production with each passing year.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be his 15th loan with MFP.  Alfredo gives his word that he will be exact and precise with his loan payments.  Regarding his Communal Bank, he says that he is very pleased with the work they do together.  Alfredo says that he will invest all of the money in the purchase of sacks of compost that cost 120 PEN\/each.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":930828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy sacks of compost.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-02T15:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455348}],"funded_date":"2011-12-02T21:30:23Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":368030,"name":"Amer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amer is a 19-year-old man, a freshman in one of the private colleges in Jordan.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Por las ma\u00f1anas iba a su colegio, y por las tardes se dedica a la siembra, esa era su rutina diaria. Su madre estaba delicada de salud y su padre comercializaba sus productos de cacao, pero dentro de sus posibilidades le dieron a Constantina las comodidades b\u00e1sicas que necesitaba. Es por ello que Constantina se esforz\u00f3 duro y parejo para sacar adelante la producci\u00f3n de cacao que sus padres le dejaron, ahora junto a su esposo labraron la tierra, para darle mayor impulso a su producci\u00f3n y con el tiempo rindi\u00f3 sus primeros frutos y de buena calidad. Posteriormente su producto es vendido en los centros de acopio,  d\u00e1ndole buenos resultados econ\u00f3micos; no contentos con ello decidieron instalar una peque\u00f1a bodega con la finalidad de ampliar su econom\u00eda, por lo que ya van tres a\u00f1os de muchas satisfacciones personales y emocionales.

She lives in the beautiful Cusco backcountry in the Palestina Alta community where they own their own home.  \r\n\r\nConstantina relates that her life has been difficult; as an adolescent she helped her parents with their farming chores.  In the morning she would attend school and in the afternoons she cared for the crops; this was her daily routine.\r\n\r\nHer mother was in poor health and her father was a cocoa bean merchant and they were able to provide Constantina with what comforts were within their meager means.  Because of this, Constantina has worked hard and fast to succeed with the cocoa bean production her parents left her.  Now, together with her husband, she works the land to produce higher yields and, in time, has had the first high quality fruits of her labor.\r\n\r\nOnce harvested, the product is sold to area consolidating centers yielding good profits.  Not satisfied with this, however, they decided to establish a small store with the goal in mind to improve their finances.  They have gotten much emotional and personal satisfaction from this for three years now.  \r\n\r\nConstantina would like to expand her store by introducing more merchandise into her inventory.  This is her 4th loan with MFP and she assures us that she will repay in a timely fashion.\r\n\r\nShe will use the funds to buy certain quantities of merchandise to stock her store in order to acquire

Feliciano and his family live in the community of Pico Central, 68 kilometers from the city of Cochabamba, so it's difficult to go to the bank for a loan. The family makes a living in agriculture, producing potatoes, broad beans and other items on their plot of land. Feliciano's wife helps out and takes care of the livestock and the children. Feliciano is requesting the loan to purchase organic fertilizer to plant with his his potatoes, which he believes will increase his potato production by two hectares because he has some uncultivated land. This will help him save money for when his children complete their primary education, since there are only primary schools in the area where they live and all the children only have that level of education due to a lack of resources.

poder estar realizando otras actividades, lo que no le gusta es que a veces las personas se demoran en pagar, pero siempre tiene clientes y lo bueno es que como ya tiene a\u00f1os en el negocio sabe a quien dar y a quien no, a Cherli le gustar\u00eda mas adelante poder poner una tienda da plater\u00eda y oro en la ciudad.Este es el cuarto pr\u00e9stamo entre Cherli y la instituci\u00f3n MFP, esta

1500 soles, ella comprara mas joyas, para as\u00ed poder seguir realizando su trabajo y poder generar mas ganancias e ingresos a su hogar.\n\n","en":"\r\nCherli, 37, is a very active woman; she\u2019s always looking for something to do to generate income for her three children\u2019s education.  She lives with her spouse and children in her mother\u2019s house.  \r\n\r\nCherli\u2019s work consists in buying and selling silver and gold jewelry.  She\u2019s also a clothing merchant.  She sends money to the city of Lima and the products she orders are sent to her from there and then she sells them among her friends and neighbors in the city.  She\u2019s been in this business on average nine years.  She works alone and has quite a good customer base.  What she enjoys the most about it is that it leaves her with time to do other things.  What she dislikes about it is that sometimes people take their time to repay her but she always has customers and since she\u2019s been in business for a long time she knows who she can give credit to and who she can\u2019t.  Later on, Cherli would like to be able to open a silver and gold shop in the city.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan between Cherli and MFP.  She is very happy to work with us and hopes to continue to do so.  Besides, she feels very comfortable with her group because they are always concerned about each other.  She will use the requested 1500 soles to buy more jewelry to continue doing her work and generating more profits and income for her home.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":858060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to get more jewelry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-30T03:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cherli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":224.97},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":234.27},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":245.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":255.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":264.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":275.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.49},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.9},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.97},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.57},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":168.39,"local_amount":459.24,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":459.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851246},{"amount":89.97,"local_amount":245.37,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":245.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666425},{"amount":93.57,"local_amount":255.19,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:15Z","rounded_local_amount":255.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621580},{"amount":97.04,"local_amount":264.66,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":265.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835655},{"amount":101.03,"local_amount":275.54,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":275.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245435}],"funded_date":"2011-09-02T18:14:35Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":335244,"name":"Cristo Del Consuelo (Cuenca) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal Cristo del Consuelo est\u00e1 conformado por 8 mujeres quienes son personas luchadoras, trabajadoras y muy alegres a pesar de las dificultades de la vida.

His carpentry business is done from this house, which is equipped with all the necessary tools to build furniture.\r\nHe proudly states that his profession provided his three daughters the opportunity to get an education.

Matilde J.

Both daughters are currently in high school and help their mother when they are not studying. Matilde is thankful for the help of her daughters, as maintaining her business and family has been difficult since the death of her husband in 2001. Mr. Olmedo died of cancer at the age of 45. This was a tremendous loss for the family and also left Matilde with the debt incurred due to the operations and treatment her husband undertook to try and cure him. For this reason Matilde works extremely hard to cover the debt she has as a result of her husband\u2019s death.<p>Her store, a small grocery, is very well-stocked and well-managed due to the time and effort Matilde dedicates to it. She sells rice, noodles, oil, sugar, flour and eggs. Having had this store for 14 years, she understands how to make things run smoothly. She has asked for a loan to buy articles of clothing. She wishes to expand her store to also sell clothing. It is her hope that with the summer months and added inventory she will be able to increase her sales.

She began her business with a small inventory, slowly increasing her turnover. After a while, Mavluda was able to save money and opened her own shop. In 2003, she rented a stall (in the picture). Currently, she has wide range of products: baked goods, which she purchases in the local bakeries and confectioners shops as well as soft drinks and juices from local manufacturers. The rest of her goods she purchases at local wholesale markets. Her inventory is worth $1000 and she is applying to KIVA with a request for a loan of $1200 (5000 Somoni) for 6 months for the purchase of her next batch of products. <p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from

She works at her business for 5-8 hours per day, seven days per week, and is assisted by two employees. Jessie currently earns about $100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan to purchase ingredients for making food. In the future, she plans to open another business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is 41 years old, married, and is the mother of five children with ages ranging from 12 to 23 years.  Only the three youngest go to school.\r\n\r\nShe has no dependents, and relies on the help of her second son in her work.  She manages to save 1,000 MT per month because they run their business in a rented chicken coop that costs 1,000 MT for each phase.\r\n\r\nRabeca left Gaza when she was only two years old for the town of Namaacha (at the border of Swaziland) with her mother, who went there looking for work.  She began her schooling very late due to their financial situation.  When she was in fourth grade, her mother lost her job and she had to abandon her studies and work in a state-owned company as a chicken keeper for five years to help with household expenses.\r\n\r\nYears later, she married her husband, who gave her funds to begin her own business raising and selling chickens.  This involves an average of 2x100 chicks in each stage, which she has sold both wholesale and retail so as not to lose her clientele.  Spending 14,000 MT in each phase, she earns 4,000 MT in profit when she sells wholesale to dealers, and 6,000 MT in profit when she sells chickens singly to local consumers.  But later, due to enormous orders for her product, she approached Hluvuku and Kiva, asking for a loan in the amount of 10,000 MT to increase her livestock (to buy more chicks and feed) and to satisfy the needs of her customers on time.\r\n\r\nThis is Rabeca's third loan with Hluvuku and her first loan with Kiva.  The first loan of 9,200 MT and the second of 7,000 MT were used for the same purpose.  She is confident that she will repay the loan before it comes due and will ask for new loans to build her own chicken coop.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Heidi Petersen, Kiva
