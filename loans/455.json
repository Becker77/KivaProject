Lynneth is single. To make a living, Lynneth owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for this business comes  from selling specialty food products in the local community. Lynneth has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lynneth joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lynneth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Lynneth is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Lynneth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Each member of the group,  Las hijas del Rey, works independently to gain greater revenue, but they also have a common capital fund.   \r\nTo elaborate a little on this group, we would like to mention Mrs. Elsa F., who has two children, a door to door saleswoman (food products, fruit, soda, candy, etc.).  She leaves her home every morning to make her sales in the neighborhood of the Luisito Felix Bogado Market  and she returns home in the afternoon.  She is a woman who has suffered a lot, whose days are all very dificult because, upon arriving at home, she then needs to take care of the household chores.  She does it all because she is a single mother who wants to allow her children a better future.  \r\nShe has a little home made out of meager materials.  Thus, she takes care of the household expenses and those of her children who go to school.  \r\nThe businesses of the other members of the group are:\r\n\r\n1  Aida M. A.

Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 was used to fund the operations of her general store, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing PHP 15,000 for her fourteenth cycle loan which she intends to use to invest in her general store business.

They live together in their own home in the town of Quimbiri, which is located in the beautiful jungle of Cusco.  Victoria is known for being an enterprising and hardworking woman who sells clothing at the moment.  Her business did very well at first since she was the only merchant of her kind, but eventually competition arrived and her sales fell.  Nonetheless, she is able to maintain a steady level of business and now has more customers and her sales have been gradually increasing.  Victoria has learned many lessons from her competition and has already improved several aspects of her business.   She now stocks clothes for all tastes and preferences and sells them to her customers at a reasonable price.  Her vending post is situated in the local market, where she works from 7am until 8pm.  Victoria is determined to succeed and later plans to expand her business to other areas in order to position herself in the marketplace.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.

She is married to Ibrahim who runs a bakery in the city. The family lives in Gaza City in Gaza Strip. The bakery, which is their only source of income, produces different kinds of bread, including locA. breads such as Lebanese, Iraqi, etc. Buthayna and her husband started the bakery four years ago. The bakery supplies a large area around the center of the city as it's the only one producing a large variety of bread. Buthayna came to Kiva's partner, FATEN, for a loan to purchase larger amounts of wheat flour and baking materials as they are planning to double their production and increase their returns.\n\nButhayna's husband appears in the the bakery photo as Buthayna is very religious - as are most Gaza Strip citizens - and doesn't want her picture posted online.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\n \nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the culturA. context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principA. loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She lives in Brgy. Baod, Bantayan, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP 8000. \r\n\r\nJulieta is now borrowing PHP 23,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Julieta aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

","en":"Natalya is 36 years old, divorced, and bringing up a 10 year-old daughter. In 2002, after a difficult divorce from her spouse, Natalya realized that she needed an additional source of income for her family, aside from work as a seller at a local grocery store.

With a lot of effort, she has been able to open her own shop in her home. Her shop has been successful because her customers recognize the high quality of her products. She constantly adds new clients and has seen her business grow. Today Masuda is applying for a loan through IMON International for the first time.

You can help improve the quality of life for Masuda\u2019s family.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, its culture is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and its manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For eight years her work begins very early, since she plants Peruvian potatoes, corn, and gladiolus flowers with her husband. Similarly she makes breads that she sells from 6 in the morning in her town. She prefers to make breads because she enjoys tasting her pastries. For this couple both activities bring in much profit. They explain that the bakery gives them a daily income while agriculture being seasonal permits them to purchase basic necessities. For the future she plans to open a bakery in the city as well as extend her small food store in her home. She also plans on buying more land and plant greater quantities. This is the ninth loan that she has with MFP. Furthermore, she is very happy with the work being done in her communal bank because she learns quite a lot and shares her experiences about savings and investment issues with the rest of the members. With the loan  she will buy many bags of pea seeds, sacs of fertilizer, and bottles of insecticide so she can properly tend her land. Furthermore, she will invest in materials to make pastries and in the purchase of merchandise for her food store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Garza, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":465545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase seeds, fertilizer, merchandise, and ingredients for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-11T18:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daysi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3010.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886641}],"funded_date":"2010-01-11T21:52:21Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Garza","image":688224}},{"id":171207,"name":"Letecia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Letecia C., 44 years old, is a fish vendor.

She is 55 years old. Virginia is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. \r\n\r\nVirginia is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Virginia owns and operates a business making and selling food, primarily selling snacks and other delicacies, in the local community. Virginia has been engaged in her business for 7 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Virginia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virginia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. Virginia is requesting a new loan of 7,500 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Virginia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her husband is an electrician. <P>\r\n\r\nMahbuba started her own business because her husband\u2019s salary was not enough for their family expenses. For more than eleven years, she has operated a store where she sells girl\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing. As a rule she travels to the neighboring town, Istaravshan, to get new garments at very cheap prices. Her store is well known, and people love to visit because it's clean, tidy, and run by someone who is very kind and thoughtful. <P>\r\n\r\nMahbuba hopes that her store will keep growing so that she can maintain a comfortable life for her family, especially for her four children.

Being a young student, she benefits from her friendships that allow her to sell more clothing.  More than 6 months ago she began to sell these products, and in this way she has control over the products that she sells and requests loans for.  She is always on top of new fashion trends so that she can offer her customers good options for purchase.  For this reason she travels to Lima every other week to restock her merchandise.  She desires to increase her wares to earn a greater profit and be able to pay her own bills.  This is her second loan with MFP and she is very happy to be part of the community bank because they are all very punctual with their loans.  She is very responsible with her payments and thanks the people who will provide the loan she is requesting--a loan that will be very useful for her business' progress.  She will use the requested loan to invest in purchasing more women's clothing to sell. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":564432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Women's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-08T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephanie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":150.9},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":154.86},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":162.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":168.8},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":178.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":184.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.07},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.3},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.96},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.59,"local_amount":150.9,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:47Z","rounded_local_amount":159.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673543},{"amount":58.07,"local_amount":154.86,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":164.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887362},{"amount":60.78,"local_amount":162.07,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":171.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154373},{"amount":63.3,"local_amount":168.8,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":178.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449669},{"amount":136.26,"local_amount":363.37,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":384.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588377}],"funded_date":"2010-07-08T18:39:15Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":216845,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma is a married woman with four children who all attend school.She has been operating her business of selling Kikoi (traditional clothing) for the last five years door to door to her neighboring community.\r\n\r\nShe rents a house with no electricity and piped water.

She is 42 years old. Helen is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Helen owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, detergents, sugar, snack foods and canned goods in the local community. Helen has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Helen joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Helen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Helen is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP that will be used to purchase additional inventory and increase working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Helen from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Ni\u00f1o, Malabuyoc, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  a peanut products business and a fish vending businesses. She has 5 children who are between 9 to 25 years old, 1 of her children has a family, 2 are working and 2 are currently going to school. Evangeline joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Evangeline has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 19000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 24000, increasing the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29500, which she intends to use to pay for the  purchase of raw materials. Evangeline T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This is 30 year old Zena M. from Mbeya. She is married with three  children, between the ages of 9 and 15. Zena has been running a clothes business since 1997. She purchases and resells clothing.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9 hours per day, 6 days per week. Zena currently earns about 250USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 750USD in order to purchase more clothes in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to start a new business. Zena thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":271499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing clothing in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-16T18:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Zena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":90909.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":92295.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130782},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":92295.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027571},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":92295.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613572},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":92295.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010651},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":92295.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232937},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":92295.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664729},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":92295.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105453},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":92295.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022598},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":92295.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867847},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:08Z","rounded_local_amount":92295.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757048},{"amount":70.5,"local_amount":90909.1,"processed_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:34Z","rounded_local_amount":92295.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146160}],"funded_date":"2009-02-16T19:43:58Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susanna Heinz","image":1284039}},{"id":93101,"name":"Pedrita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. J. is a bonafide resident of Barangay Sinian, Baliangao.

Since his childhood he has worked in agriculture as well as raising and selling animals.  Everyday, along with his wife, he takes care of his land and brings his animals to fields where there are abundant fresh grass to feed from.  His principal crop is potatoes and for the time being, he is planting on land that his parents gave to him.  His experience as a farmer tells him that he can gain more income by selling his product directly in the local markets, as well as selling his animals in the markets every two months.  \r\n\r\nIn the near future, Juan plans on adquiring his own farmland to increase his production.  This is the second time that Juan has had a loan with MFP. He is a relatively new member of his communal bank and has demonstrated responsibility with his payments, which is why he has been considered again for a loan in this loan cycle.

","en":"Ana is 49 years old, and lives with her husband and four children in their own home. For 28 years she's been selling timber wholesale, supplying a good part of her neighboring communities in the area where she lives. To do this work she uses 2 basic pieces of equipment: a power saw and a truck, which she recently bought to transport her merchandise. Her husband is the co-pilot in transporting the wood, and he is always keeping an eye on removing the wood as well as selling it. In this way the entire family participates in the business and maintaining their economic stability. Ana wants more working capital to stock up on merchandise and thereby maintain a reserve quantity of wood in storage during periods of scarcity. This is the tenth time she has received a loan from MFP and she is one of the most collaborative members of her community bank. The money from the loan will be used to purchase the majority of wood to begin to expand the business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jo Longnecker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":450686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Stock up on timber wood for her business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-17T21:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3038.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886610}],"funded_date":"2009-12-18T16:21:01Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jo Longnecker","image":606476}},{"id":167115,"name":"Rodolfo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rodolfo C.

The group is located in the town of Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca, in the Cuauht\u00e9moc neighborhood.  All the members of the group are hard working and capable of doing whatever is necessary to earn income and have a good quality of life.  The members are from the same neighborhood so know each other well.  It has 12 members: 10 women and 2 men.\r\n\r\nThe group representative is Mrs. In\u00e9s L. Hern\u00e1ndez, 36.  She\u2019s a hard working single mother who has raised her children who are 10 and 7 years of age and in school.  She sells comforters via catalogue and also sells fast food.  In\u00e9s does these things because of the need she has to support her children and provide them with a good education.  In\u00e9s asked for the loan to buy more comforters to sell in order to have profits and be able to survive economically.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carmen X. C., 48, is also a group member.  She\u2019s been a widow for 12 years and only finished elementary school because her parents were very humble and were only able to afford that level of schooling for her.  Since then she has been in a variety of activities to be able to support her children; she has four: Alfonso, 26, who is married, Pablo, 22, who is single and employed, Perla, 20, who is married and Alma,18, who is married.\r\n\r\nCarmen has a locale where she sells soft drinks, Sabritas brand snacks, and juices, among others.  Her locale is located 15 minutes from her house.  Carmen\u2019s customers for the most part are truck drivers that pass by her locale since it\u2019s located at one of the town\u2019s exits.  In addition to the refreshment sales, on weekends she sells tamales to her neighbors.\r\n\r\nCarmen\u2019s dream is to open a locale in her very house and sell more products in order to have more profits.  Carmen comments that she got a loan from another bank to buy ingredients to make the fast food.\r\n\r\nCarmen thanks all those who will fund the loan and who support people of limited resources.\r\n\r\nThe group members are:\r\n\r\nAurelia A.

Thirteen years later, she began to work in a clothing manufacturing enterprise, to which she owes her enterprising experience, which began 11 years later and which has not ended. Irene began a dressmaking business in her own home. Her husband continues to make wooden furniture, and does so independently.  \r\n\r\nIrene has received 17 loans through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo during her 16 years of  association with this organization. Through those years, she has formalized her activity, and increased household income, and she has added sales of cosmetics by means of specialized guides. With this \u201ccredikiva\u201d loan #18, she will buy cloth and sewing supplies, plus cologne and underwear, currently at a discount during a merchandise promotion.\r\n\r\nIrene's long-range dream is to visit Germany, the country of her husband's family. At medium-range, she plans to continue working, in order to have a store well stocked with the merchandise that sells best in her neighborhood. Her great challenge is competition that responds rapidly to customer orders. But she emphasized that her products are of better quality than her competitors offer. For that reason, she holds onto her market. Now, her accounts must be paid every 5 days, her inventories sell each 9 days, and her profitability on sales is no less than 30%.

","en":"Marcelina is a member of the communal bank Alondras. She is 48 years old and the mother of 5 children. She sells chicken sausages and is a grain merchant. She has been working with Finca Peru for three years. During that time she\u2019s been able to increase her working capital. With her first loans she bought a cart to sell chicken sausages.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Her husband works as a mechanic in the kolhoz (farming co-op) and earns a minuscule salary of 10 dollars a month. The family owns a small plot of land where they grow wheat and potatoes, while Malika also owns 30 rams and several heads of cattle. The animals are taken out to pasture by her oldest son and to make the trip easier Malkia used her first loan from Microinvest to buy a horse. She is now planning to use her loan money to increase the number of animals in her herd and so increase the income the family earns from fattening and selling the animals. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated

Her goal is to increase his business, which is located in his house, so that she can expand it and thus earn more money for the family.  Her desire is to obtain more clients for her business so that it grows due to demand for her products that are staple items.  Her dream is that her children are able to study to become professionals, since they have had to work from since they were very little to get ahead and contribute money for the household expenses and thus haven't been able to study.  \r\n\r\nShe works in sales generally, offering clothing, shoes, perfumes.  In addition to this business, she has a small grocery store in which she sells sweets, soup, and basic grains.  The location of the business is her house and has had it for 12 years.  Sandra started this modest business, with the support of her children and husband, in her house with few products.  She later started the other business with more merchandise, through which obtained more clients, and thus came to have the two businesses.  They have cost her a lot of money which is why she needs the loan, to be used as work capital to purchase cosmetics, clothing and school products since the beginning of school year is approaching.  She will thus be able to offer her clients a variety of school products, for which is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and the organizations that concern themselves with the necessities of

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":271551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To

He has been a farmer his entire life, having started working in agriculture as a child. While he waits for the harvest, he gets up every morning to put his cows to pasture. His wife accompanies him on the long walks to the pasture, which is 3 hours away on foot. Casimiro grows crops traditional to the region, like potatoes, corn etc. The majority of his crops are sold directly to specific vendors but he also sells a small part of his harvest himself. Casimiro and his wife would like to continue with this work until their strength fails them.

 Since 1992 Asylbek's family has been successfully growing livestock and reselling agricultural produce.

Stubborn and hard work on his business allows Asylbek to pay for his family's expenses and to support his elderly parents and their household.  \r\n\r\nIn order to continue to increase his livestock headcount Asylbek turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) in order to purchase additional livestock for fattening.
