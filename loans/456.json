Silvina, 51, is a single mother with 1 son.  She owns a home-based business making headwear; she also displays and sells the products that she makes in her house.  Her main customers are tourists, the faithful who flock to the Virgen de Caacupe--the image of the Virgin at the Basilica de Caacupe that is one of the main attractions of that city--every year, along with passing motorists.  Silvina works with her mother and son and the three of them pull together to meet their monthly sales goals.  Silvina's mother is in charge of making the headwear; her son sells their products at local festivals in Cordillera--the department in south-central Paraguay where Caacupe is located; and Silvina sells from the shop in her house.\r\n<p>\r\nHer main achievement--that is, to say, what has allowed her to buy her own home--has been to broaden the range of merchandise she sells which, in turn, has allowed her to increase sales.  She said that starting the business was very difficult because she had to meet government regulations for starting a business at the same time that she was being mother and father to her son.  Nevertheless, she has managed through perseverance to get ahead and now she's even planning to expand her business, renovating a small shop near the Basilica de Caacupe, for which she's looking to the Fundacion Paraguay to help her raise enough money to finish.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Silvina 51 a\u00f1os, es madre soltera y tiene 1 hijo, su taller de confecci\u00f3n est\u00e1 ubicado en su mismo domicilio d\u00f3nde tambi\u00e9n tiene su sal\u00f3n de exposici\u00f3n y venta de sus art\u00edculos, sus principales clientes son los turistas, los fieles que visitan a la Virgen de Caacup\u00e9 cada a\u00f1o (la imagen de la virgen se encuentra en la Bas\u00edlica de Caacup\u00e9 y es una de las principales atracciones de la ciudad)  y los automovilistas que pasan frente a su negocio.\r\nActualmente Silvina, trabaja con su mam\u00e1 y su hijo, los tres se ayudan mutuamente para lograr sus objetivos de ventas mensuales, la encargada de confeccionar los kepis y sombreros es la madre de Silvina, su hijo sale a vender sus productos en las fiestas patronales de las principales ciudades del departamento de la Cordillera, mientras que Silvina los vende en su local.\r\n<p>\r\nSu principal logro dice ser el hecho de haberse comprado una casa propia, y  aumentado el volumen de sus mercader\u00edas en el negocio, lo cual le permiti\u00f3 aumentar sus ventas.

Therefore, my husband sells milk to increase his income. I am a mother of eight: four girls and four boys.  All of my children attend school except the youngest three who are not school age yet. My husband feels that we should raise our living standard, and hence expand our milk business. Please lend us $175 to buy an additional cow for the business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":96488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Raiwind","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.254444 74.217778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2007-12-13T08:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shahnaz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-27T10:22:35Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":14.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2008-01-27T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":917.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":122874},{"amount":15,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2008-02-27T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:41:09Z","rounded_local_amount":917.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":143328},{"amount":15,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2008-03-27T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":917.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167356},{"amount":15,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2008-04-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":917.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":193185},{"amount":15,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2008-05-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":917.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221005},{"amount":15,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2008-06-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:59:39Z","rounded_local_amount":917.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250185},{"amount":15,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2008-07-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T22:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":917.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":278756},{"amount":15,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2008-08-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T22:17:30Z","rounded_local_amount":917.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308276},{"amount":15,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2008-09-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-28T07:07:50Z","rounded_local_amount":917.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339399},{"amount":25.42,"local_amount":1452.37,"processed_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T20:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1554.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5289889},{"amount":14.58,"local_amount":833.37,"processed_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T12:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":891.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9904790}],"funded_date":"2007-12-13T10:22:35Z","paid_date":"2009-01-15T12:50:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":31282,"name":"Sitsofe","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Ms. Sitsofe D. is single and has two children, one in high school and one in middle school.

years. Multan city is famous for its handmade items and for its shrines. Kosar baji is an uneducated lady who couldn\u2019t get an education because her parents couldn\u2019t afford the education expenses due to little financial resource. She married a man whose name is Z. I. and he works in a factory for a monthly wage. Kosar baji is a very hardworking lady. She helps her husband by selling thread. She buys old warm clothes and pulls the thread out from them. Then she washes them and makes a roll. This process takes her a whole day. She sells the thread rolls to the thread sellers and earns an income. Her husband feels proud of her. She is applying for a loan to buy more old warm clothes to increase the profit of her business. \r\n\r\nShe is the group leader of four other women from her locality. Nazir begum baji and Samina begum baji each want a loan to buy material (cloth, colored thread and sketches) for their decorative embroidery business. Haseena baji wants a loan to buy cigarettes to sell. Sardaran mai baji wants a loan to buy a buffalo for her milk selling business. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":321329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

M. es un se\u00f1or de 64 a\u00f1os de edad que vive con su madre su esposa y su hijo.\nLa comunidad en la cual vive don Elvin se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nDon Elvin  se dedica desde hace 3 a\u00f1os a la producci\u00f3n de leche y queso como una forma de generar ingresos para su familia. Dice estar muy contento porque gracias a este proyecto ha podido salir adelante. Comenta que la producci\u00f3n de leche la vende a la planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos, propiedad de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce.\n\nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive don Elvin es famoso en todo Costa Rica. Es un queso fresco que se le conoce tradicionalmente como \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d. A los \u201cticos\u201d (como se les conoce a los habitantes de Costa Rica) les gusta mucho consumir este producto; se le encontrar\u00e1 en las mesas acompa\u00f1ando cualquier tipo de comida.  Por esta raz\u00f3n, el mercado para dicho producto es realmente bueno.\n\nDon Elvin desea obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito por un monto de \u00a2500.000 (quinientos mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera m\u00e1s y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche. El sabe que contar con una vaca m\u00e1s es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo. Sin embargo, el deseo de ser un microempresario exitoso y  sacar adelante a su familia mejorando las condiciones de vida, lo motiva a esforzarse con gran esmero y dedicaci\u00f3n.\n\nDon Elvin es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la micro financiera EDESA. Este ser\u00e1 su d\u00e9cimo segundo pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico\n\n\n","en":"Elvin M. M., 64, lives with his mother, wife, and son.  Elvin lives in the El Sauce de Santa Teresita Turrialba community in the Cargao province.  It is a small rural community with approximately two thousand inhabitants.  The community members work at milk production and planting coffee.  The landscape is irregular, and much of the land is humid tropical rain forest.  The community has very colorful scenery that combines the tropical rainforest with two pretty lakes, coffee plantations, and dairies.  \r\n\r\nEl Sauce is located approximately an hour and a half by bus from Turrialba, which is the closest commercial center.  Nevertheless, several times a year the road becomes impossible to use because of the rains that batter the area.  This is, without doubt, one of the biggest challenges for the area.\r\n\r\nWhen there was no work, many people chose to leave to look for work in Turrialba or in banana farms located in the Atlantic zone of Costa Rica.  Currently, coffee and milk prices have improved.  Therefore, the members of the neighborhood are looking for ways to invest in projects in their own zone in order to avoid emigrating.\r\n\r\nFor three years Elvin has worked at milk and cheese production as a way to generate income for his family.  He is very happy; thanks to this work, he has been able to get ahead.  He sells his milk to the plant that makes cheese, which is the property of the Association of Milk Producers of El Sauce.\r\n\r\nThe cheese from the region where Elvin lives is famous throughout Costa Rica.  It is a fresh cheese that is traditionally known as \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d (Turrialba type of cheese).  The \u201cticos\u201d (inhabitants of Costa Rica) really like to eat this product, which can be found on their tables as an accompaniment to all types of food.  For that reason, the market for the product is really good.\r\n\r\nElvin wants a loan for $500 to buy another milking cow in order to increase his milk production.  He knows that having another cow is a big sacrifice, and that it will demand more work.  Nevertheless, the desire to be a successful entrepreneur, to help his family\u2019s future, and to improve their living conditions, motivates him to work with great dedication.\r\n\r\nElvin is a member of the Association of Producers of El Sauce, a local organization belonging to the micro finance association Edesa.  This will be his 12th loan, and he hopes to continue growing personally and economically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Now, she earns an average monthly income of  Php 10,000 from her business activities.\n\nNelia is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 25,000 was used to fund operations of her general store and direct-selling of Avon beauty products, which had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is requesting her 16th loan, in the amount of Php 29,500, which she intends to invest in her general store, clothes-selling, and networking businesses. Nelia is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\n\nAbout NWTF:\n\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She is 52 years old. Erlinda is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Erlinda's Group.\r\n\r\nErlinda is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Erlinda owns & operates a general store where she sells a variety of different products in the local community. Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over 16 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Erlinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 28,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Erlinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":463210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He then became interested in joining the individual lending program. Yakobus is requesting a loan of IDR 5,000,000.

of the North West Region of Cameroon. The deaths of his son, sister and father-in-law are the main challenges that he has faced in his life and hates thinking about.\n\nThis hard working man has taken and repaid loans ten times, and is involved in poultry farming and the cultivation of some basic food crops like maize, beans, groundnuts, yams, and coco yams. His business is located in the Ntangang quarter. He believes his business will succeed, because the animal excrement will be used as manure for the crops and, in turn, some of the harvest from the farm will be used to feed the animals. Demand of food crops is high in his locality, and his neighbors also buy some of his animals for consumption on occasion and for ceremonies such as weddings, funeral celebrations, and cultural rites.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They and two brothers live in the same Santa M\u00f3nica neighborhood where they grew up.\r\n\r\nCarmen is 52 years old, married, and has 2 children; she had 3 but one died. Her two children are grown, married, and have their own families. Four of her grandchildren live with her. She is a very happy, friendly, and good-humored woman. She works with her sister, Mar\u00eda Norma, selling clothing, and she also has a small business on El Murci\u00e9lago beach where she sells soda pop and beer to the tourists.\r\n\r\nCarmen always works on the weekends at the beach, and depending on the quantity of people present sometimes she works during the week. She has been selling at the beach for 3 years, and even longer selling clothing with her sister. They sell primarily underwear and regularly work in a location called Picoaz\u00e1 in Portoviejo, a city located 40 minutes from Manta city.\r\n\r\nThe clothing sales rise and fall according to the season, she says, but in general sales go well. She generally doesn\u2019t sell in unknown places, because the people can more easily disappear without paying, so she doesn\u2019t like to sell to people she doesn\u2019t know or hardly knows.\r\n\r\nCarmen Narciza is seeking a loan to invest little by little in her businesses, buying beer, soda pop and clothing. She also is planning to finish the installation of a shower in her home.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":376452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy clothing, beer, and soda pop for her busineses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-09-14T18:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Narcisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035183},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035184},{"amount":275.11,"local_amount":275.11,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":275.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947438},{"amount":137.39,"local_amount":137.39,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":137.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789290},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:10Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789291},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679705}],"funded_date":"2009-09-16T00:43:53Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":137868,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Vilma V.

A. is 60 years old, and lives with her mother in a small rural community in Costa Rica called Cuatro Bocas de Upala, in the province of Alajuela.  There they are developing many activities such as trade, stockbreeding for two purposes (meat and milk), and agriculture.\r\n<p>\r\nFor quite some time, Vilma has been taking care of her mother.  She says that when she was younger, she could go to work outside of the house, but with the passing of the years, her mother\u00b4s health has been deteriorating, which made Vilma leave her job.  But she has always worked very hard, and she has taken back up a project that she had years before.  Now Vilma works in the Teca plantation.  Teca is a lush tree that has the capacity to not be damaged when it comes into contact with metals.  Its wood is very resistant to water, which makes it very valuable for making furniture and boats.  \r\n<p>\r\nNow Vilma wants to obtain a loan for 650 colons, in order to do maintenance in her plantation, and also to buy fertilizers, and to pay for other necessary inputs to keep it in a good state.  \r\n<p>\r\nVilma is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Bansuperafe; which is only made up of women, and specializes in supporting non-professional women and female heads of households.

With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries.

He also likes the smell that the fruit omits. Although normally he sows by himself, when the production increases Fidel contracts several workers who help him clean and prepare the soil. He has planned to increase his production to sell a greater quantity of fruit and begin sowing plantains. This is his sixth loan with MFP, and he is very thankful to all the people that made possible the support for him to continue working. He is thinking of investing this loan in purchasing fertilisers to improve the production of his future star fruit crops. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory,

With this loan, she hopes to earn income of 135,000 francs per month which she will use to increase her working capital, contribute to the family's expenses, and pay interest on the loan.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Eileen Jessop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":579834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy bales of used clothing..","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":145,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":72304.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180831},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":36152.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476802},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":36152.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613511},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":36152.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751943},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:21Z","rounded_local_amount":36152.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606195},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":36152.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917868},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":36152.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360797},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":36152.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226142},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":36152.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301068}],"funded_date":"2010-09-04T07:42:00Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Jessop","image":249690}},{"id":224713,"name":"Mbogo Bakyara Twimukye, Ibanda Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jonabu N. is the member of Mbogo Bakyara Twimukye group in Ibanda.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Chinakul started her business, breeding and raising livestock, with an initial investment of 5,000 KGS, and has expanded her farm to 5 cows and 60 rams, currently bringing in about 15,000 KGS per month. The farm, which has become a family business, has a promising future. The small town of Asylbash, where Chinarkul lives with her family, is an ideal place to raise animals, as there are many pastures for grazing livestock. With the goal of increasing the amount of livestock further, Chinarkul has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 KGS, to purchase cows. She plans to use the income obtained from investing the loan to further develop her business.

She lives in her own home with her husband and two children, in a district of the central forest.  \r\n\r\nFelicita is a tireless woman.  In the warmth of her home, she does what she enjoys:  preparing various food dishes.  She always sees opportunities to start a business.  When her children had greater needs for their education, she had to come up with ways to generate more income and not depend only on her husband's salary.  In this way, she began preparing traditional sweets such as \"chapanas,\" that are made with a yucca flour and sugar base.  However, what she sells the most are tamales, made with ground corn and a meat filling, as well as \"patasca\" (a traditional soup consisting of beef or sheep giblets). \r\n\r\n\"The air base places orders with me for typical dishes every Sunday.  I can't complain, it's going well for me,\" she says proudly.  But for this, she has to wake up early to prepare the dishes.  She is now used to the routine and has regular customers to whom she distributes food.  \r\n\r\nThis month she got a corn mill on credit, which makes her food preparation easier.

Meri is 20 years old and she is currently attending school. Like a strong woman would, she has been able to pull through the impact of her husband's passing, thanks to her work that takes up her attenion and many hours of her day. For the past 20 years, Carlota's days begin at 8a.m. when she travels to the market to open up her stand to sell children's clothing.  According to Carlota, her work is wonderful, especially because she's always around children and their Mom trying on clothes. Her heart is filled with happiness with so many children, but on the other hand to work all day the way she does is very exhausting.

M. is a woman who hails from the town of Pililia, Rizal province in the Philippines. She is 36-year-old wife to Jose, who is 36 years old and a farmer. They were blessed with five children; three males and two females. All her children are all studying.\nIn 2004, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines with an aspiration to have access to capital for her business. For more than three years already, she is engaged with farming business and she is partnered by her husband. Farming of rice is a common source of livelihood in the upland and lowland villages in the country. Since rice is the staple food  for Filipinos, the demand for its grains is high.\nShe noticed that farming as a business brings bigger income and it gives her the chance to save and to sustain the needs of her children to school. Farming needs capital especially during cultivation until it grows and bear grains. She wanted to invest more on it.\nNow on her 7th loan, she proposes a loan of 25,000 pesos as additional capital for her farming business. Specifically, the amount will be used to pay for the metal cover of a handtractor and a motor engine to make it run. She is looking forward to send her children to school until they finish college and find jobs. She also aspires of purchasing farm lands in the future to expand her farming business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":381015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She lives with her children in the H\u00e9r\u00e9makono Nord district of the town of Bougouni (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). \r\n\r\nFor social reasons, Djeneba never went to a modern school, but to a \"m\u00e9dersa\" (private islamic school which offers a religious education). As a housewife, she became interested in income-generating activities only after her husband died, and then in order to provide for her own needs as well as those of her children. For this reason she decided to run a business selling shop items. She learned this trade with one of her dead husband's friends. \r\n\r\nHaving had five years experience, she now masters the business well. In order to satisfy her sharply increasing customer base better, she has joined the loan programme at Soro Yiriwaso and is on her first individual loan with this company. With the loan she is planning to buy various items for her shop. She stocks up at Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali) and sells to a customer base of local people, on a retail basis, for cash and on credit. She hopes to make a monthly profit of 60,000 FCFA. With this profit she plans to expand her shop.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

The Yiriwa group deals in various products: incense, soap, stainless steel cups, peanut butter, cookies made from millet, tea, and telephone cards.\r\nThey decided to get involved with Soro Yiriwaso with the goal of increasing their working capital, and they are on their third joint loan. \r\nMrs. Fatoumata S., who is quite successful at selling peanut butter, plans to use her loan to buy five sacks of peanuts.  She gets her peanuts wholesale at the market in Konodimini.\r\nTo make peanut butter, the peanuts are shelled (by hand), she selects the best peanuts for grilling and then takes them to the mill for grinding.  The resulting peanut butter is ready to be sold in small pots or at retail in small plastic bags. Her clientele consists mainly of women who buy from her home and in the town of S\u00e9gou, who pay in cash and sometimes on credit. \r\nLike the other members of the group, Fatoumata S. hopes to make an average monthly profit of 35, 000 FCFA which will used to pay for their children\u2019s schooling and to reinvest in their business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Shannon Arnold, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":530091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy peanuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Dougounikoro ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T17:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saran                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kala              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":270.83,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":134351.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779241},{"amount":270.84,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":134351.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961452},{"amount":270.83,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":134351.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699568},{"amount":270.83,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":134351.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913461},{"amount":270.84,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":134351.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180635},{"amount":270.83,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":134351.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476602}],"funded_date":"2010-05-02T21:50:35Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Arnold","image":null}},{"id":200150,"name":"Phanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Phanna D., 25, and her husband, Mr. Mun Khoem, 30, live on an island in the Mekong River about 15 kilometers from Phnom Penh City.

Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Teresita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase house materials. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Teresita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married to Romeo, a mechanic, and she is a mother to four children, two of whom are already studying in college and the other two are in high school. She, together with her husband and children, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nHelen operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Helen earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 22,000 loan. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nHelen hopes to be able to expand her business soon and be able to send all of her children all the way through college.

After several years of training alongside them, she finished by starting her own business, choosing to sell clothes and shoes. She has run this business for 15 years now and has extensive experience and a large clientele. Her strength in sales is due to the quality of her items, which are imported.\r\nWith the hope of meeting her customers' demands, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso and has been working with this institution for 60 months.

She will then sell retail at the great market to a clientele of women and men, for cash or credit.\r\n\r\nShe expects this funding will generate monthly profits of 110.000 FCFA she intends to use to reimburse Soro loan interests and contribute to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nLooking to the future, Mariam plans to diversify her business activity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":939753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy bags of groundnuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-12-07T20:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:50Z","rounded_local_amount":83515.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283251},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83515.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424761},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":83515.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140026},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":83515.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757000},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":83515.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251765},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":83515.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410771}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T18:43:20Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":372288,"name":"Donna Kerr","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Donna Kerr is a 31-year-old, married woman.

Lleva 20 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus cultivos hasta la ciudad de San Francisco, pues es ah\u00ed donde vende sus productos.

She is a hardworking woman, who lives at home with her husband, Eliseo, aged 56, and her seven dear children, for whom she wants to provide a better quality of life. \n\nTogether with her husband Eliseo, Dina works every day on their land.  With much effort she has been able to make their land be very productive and she plants a little of everything, as she knows that any product she gets will be good.  She mainly plants cocoa and coffee plants, as these are the best selling products in the market. \n\nWhat she likes most about her job is protecting her crops from the insect infestations that can affect them and which would greatly reduce her profits.\n\nShe has spent 20 years doing this, and believes that the most difficult part is transporting their crops to the city of San Francisco, for that is where she sells her products.  On the other hand, the insect infestations affect the plants and therefore Dina will use the requested loan to buy mesh to make screens to protect the plants from the insects who take over the fruit. \n\nThis will be her tenth loan through MFP, so she hopes for a little support from lenders to carry out her plan, and she is capable of repaying all their contributions promptly, as with her previous loans.  In her community bank, she is a very supportive partner for the rest of her colleagues. \n\nWith the 3,000 New Soles, she will buy meshes by the meter to make screens and combat the insects that lurk in her crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":818104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy several meters of mesh.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-22T22:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":326.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":341.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":357},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":367.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":382.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":394.61},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":408.01},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":422.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.3},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.9},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.27},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.69},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":119.63,"local_amount":326.25,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":327.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350755},{"amount":125.3,"local_amount":341.75,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:34Z","rounded_local_amount":342.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851119},{"amount":130.9,"local_amount":357,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:40Z","rounded_local_amount":358.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666296},{"amount":134.66,"local_amount":367.25,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":368.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621453},{"amount":140.27,"local_amount":382.56,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":383.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835527},{"amount":144.69,"local_amount":394.61,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":396.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245289},{"amount":149.61,"local_amount":408.01,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":409.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385412},{"amount":154.94,"local_amount":422.57,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":424.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098535}],"funded_date":"2011-07-23T14:25:58Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":323099,"name":"Celsa Dolores","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Esta se\u00f1ora es originaria de telica es maestra del colegio sagrado coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas, con 25 a\u00f1os de impartir clases, su n\u00facleo familiar consta de 3 personas su esposo y 2 hijos los que estudian  en los colegios de la localidad, est\u00e1 solicitando financiamiento para la compra de zinc y clavos, para la construcci\u00f3n de mejora de vivienda, el d\u00eda laborar de esta se\u00f1ora es salir a las 6 de la  ma\u00f1ana teniendo que transportar autob\u00fas y recorrer 12 km, dicho cr\u00e9dito le ayudara a mejorar sus condiciones y nivel de vida.","en":"\r\nThis lady is from Telica.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMylene dreams to be able to give all her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":922519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-11-22T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mylene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3615.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529539},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3616.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738768},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2891.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146000},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":723.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275065}],"funded_date":"2011-11-23T07:43:12Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dara Olmsted Silverstein","image":973449}},{"id":364110,"name":"Mira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mira is 35 years old and lives in the Philippines.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":351089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-07-11T14:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665075},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105787},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:22Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022897},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868138},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757334},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146428}],"funded_date":"2009-07-12T08:21:03Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":125577,"name":"Maria Concepcion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

The results were positive and he was able to repay ahead of schedule.

She has been producing milk, maize, beans and pineapples, all of which she sells to the local market. Her primary challenge in farming has been lack of enough animal feed that affects her milk production, and lack of reliable casual labourers. She is also employed and earns extra income from her retail shop and rental houses in the same area.\n\nEsther is 50 years old. She is married and has three children between the ages of 11 and 19. All her children are attending school.\n\nShe has requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo for 45,000 Kenyan shillings to purchase and insure a dairy cow. The extra income from this loan will improve the standard of living of the family since there will be more disposable income from the sale of milk. In future, she would like to increase the size of her land and plant more dairy feed. She also plans to increase her rental houses and the number of her dairy cows. \n\nEsther is part of a 5 person solidarity group -- when one receives a loan, the others guarantee it.  As it is her rotation, this loan is for Esther's business alone.  She says, however, that group lending is sometimes discouraging because not all members are reliable. She hopes Juhudi will consider giving loans without requiring solidarity groups in future.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":563784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
