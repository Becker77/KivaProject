It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Married to Erwin C., a jeepney barker, they are blessed with five children. She helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life. She has been managing her own buy and sell business for two years now.\r\n\r\nMarina has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow four times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She has been consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her buy and sell business.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a loan of PHP 9,000.

is easy to start up the business. It usually begins with table-top selling and then grows to become a kiosk and eventually becomes a supermarket. Isheitu is one of such entrepreneurs; she has been trading in groceries like biscuits, bottled water, candies, canned foods, rice, cooking oil, toiletries, etc. for the past 6 years. She is hoping that, one day, she will be able to rent a bigger shop to expand her business. \r\n\r\nIsheitu is excited to be taking the loan which she plans to invest in purchasing groceries in bulk to serve her customers. She anticipates increasing her profit level and also expanding her market. \r\n\r\nIsheitu is married to a farmer and they have two children, ages 7 and 13. She describes herself as an excellent group leader of 'Adiyisem' Borrower Group, made up of 6 members. As the leader of the group, she ensures regular meeting attendance and repayment of loan installments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":556655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase groceries in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Sunyani","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"7.333333 -2.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2010-06-18T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Akosua","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anastasia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isheitu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":2700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":225,"processed_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-02T09:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":227.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151958739},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-02T09:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":454.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159697416},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-05T08:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":454.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166911570},{"amount":316.66,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-12T11:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":454.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172179094},{"amount":475,"local_amount":675,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-18T11:05:21Z","rounded_local_amount":681.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177475264},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":225,"processed_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-08T11:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":227.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182612165},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":225,"processed_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-08T11:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":227.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182612166}],"funded_date":"2010-06-22T10:21:03Z","paid_date":"2011-01-08T11:39:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":212876,"name":"Sodji","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"E. exerce comme activit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de revenu le commerce de produits d\u2019alimentation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il fait  ce commerce depuis 5 ans  d\u00e9j\u00e0 et s\u2019approvisionne au grand march\u00e9 de Lom\u00e9, il souhaite gonfler son stock raison pour laquelle il sollicite de WAGES un cr\u00e9dit  pour s\u2019approvisionner et augmenter son stock.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  a general store, an electronic shop and a mineral water sales business. Her husband Marino, who is 60 years old, works as a technician to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 26 and 32 years old. Ruby joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 28 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ruby has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 29th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to buy items for her store and mineral water so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Ruby is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He works in the city of Ica, which is currently known as one of the main cities in the country in which to invest.  This has been achieved thanks to the opening of new shopping malls with retailers from different parts of the country.  These big companies have given work opportunities to many more people.  This has also benefited those who do not work in these large shopping malls.  One case is that of Dairo who, thanks to the increase in the number of people and the great need that they have to move around, has been able to make more income with a lot of effort and commitment.\r\n\r\nDairo is a young man who very much likes playing football (soccer) in his free time.  This allows him to spend time with his friends.  Dairo works an average of 8 hours a day which allows him to make 45 soles a day.  One must bear in mind that the cost per trip via this mode of transport costs between 1 and 1.5 soles, depending on distance.  Dairo thinks that his business is successful because he starts work early and puts in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nDairo's mother encouraged him to start out in this business so that he could make his own income.  Thanks to Kiva lenders, Dairo will be able to pay off the remaining installments on the motorcycle taxi that he works with.  This help will mean that in a few months time thanks to his efforts and, of course, the support of Kiva lenders, he will be able to buy another motorcycle taxi with which to work.

Siempre trabaj\u00f3 en diversas actividades por la responsabilidad que ten\u00eda en criar a sus tres hijos, ahora se ocupa a la venta de carne de pollo y a la construcci\u00f3n de cajones, estas dos actividades las realiza en su domicilio, tratando siempre de prestar el tiempo necesario a su familia.Trabajar en su casa le ayuda a no alejarse de sus hijos y dedicarse a la par con sus dos negocios, siendo esto lo que m\u00e1s le agrada, la flexibilidad de tiempo, pero siempre existen los aspectos dif\u00edciles, siendo uno de ellos, el cumplir con los pedidos de cajones, ya que por falta de maquinaria o algunos recursos la limitan a seguir trabajando. Lidia tiene visualizado el ver a sus hijos profesionales, esto es su mejor motor de progreso. Est\u00e1 muy convencida en invertir el dinero que solicita en la compra de mayor cantidad de madera y atender a las demandas de las personas, y con el tiempo ser una gran empresaria en este rubro en su localidad."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":190800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase wood to make crates in order to increase business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-08-14T07:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia Teodosia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-28T13:24:32Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71,"local_amount":200.47,"processed_date":"2008-09-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":207.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340548},{"amount":71,"local_amount":200.47,"processed_date":"2008-10-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-29T07:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":207.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372911},{"amount":70.5,"local_amount":199.06,"processed_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":205.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335716},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":206.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9956894},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":206.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227144},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":206.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422386}],"funded_date":"2008-08-14T13:24:32Z","paid_date":"2009-03-18T08:07:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":64543,"name":"Aydee","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Aydee tiene 26 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo y sus tres hijos.

She lives with her husband and three children.  She is a young mother who strives to obtain daily sustenance for her family, and she does so doing farm work.  It was six years ago that she got married and began to share this work with her husband.  She grows potato, 'olluco' and some vegetables like onion.  She generally does this in the afternoons because in the mornings, she works at a government program called \"Wawawasi\".  There, her work is like that of a nanny- she offers her house and her time to take care of children of other women when they are working and don't have a place to leave their children.  During harvest time, her work load increases, but her efforts pay off because she is then able to take her products to the city to sell directly.  While she waits for this moment, she also devotes her time to other money making activities such as breeding livestock to fatten and then sell.  This is how she passes the time during the 6 month wait until harvest.  Aydee constantly strives for her well being and that of her children.  With this loan, she will be able to purchase a bull, so she can continue succeeding with her crops and livestock.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Natalie Kane, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":201599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a bull to increase the number of her livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-09-18T03:30:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-02T05:06:18Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335958},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957136},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227386},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422621},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27115844},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36010808}],"funded_date":"2008-09-18T05:06:18Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:39:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"thu doan","image":55858}},{"id":68651,"name":"Dilorom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Married to Philippe Kohoun, Bernadette is the mother of four children who are all in school, two of whom she is currently supporting. The couple takes care of the family expenses together. Having dropped out of school at the secondary level, for almost five years Bernadette has been selling fabric and \"bouillie\" (cornstarch or millet based food) accompanied by p\u00e2t\u00e9 (made with a wheat flour base). Bernadette also sells fabric. Bernadette gets her supplies in Dantokpa, the international market of B\u00e9nin and in the Ouando market in Porto-Novo. Bernadette sells her bouillie in the Danto school in Porto-Novo, but she sells her fabric in Ouando. This is Bernadette's first loan with Alid\u00e9. Bernadette is requesting this loan from Alid\u00e9 to increase her working capital and to better satisfy her customer's needs.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her retail business,  she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 55,000. \r\n\r\nGina  is now borrowing PHP 29,500 so that she  can  purchase more stock to sell.   This will be her 21st loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For twenty years she has been running a dairy business, distributing milk and homemade milk products to regular buyers.  It took much effort and trying several different types of businesses before she focused on milk production. \r\n\r\nFor a long period of time, Olmaskhan was a farmer, gathering crops each fall.  She later switched to retail, selling food products in a local market.  After that, she bought cattle and made the first attempts at milk retail. The business was started with the small amount of 5,000 soms.  She now makes twice that amount each month.  Olmaskhan has two young kids and, not long ago, gave birth to a third child. The toddler needs care and good conditions. Olmaskhan hopes to receive her portion of the loan, which she will spend on the purchase of a baby carriage. \r\n\r\n --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (being environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

This group is made up of five business people -- micro-entrepreneurs -- and is located in the rural area of Samana, a lush, rugged peninsula with a nascent tourism industry. \r\n\r\nYdelsa lives with her long-term partner and her two children. She says that her biggest challenge is to build her house as a safe structure made of concrete blocks, and her most favorite things to do are learn and visit her friends and family. She runs a jewelry sales business, selling jewelry door to door and by walking around her community. With this loan, she will purchase silver jewelry, like rings, necklaces, bracelets, and other silver accessories. \r\n\r\nShe is excited to receive her fourth loan with Esperanza. She has been part of this group for almost two years, and with each loan she has been able to improve her sales and has earned more clients. With the profits from her business, she will reinvest in her business and put more income into her house. Ydelsa thanks all of you for your support of her business and her group.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<P>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This will enable her to earn more profit and enable her to cater for the requirements of her four fatherless children as she was widowed at a tender age.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":547144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hotel","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy foodstuffs and a pool table for her hotel","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ntungamo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.916667 30.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-05-30T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jolly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jovia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yosam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arthur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Johnson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Herbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4990000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1247500},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1247500},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1247500},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1247500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1247500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1259332.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662506},{"amount":550,"local_amount":1247500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1259332.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689284},{"amount":550,"local_amount":1247500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1259332.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903440},{"amount":550,"local_amount":1247500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1259332.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296917}],"funded_date":"2010-06-03T17:00:50Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":208811,"name":"Fanni Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fanny Rosa, tiene 41 a\u00f1os, es casada, tiene dos hijos y es natural del Cusco.

He is married and has five children of school age. Ziyodullo is producing the national cradles. The national cradles in Tajikistan are very colorful. They are made of wood. As a rule, the national cradle is presented by the grandparents when the baby is 40 days old and this event is celebrated in the family circle. \r\n\r\nZiyodullo has been in this business for 11 years.

For the entire period of time, he had shown himself as a successful client, managing his loans with accuracy and precision. Today, Ziyodullo requests a loan in the amount of 6900 Somoni in order to purchase planks and paints for producing the cradles. \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She used to be a member of 'Nueva Esperanza' (New Hope), a group of borrowers that have appeared on Kiva.org more than once and have always successfully repaid their loans. Simenis is now asking for a loan as an individual because she requires a larger amount than is usually offered to borrowers that are members of a group. \r\n\r\nSimenis lives in the Hato Mayor region of the Dominican Republic, located in the east of the country. Hato Mayor is a fairly mountainous region where the principal industry is agriculture. Simenis' community, like nearly all impoverished areas in the Dominican Republic, suffers from a constant shortage of running water and electricity. As well as Dominicans, Haitian immigrants make up a large proportion of Simenis' community.\r\n  \r\nSimenis requires her loan to invest in stock for her clothing business. As well as clothes, Simenis sells a variety of footwear - shoes, trainers and slippers. Simenis started this business 12 years ago and actually lists her favourite pastime as trading with customers! Simenis is very excited about taking out another loan so that she can continue to grow her business. She hopes to finish off the construction of her house with the profits that she makes, something which she also says is her biggest current challenge."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":648952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To invest in her clothes business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Hato Mayor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.833333 -69.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2010-11-24T02:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simenis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1189.52},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1034.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1157.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1199.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1283.19},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1289.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1346.59},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1384.97},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1442.19},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1487.22},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1541.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1598.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":45.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.46},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.08},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.57},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.09},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.27},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.95},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.46,"local_amount":1189.52,"processed_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1231.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534135},{"amount":29.08,"local_amount":1034.16,"processed_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1070.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188670891},{"amount":37.88,"local_amount":1347,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1394.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414225},{"amount":35.16,"local_amount":1250.17,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1294.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195991105},{"amount":36.31,"local_amount":1291,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1336.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275177},{"amount":37.17,"local_amount":1321.64,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:54:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1368.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206142442},{"amount":78.97,"local_amount":2807.98,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2906.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211215488},{"amount":83.21,"local_amount":2958.6,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-18T07:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3062.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221657353},{"amount":78.76,"local_amount":2799.93,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2898.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227025267}],"funded_date":"2010-11-24T04:17:57Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:56:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":253889,"name":"Teddy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teddy N. is 20 years old and lives in the town of Njeru in the Jinja region of Uganda.

In 2000, she established her religious statue-making business.  Working 7 days a week and 6 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid 5 loans from Patan BPW.  Tari mai used her most recent loan to buy raw materials such as bronze, wax and silver for her work.  In the future, Tari mai plans to improve the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.   \r\n\r\nNepal has a long and rich history of traditional handicrafts.  Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity.  Terra cotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills.  Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing.  \r\n\r\nIn Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone.  With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume.  This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit margin.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

She is 60 years old, is married, and has 8 adult children. To make a living, Elisa owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC of 3000 PHP, which was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Elisa is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 2nd loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She began making a living in this way when she invested money from a loan over ten years ago to get started and with the dedication that she puts forth, she has seen her little stable grow. The care that she takes to feed the animals and supply them with occasional medical visits from the veterinarian has increased their population and so now she guides them into the field each day for feeding. She makes sure not to neglect her role as a mother, because she\u2019s also very dedicated to lovingly raising her five children, who also help out in caring for the animals during their free time. She wants to improve her stable stalls and produce milk in a quantity sufficient for selling it commercially.

With her request for a loan from Afodenic, she will purchase construction materials like:  cement, iron, brick, and metal for her roof to offer her customers better protection so they will prefer her restaurant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":244542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase construction materials to remodel her location","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:01:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lesbia De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.54,"local_amount":1115.03,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:22:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1162.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816820},{"amount":59.44,"local_amount":1132.21,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1180.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351505},{"amount":59.4,"local_amount":1131.35,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1179.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038844},{"amount":63.15,"local_amount":1203.01,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1254,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929142},{"amount":61.04,"local_amount":1162.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1211.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384053},{"amount":58.91,"local_amount":1122.14,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:32:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1169.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890519},{"amount":164.52,"local_amount":3133.61,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3266.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111818}],"funded_date":"2009-01-05T17:12:16Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T09:41:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":85069,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy O. has a restaurant where she sells cooked foods like rice, beans, plantains, yams, etc. She has been in this business for a long time.

They own their home, and devote themselves to the hard work of selling chicken, chorizo, eggs, etc. Mr. Hugo has his own stand within German Moreno market that he has worked at for many years. Through this experience, a strategic location within the marketplace, and the popularity of the market itself, the stand has managed to continue attracting many customers despite competition. This loan will be used to invest in the maintenance of the vehicle Hugo employs to transport his chickens from his home to the stand. The family has an excellent credit history (this will be their 8th loan!).

Ismoil likes to work for himself. His business has been the main source of income for his whole family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her husband in a large traditional family in the first district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nHaving abandoned school in the 9th primary grade (Malian education system) to get married, she started business beside her mother who sold Moroccan living rooms. After spending several years in apprenticeship at her side, she ran several income-generating businesses such as the sale of fruit juices. She wound up taking up the trade of carpets that she has been engaged in for 3 years and enjoys a large customer base. The strength of her sales is due to the quality of her products that are often imported but also to her affordable prices.\r\nWith the objective of increasing the size of her business to make more profits, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso. This is her first individual loan that she intends to use to purchase 8 carpets. She gets her supplies in Tombouctou. Mrs. Nana M\u2019barka H. sells cash and on credit to a customer base of women and men.\r\nWith this loan, she plans to make a monthly profit of 60,000 CFA francs. This profit will enable her to take part in the funding of social events (christenings, weddings etc.\u2026) and support herself. Her ambition is to promote her business and go forward.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Marie-Elodie Bazy, Kiva

Alternatively, his wife plants local products, native to the area, such as potatoes, peas and olluco (a tuber) on their own land.

As mentions Vaghinak it is very hard but very important for him to provide his student daughter with all she needs and also to help his son to cover his needs until he will find some job. His farm products Vaghinak sells right from his farm to his regular customers. This loan of 700.000 Armenian drams he needs as he decided to enlarge the number of his livestock with two more calves and also he will buy fodder for all his farm cattle.

He came to us originally about a year ago in search of a loan to start a small bike repair shop in the Roma ghetto in Sliven, Bulgaria.  He was one of our first clients and has turned out to be the one in which we have the most pride.  The Roma are viewed by most ethnic Bulgarians as lazy, shifty and entirely untrustworthy; Angel has completely upended that stereotype. <p>\r\n\r\nWhen we met, Angel had worked at a bike repair shop in the commercial center of Sliven for close to 15 years.  Upon the shop\u2019s closing, he aimed to strike out on his own and start a shop within the Roma ghetto.  20,000 Roma live in the neighborhood in conditions that are shockingly below the European average.  Biking isn\u2019t the leisure activity it is for many in the West; rather, for many it is the only affordable way to get around.  For the most part, bikes that the Roma ride have only one gear on a small frame.  <p>\r\n\r\nAfter being denied his loan by six banks, Angel heard about our nascent program.  With a loan of $850, Angel turned a part of his concrete home into his workshop, purchased metalworking tools and bought the supplies he would need.  After a busy summer of work, his business slowed in the late fall with the turn in weather.  However, Angel figured out a way to put his metalworking tools to work and began repairing and making doors and window frames for neighborhood clients.  Six weeks ago, some of his tools broke and he needed to purchase new ones for which we made him a supplemental loan.  In the process, he impressed the metalworking sales agent to the point where he became a leasing agent for the company.  <p>\r\n\r\nAngel now has three lines of business.  His achievements are remarkable and have been featured in national newspapers.  Angel is a great role model for many in his neighborhood.  This loan will be to cover his new equipment and provide a new line of working capital to all three of his lines of business.  \r\n\r\nAngel's original posting is here: <p>\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.kiva.org\/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=274 \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe photo here shows Angel in front of his shop.

This time she will invest in buying merchandise, stocking her store with personal hygiene products, beauty products, and little gifts, among other things.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Megan Tatman Montgomery, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":231683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy merchandise for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-05T03:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1236.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210629}],"funded_date":"2008-12-19T22:50:00Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Megan Montgomery","image":165391}},{"id":80989,"name":"Denis Leonel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Joven empresario Denis Leonel Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez tiene la edad de 21 a\u00f1os, su estado civil es casado, este Joven tiene 1 hijo de la edad de 2 a\u00f1os y recientemente no estudia, su compa\u00f1era de vida labora de comerciante, sus prop\u00f3sitos son de aumentar su negocio en una variedad de productos y proporcionar variedad para ofrecer a sus clientes que en sus deseos esta realizarle mejoras a su vivienda ya que tiene que dejarle a su hijo su casa para que este no sufra necesidades para el d\u00eda de ma\u00f1ana, tambi\u00e9n en sus prop\u00f3sitos esta proporcionarle a su hijo un futuro en los estudios ya que quiere darle una buena educaci\u00f3n y proporcionarle la educaci\u00f3n que necesita para su formaci\u00f3n.\n\n\nLa actividad econ\u00f3mica a la que se dedica es la comerciante y vende los productos como: carne de pollo, carne de res y granos b\u00e1sicos, el tiempo que tiene de poseer su negocio es de 3 a\u00f1os, el inicia este negocio por su familia desde muy peque\u00f1o Denis ayudaba a su familia en el negocio al paso del tiempo su familia deciden que Denis administre el negocio y es as\u00ed como pasa a formar de el por lo que decide realizar financiamientos para que su negocio obtenga toda la variedad de sus productos y poderle proporcionar a los clientes lo que ellos necesitan, el financiamiento es para capital de trabajo por lo que necesita aumentar su producci\u00f3n en sus productos de carne como lo es de pollo y de res y los grano b\u00e1sicos ya que en estos d\u00edas festivos requieren de ambos productos necesarios para el consumo diario y agradece trabajar con la Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 y las organizaciones amigas que le brindan este tipo de oportunidad para que siga adelante.\n","en":"The young entrepreneur Denis Leonel G.

He also wants to make home improvements, so that he can leave his home to his son someday and his son won't have to suffer from unmet needs tomorrow. He would also like to provide his son with an academic future by offering him the good education that he needs in his formative years. \r\n<p> Denis works in commerce selling products like chicken, beef and staple grains. He has had his business for the past three years, and originally founded it to help his family. Since he was very young, Denis has helped his family with their business, and as the years went by they decided to turn the administration of their business over to Denis. Denis then decided to start taking out loans in order to begin offering a wider variety of products and give his clients everything they need. He will use his loan as working capital to help him increase his production of chicken, beef and staple grains for the holiday season. He is grateful to Fundacion Leon 2000 and its partner organizations for offering him this opportunity to continue moving forward. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":244617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-12-23T03:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Denis Leonel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69.12,"local_amount":1352.94,"processed_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1372.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858694},{"amount":69.12,"local_amount":1352.94,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1372.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399949},{"amount":253.71,"local_amount":4966.26,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5037.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091935},{"amount":102.34,"local_amount":2003.27,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2031.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445943},{"amount":99.87,"local_amount":1954.96,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1982.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956588},{"amount":580.84,"local_amount":11369.63,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":11532.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174016}],"funded_date":"2008-12-26T06:06:00Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":85085,"name":"Faten","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faten is a 37-year-old married woman with five children, living in Bourj Barajneh.

R. is 45 years old and married to a tri-bike (a bicycle with sidecar attached to its body) driver, Angelo R.. She has four children who range in age from 4 to 25 years old. Her eldest child is a college undergraduate and now works as a supply officer for the newest and the biggest shopping mall in the province of Antique. It was not so long ago that Rodita was receiving financial assistance from her eldest child, since her businesses started just recently. Her 21-year-old second child is a high school undergraduate and is unemployed. Therefore, three of Rodita\u2019s children are dependent on her and her husband for financial support, with two children still studying in elementary school and preschool. \r\n<p>\r\nRodita\u2019s membership in ASHI, beginning in 2001, has been a great opportunity for her to improve the economy of her family. Through ASHI, she has been able to access credit which has allowed her to enact her thoughts and skill in running her own business. With her membership and previous loans, she has started a food vending business, a pig raising business, and a tri-bike for public transportation business. The first two businesses are managed by Rodita herself. The tri-bike business is managed by her husband.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the villages of the municipality of Hamtic, where Rodita and her family live, tri-bike is the most common means of transportation. However, this can only serve for short distance travel. For far and hilly places, tricycle (a motorcycle with sidecar attached to its body) is the municipality's other means of transportation. A tricycle is much more expensive than a tri-bike; however, owners make a bigger income. With Rodita\u2019s present loan, she will be purchasing a tricycle for a tricycle-for-hire business to be managed by her husband. She plans to hire a driver for her tri-bike.

They began this business over 26 years ago and operates it all the way to the Andean plateaus where the maca root grows.  Felicia bought this product in order to resell them at local markets.  Beforehand, the idea of making maca root flour was suggested because the product would sell at a higher price.  The process of making maca root flour is to dry the product under the sun, turning the maca from time to time.  Afterwards, they are crushed by hand using an artisan grinder; the result of which is maca root flour.  She has a great desire to overcome obstacles, as such she is now thinking of using the same process to make carrot flour.  She plans to use the loan that she is requesting to purchase maca root to dehydrate.

middle son and her daughter-in-law. She is a mother of three sons - her oldest son is married and lives separately, her youngest son lives and studies in Bishkek (the capital of Kyrgyzstan).\r\n\r\nSvetlana was born in a large family of a cattleman with five children. She is the youngest daughter. After graduating from school Svetlana enrolled in a technical school in the town of Tokmok in they Chuysk province of the Kyrgyz Republic to become a librarian. After she finished her studies Svetlana came back to her home village and began working in the local library, but because of the financial hardship she also got a job in the local farm as a milkmaid. Her future husband was also working there as a small truck driver. They met in 1983 and had married in the same year and a year later their first son was born. Because Svetalana's husband was youngest son in their family, according to the Kyrgyz tradition he is supposed to stay with his parents.\r\n\r\nIn 1987 and 1989 in the Onobasov family two more boys were born. In the beginning it was very hard for Svetlana and her husband - because of the collapse of the farm she and Siyazbek were left without jobs and decided to start their own business. They used the plot of land which was given to them earlier by the farm to grow cereals and used the profit gained from the sale of the harvest to buy cattle. Right now in Svetlana's household there are three cows, five male and four female calves, and three horses. During the past several years Svetlana had many expenses which had to do with the weddings of her older sons and tuition fees for her youngest son's education in the university, so she has come to ask for a loan in the amount of 40,000 soms (KGS) to buy a milk cow. Svetlana plans to further increase the headcount of the cattle and developing her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Bai-Tushum and Partners:\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

Gari is a Ghanaian staple \u2013 a type of flour made from cassava. To prepare the gari, she gets raw, fresh cassavas from the market. She washes and peels the cassavas, and then sends them to the mill to be milled into dough. She puts the dough in a sack and places heavy stones on it. The stones are placed to drain the starch out of the dough. She leaves the dough for a day or two depending on the weight of the stones. After this process, she stirfries the gari in a pan on a fire. The gari is then left to cool and bagged into small bags for sale. \r\n\r\nGari is a starchy food in Ghana that is mostly enjoyed by students and large families. Students eat gari a lot because it is a quick and easy food to prepare. They soak gari mix with condensed milk and water, and sometimes add peanuts. Some students also prepare gari in the form of dough and eat it with pepper sauce and sardines. Families also eat gari for lunch or supper, usually served with soup or pepper sauce. The soups that are mostly accompanied with gari are okra soup, groundnut (peanut) soup, palm nut soup, and vegetable soup. Various sauces can also be used to accompany gari such as pepper sauce, curry sauce, and tomato sauce. The variety of the sauce served with the gari depends on the family\u2019s preferences.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":23309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of farm products;

has always been devoted to work and thus acquired a useful piece of knowledge, that she now applies to her life and teaches to her children as well. With great diligence and creativity, she has seeked the way to create businesses and provide services that have helped her advance in life. When she was young, she used to travel to different cities to sell several items, such as clothes and cosmetics. When she got married, she had to stay at home, so she decided to offer her products to her neighbors. When her husband died, the need became pressing and pushed her into a worrying financial crisis, as she was burdened with the responsibility of providing for her little children on her own. In spite of this situation, she continued performing different crafts, as opportunities presented themselves. She was often forced to accept work that required great physical effort. After putting up a tough fight, Aquilina is satisfied to see her children have become people who can stand for themselves and face critical situations of need. She presently lives with only two of her daughters, both single mothers. The wish of this hardworking mother, who spends long hours doing laundry for her clients, is to acquire a laundry machine, in order to reduce the physical effort and soon be able to open a laundry to offer services to the whole community.    \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nAquilina siempre ha estado dedicada al trabajo y adquiri\u00f3 una ense\u00f1anza de valor que ahora aplica en su vida misma e impuls\u00f3 a que aprendan sus hijos; as\u00ed, con mucha diligencia y creatividad, busca la forma de crear negocios y servicios que la ayudan a sobresalir. Desde su juventud viajaba a distintas ciudades para vender diferentes art\u00edculos tales como prendas de vestir, cosm\u00e9ticos, etc. Cuando se cas\u00f3 ya no pudo dedicarse a este negocio de la misma manera, por lo que decidi\u00f3 ofertarlos a sus vecinas; sin embargo, la necesidad fue a\u00fan m\u00e1s apremiante cuando su esposo falleci\u00f3 y ten\u00eda la responsabilidad de velar por sus peque\u00f1os, ahora sin ayuda y compa\u00f1\u00eda.

He is confident that he will be able to pay it back soon, and then ask for another one to finish building his house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":391761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-22T21:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.66,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel Juliao","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":439.43},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":459.29},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":480.05},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":501.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":524.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":548.14},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":572.92},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":598.82},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":625.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":654.18},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":683.76},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":714.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":746.97},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":780.74},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":816.03},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":852.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.48},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.22},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.82},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.49},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.47},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.53},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.65},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.8},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.01},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.61},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.21,"local_amount":858.9,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":867.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971842},{"amount":24.2,"local_amount":645.45,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":651.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816781},{"amount":27.33,"local_amount":728.76,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":735.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708963},{"amount":28.96,"local_amount":772.3,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":779.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938009},{"amount":58.41,"local_amount":1557.59,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-19T07:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938010},{"amount":33.15,"local_amount":929.44,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":938.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.7,"payment_id":136698567},{"amount":64.42,"local_amount":1847.18,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1865.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.85,"payment_id":151915992},{"amount":86.66,"local_amount":2660.38,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2686.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.11,"payment_id":159878444}],"funded_date":"2009-09-22T23:14:14Z","paid_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Lucca","image":259290}},{"id":142518,"name":"Nabihan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Navihan is 50 years old and lives with his wife and two children, a daughter aged 23 and a son aged 18, in a house in the Bayan-Ulgii province of western Mongolia.

She lives with her husband and children in a traditional family with several other families in the Hamdallaye district of the city of S\u00e9gou (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Mariam didn\u2019t have modern schooling.  Rather, she went to a <i>medersa<\/i>, which she quit in the 7th year (education system of Mali) in order to learn tailoring.  She started off with a master tailor.  \r\n\r\nAfter five years of apprenticeship, she is rich with practical experience, and she is advancing on her own and has been running this business for ten years now.  She enjoys a good deal of distinction and a large customer base.  Her selling power is due to her enthusiasm, especially her punctuality in fulfilling orders.  In addition to her tailoring trade, she dyes cloth.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about increasing her business capital in order to realize more profits, she turned toward Soro Yiriwaso.  She is on her first individual loan, which she intends to use to buy a CORNA brand sewing machine.  Her supplies are gotten locally.  And sales are made in cash or on credit to customers composed of women and men.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 40,000 francs CFA.  This profit allows her to help her husband and to assist with societal events (baptisms, marriages, etc.)  Her ambition is to open a ready-to-wear clothing store.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from
