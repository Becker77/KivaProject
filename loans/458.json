This is 33 year old Lucy K. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with one child, who is 33 years old. Lucy has been running a milling machine business since 2007. Milling machines are used to grind up grains (maize) to get flour. She does this both for her customers and for herself. She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee. Lucy currently earns about 200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more maize. In the future, she plans to buy another milling machine. Lucy thanks you for your support!\r\n\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":270986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing

He is 52 years old. Pablito is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Pablito owns and operates a charcoal-selling business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from making and selling charcoal to the local community members. Pablito has been engaged in his business for more than two years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Pablito joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Pablito is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional  materials. This will be the first loan taken out by Pablito from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisher folks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

in Takeo province. She is a Khmer cake maker. Her husband, Mr. Heng Soeun, is a farmer and cultivates rice on a piece of land he owns. The couple also acts as a rice middle-man. Since their business is doing well, they want to expand it by purchasing more rice to re-sell to earn more income. Thus, Mrs. Sokhom T. decided to ask for a loan for this purpose. She is 49 years old and the mother of three children, two of whom are enrolled in the local school, while the youngest is too young to work or study. Mr. Heng Soeun came to request the loan, so he is presented in the picture instead of Mrs. Sokhom T.. \r\n\r\nOnly one member in this group has an end-of-term loan, while the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor, as they allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":400919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more rice to re-sell to earn more income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sokhom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sochea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arnn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.3},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.3},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.3},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":128.59,"local_amount":533400,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":536852.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103738863},{"amount":64.29,"local_amount":266700,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":268426.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110626444},{"amount":64.3,"local_amount":266700,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":268426.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118023201},{"amount":64.29,"local_amount":266700,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":268426.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123861880},{"amount":76.35,"local_amount":316700,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":318750.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128894659},{"amount":64.37,"local_amount":267000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T07:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":268728.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137011771},{"amount":88.3,"local_amount":366300,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":368671.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151839103},{"amount":124.51,"local_amount":516500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":519843.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151841036}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T11:29:58Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:14:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tiffany S.","image":1008207}},{"id":146252,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is a 25-year-old married woman with four children aged between three and nine years; all of her children are currently in school.

She is married and has 5 children, all of whom are school-aged.  This is why she began working with paper products and making crafts (shapes made of foam, felt, and other materials).  She began more than three years ago, since her husband works in a food warehouse as a loader and his income is not enough to cover the family's needs.  She chose this line of work to avoid neglecting the education and care of her children--which is her main priority, and she desires to see her children studying.  She needs more capital  to invest in her business, in order to generate higher earnings and be able to buy a computer to help her print her own designs for her crafts.

He is married and has four daughters; the youngest one is three years old. Akylbek has a very united family, where all members help and support each other.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, in order to find a way to earn a living to support his family, Akylbek decided to begin his business. Experience showed that he was most successful in the trade sector. He engaged in garment-reselling with a starting capital of 8,000 KGS. Due to Akylbek\u2019s strong efforts and tireless endeavor, he managed to enlarge his assortment of goods with various high-quality products.  In 2008, Akylbek took a loan from Bai Tushum and Partners to set up a second sales point at the local market for selling children's and adults\u2019 shoes. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Akylbek lost his business, which was burned to ashes during violent clashes, caused by deposed political regime which broke out in the city of Osh in June 2010.   But Akylbek, being a very optimistic and hard-working person, didn\u2019t give up and is doing his best to rise from the ruins.  \r\n\r\nAkylbek is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS to resume his lost business and continue his activities. It will allow him further development of his household and business. Akylbek believes that mutual understanding and friendship always lead to prosperity and well-being. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

Being a good mother, she always wanted to support her children in whatever career they would be taking to better their own personal life. \r\n\r\nAside from her farming business financed by the loan she received from ASHI, she also sells  different small goods, which is her way of saving her profits to support the needs of her family, especially in the education of her children. With that, Christine is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders to be able to purchase fertilizers, rice seeds \u201cpalay\u201d, and support her second venture. This would make their business grow and make more profit, which will enable her to reach her ambition in life.\r\n\r\nHer long-term goals are for her three children to complete college and find better employment in the future. Education is their priority. This is the only wealth she can leave to her children that others can\u2019t steal. The couple\u2019s looking forward to that soon changing their lives, which are currently in poverty.  Aside from aiming to get out of poverty, they are also dreaming of the best in life that lives together and happily forever. \r\n\r\nChristine is glad to be a Kiva borrower and grateful for Kiva offering loans to support her business efforts.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":643191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase

They have 4 children together, and they raise and educate them in a rented house located in the city of Tarma. She has been buying and selling potatoes for the last 11 years in a stand that she rents at the wholesale market in her city. Every day from the early morning, she sells an average of 40 sacks of potatoes at 45 PEN each. Her job is both arduous and gratifying. What Gissela likes most is negotiating deals on the different varieties of potatoes that she sells. At the end of the day, she feels exhausted from her hectic day.

Valentina, as her greenhouse business calls for new investments again: Valentina needs to finish building one greenhouse and to alter another one.  Valentina would also like to buy good-quality seeds, coal, and additional quantities of protective film.\r\nThanks to the profits made last season, Valentina and her family have been able to afford small home repairs, install new windows, and buy a used car, a VAZ-2106 (Lada).

On average their clothes sell for about US$10 each. They are seeking a loan to buy more thread, fabric, and dye from Asuncion. They need to buy more dye because they take the neutral color fabric that they purchase and dye it into different colors in order to make a variety of women's clothing.

They are neighbors who have united to form a group eligible for credit. They are of humble origins but while their homes may be modest, they are clean and well kept. Their businesses are based in their homes, where they make everything they sell as vendors at the markets of Managua and Masaya. Thanks to the loans they have received from ADIM, El Manzano's members have been able to overcome their feelings of insecurity and financial uncertainty and finally feel able to take control of their lives. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Lilliam, for example, has been working in the markets since she was a child, selling clothes with her older sister. When Lilliam married, her husband gave her a little money so that she could start her own clothing business, but it is only currently, with the help of ADIM, that she truly has access to working capital. \r\n\r\nWith these loans, each member of the group hopes to see their business grow. Additionally, they would like to invest in improving their houses, but this is a long term goal. In order to achieve their dreams, they will continue to make punctual payments on their loans and save what they can from their incomes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":242753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital, business expansion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Nindiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.004722 -86.119444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2008-12-20T21:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esteban Agust\u00edn ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilliam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10058.8,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2011.76},{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2011.76},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2011.76},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2011.76},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2011.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":2011.76,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2078.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9891095},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2011.76,"processed_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2078.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14814369},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2011.76,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2078.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14814370},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2011.76,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2078.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349250},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2011.76,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-28T07:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2078.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349251}],"funded_date":"2008-12-21T13:53:00Z","paid_date":"2009-03-28T07:59:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Sultan","image":null}},{"id":84729,"name":"Soun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. L., 29, raises pigs and chickens for sale in his village of Sanday in Siem Reap Province.

El dinero que est\u00e1 solicitando es para adquirir nueva mercader\u00eda, y con ella regresar a la feria de su localidad, ya que en las \u00faltimas oportunidades, por tener menos prendas, solo vend\u00eda por su barrio.","en":"Maritza is 34 years old. She lives with her 17 year-old son in her mother\u2019s house. She sells clothing as a street vendor in the city\u2019s market. She prefers to sell on Sundays, since the possibility of making sales is greatest on this day. She always counts on her son\u2019s help to carry the packages of merchandise that she transports. She began with this 5 years ago, and so far the business has been profitable. This is what motivates her to continue increasing her working capital. This the second time she has had a loan with MFP and she is certain that she will stay with her communal bank because she likes working with all of the group\u2019s members. The loan she is requesting is to purchase new merchandise. With new merchandise she can return to selling in her town\u2019s market; the last few times she only sold in her neighborhood because she didn\u2019t have many items of clothing to sell.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":330394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-07T22:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":300.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990711},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":300.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211813},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":300.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641338},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":300.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080777},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":300.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996917},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":300.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842257},{"amount":400,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-22T09:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1202,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733881}],"funded_date":"2009-06-22T10:36:15Z","paid_date":"2010-01-22T09:38:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":117497,"name":"Dilorom","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"    MLF \u201cMicroInvest\u201d is one of the leading microfinance organizations, rendering credit services to the population of Tajikistan.

Elia is the coordinator for her group, Saray y Responsabilidad, and her story is representative of the other borrowers in the group.<p>\r\n\r\nElia lives in La Habana, a neighborhood in the city of San Pedro. She lives with her two teenage children and is also raising her niece. Elia runs a small colmado from her home. Colmados are small corner stores that sell food, drinks and general household products for the residents in the neighborhood. Elia\u2019s colmado focuses on food only, and she sells the basics of the Dominican cuisine: rice, beans, plantains, sugar, flour and oil. <p>\r\n\r\nSan Pedro is a small city with many amenities. Unfortunately, there are several neighborhoods which lack access to those amenities. La Habana is one of those neighborhoods. Most of the city has running water, somewhat reliable electricity, and decent waste management, but La Habana lacks all of these.

Lucio es un hombre muy luchador que ha trabajado desde los 8 a\u00f1os de edad. Fue su padre quien le ense\u00f1\u00f3 primeramente el oficio de la alfarer\u00eda (elaboraci\u00f3n de ladrillos de barro, tejas, etc). A la edad de 25 a\u00f1os de edad, Don Lucio contrae matrimonio con su actual esposa.  Desde entonces \u00e9l le lleva el sustento a su familia por medio de la agricultura. Fue as\u00ed que poco a poco Don Lucio y su esposa han logrado tener un pedacito de tierra en donde cultivan. El terreno est\u00e1 ubicado a dos kil\u00f3metros y medio de su casa. Para llegar ah\u00ed solo lo pueden hacer a pie, caminando por veredas angostas en donde hay arbustos espinosos.Cuando ya tiene la cosecha, Don Lucio carga el maiz en su espalda para llevarlo hasta su casa, cruzando todas las veredas. Luego, \u00e9l lleva el maiz en una carreta o en bus a venderlo en el pueblo m\u00e1s cercano. Todo este esfuerzo \u00e9l lo hace con amor para su familia ya que es de esta forma como \u00e9l puede llevarles el sustento diario. Don Lucio se levanta todos los d\u00edas a las 4:00 de la ma\u00f1ana y termina a las 8:00 p.m. Cada a\u00f1o, Don Lucio almacena una parte de su cosecha en graneros y eso le sirve como materia prima para el siguiente a\u00f1o. Por esta raz\u00f3n, \u00e9l no tiene que comprar la semilla para sembrar, aunque si tiene que comprar fertilizantes, herbicidas y pesticidas.\n\nPara seguir trabajando, Don Lucio est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo para la compra de fertilizantes, pesticidas y herbicidas para la cosecha de ma\u00edz; y tambi\u00e9n para la compra de \u00e1rboles de chile guaco. El quiere sembrar chile en el terreno de su casa para as\u00ed tener un ingreso adicional con la venta de los chiles. \n\nCon respecto al beneficio del pr\u00e9stamo, Don Lucio manifiesta con sus propias palabras lo siguiente: \u201ctendr\u00e9 el pan de cada d\u00eda, tendr\u00e9 vestuario para mi familia, tendr\u00e9 salud y amor en el hogar por la satisfacci\u00f3n de que el pr\u00e9stamo ayudo a realizar mi objetivo y que Fundaci\u00f3n Campo siempre ayuda al m\u00e1s pobre.\u201d\n\nEl deseo de Don Lucio es mejorar la calidad de vida de su familia. El quiere que sus hijos tengan un buen ejemplo de sus padres. El quiere que sus hijos aprendan que con esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n se puede vencer cualquier obst\u00e1culo, por muy dif\u00edcil que parezca, y que la mejor forma de ganarse la vida es trabajando.\n","en":"Se\u00f1or Lucio is 61 years old, and lives with his wife and five children.\r\n\r\nDon Lucio is a very hard-working man, who has been working since he was 8 years old.  It was his father who first taught him how to work in pottery (making mud bricks, tiles, etc.)  At the age of 25, Don Lucio married his current wife.  Since then, he has supported his family by means of agriculture.  Little by little, Don Lucio and his wife have been able to get a small piece of land which they cultivate.  The land is located two and a half kilometers from their home, and can only be reached on foot by walking through narrow paths with thorn bushes. When it's harvest time, Don Lucio carries the corn on his shoulders along the paths to bring it back to his home.  Then he brings the corn in a cart or on a bus to a village that's very close by, where he sells it.  He makes all this effort out of love for his family, and in this way he is able to provide them with their daily bread.\r\n\r\nDon Lucio gets up at 4 a.m. every day, and finishes working at 8:00 p.m.  Every year, Don Lucio stores a part of his harvest in the granary, and uses it as starting material for the following year.  For this reason, he doesn't need to buy seeds for sowing, although he still needs to buy fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides.\r\n\r\nTo continue with his work, Don Lucio is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for the purchase of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides for his corn crop, and also to purchase guaco chili plants.

Before joining the TYM Fund, her family's income came mainly from farming, livestock and her husband's income as a hired worker. After joining the Fund, she had more capital to invest in buying and selling poultry. Her first loan of 1,000,000VND (about 66USD) was used to purchase poultry from various poultry farms and resell them in wet market and kiosks. This business has brought about a substantial source of income for her family. Currently, her husband and children also help her in this business. Everyday, her husband and children buy poultry and resell them to various restaurants, while she sells them in the market. With the experiences obtained in 8 years, she is able to improve her family's economy, and her family's monthly income is now 4,000,000VND (266USD). This time, she would like to borrow 925USD to expand her business.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb L\u00fd n\u0103m nay 51 tu\u1ed5i,gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 3 con \u0111\u00e3 tr\u01b0\u1edfng th\u00e0nh.Tr\u01b0\u1edbc khi tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng thu nh\u1eadp c\u1ee7a gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb ch\u1ee7 y\u1ebfu d\u1ef1a v\u00e0o ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i, tr\u1ed3ng tr\u1ecdt v\u00e0 ti\u1ec1n \u0111i l\u00e0m thu\u00ea c\u1ee7a ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb .

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A few years later, he started doing revenue-generating work during the slow periods.  \r\n\r\nToday, his commercial work has surpassed farming.  For six years now, he has been in business buying and selling grains (millet, corn, fonio, rice, etc.)   This business operates in town, and some of the goods are sold at the Bougouni marketplace when the fair takes place.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about expanding his enterprise, he decided to join Soro Yiriwaso, with which he is now on his third individual loan after having repaid the two previous ones.  This new loan will be used to buy sacks of grain a little at a time.  Supplies are gotten from producers from villages surrounding Bougouni.  And sales are made in cash at the retail level to customers composed of retailers and consumers.  \r\n\r\nHe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 75,000 francs CFA.  With the profits, he envisions expanding his enterprise further.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":421620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy grain ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-11-09T22:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hamadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":287.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":126771.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991206},{"amount":287.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":126771.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778835},{"amount":287.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:01Z","rounded_local_amount":126771.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913246},{"amount":287.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":126771.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476500}],"funded_date":"2009-11-20T01:50:49Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":154557,"name":"Corazon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Corazon G. is from the village of Maac, Guinsiliban, Camiguin Province.

He has already taken the first step in painting the walls of the rooms and he says that he doesn't have much left to do.\r\n\r\nThis is Gerardo's eighth loan from MFP and he is certain that he will be able to get ahead with the help of his community bank where they teach him to plan and save.  Gerardo will use his loan to buy the material he needs to fix up his bathroom and, in this way, begin his new project."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":680469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy material to remodel his bathroom","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-01T14:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gerardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.2,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":70.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463713},{"amount":25.2,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":70.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887096},{"amount":25.36,"local_amount":63.4,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":70.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327457},{"amount":25.04,"local_amount":62.6,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":70.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196004},{"amount":25.2,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":70.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269688},{"amount":25.2,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":70.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549688},{"amount":25.2,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":70.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718391},{"amount":23.6,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":66.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349950}],"funded_date":"2011-01-02T01:50:22Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":265870,"name":"Sofia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cMADRES TRABAJADORAS\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cBackground:  The 'balayeuses' or sweepers number 65 members and are divided into four smaller groups.  They often suffer from the lack of financial resources.  The sweepers take charge of improving living conditions by regularly sweeping the streets and main boulevard of their neighborhood, because the local government does not provide garbage collection services. With time, this citizen practice of taking responsibility for improving local living conditions has spread like an oil stain to the surrounding localities.<p>\r\n\r\nObjective:  To support these women in their retail trading activities.  <p>\r\n\r\nSpecific objective:  To provide the members of this group with the resources they need to strengthen their trading activities, allowing them to continue their neighborhood cleaning services as well.<p>\r\n\r\nBrief description of the activities to be financed by the loan:  The members of this group engage in retail sale of all types of common consumption items [i.e. food products, clothing, etc.].  With the loan funds, the group will buy such products in bulk and resell them among the members of their association and to other customers, and the profits earned from all these transactions will be used to repay the loan and to reinforce the purchasing power of the group.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n<p>\r\nOriginal French business description:<p>\r\n\r\n\u00ab Contexte du projet :Les balayeuses sont au  nombre de 65 membres reparties dans quatre petits groupement, elles souffrent le plus souvent de la raret\u00e9 des ressources financi\u00e8res.

After joining the Fund, she has boldly borrowed money to invest in doing business.  Being a quick-minded, smart woman, she easily familiarized herself with the details of business and trading.  To date, she has become a woman who is very experienced with dealing in agricultural products.  This business helped the family\u2019s finances become more stable.  Besides this business, she also worked with her son and daughter-in-law to raise chickens and fish.  The family\u2019s quality of life is getting better day by day.  In this round of funding she is requesting 10,000,000 VND to invest in her business.

He hopes that his business will continue to churn out a high quality product.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":381445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Operating capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-09-02T05:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Joaquin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:54:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87036152},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:36:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948561},{"amount":0.51,"local_amount":10.11,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":10.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790564},{"amount":50.26,"local_amount":1005.22,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1030.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790565},{"amount":49.86,"local_amount":997.22,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1021.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110681136},{"amount":49.37,"local_amount":987.45,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1011.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075666},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911684}],"funded_date":"2009-09-02T08:02:05Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":138060,"name":"Sam Try Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hawa B.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Ramzi wants to purchase a new rickshaw in order to work extra hours and increase the family income, but the amount of money he has isn't sufficient. He is therefore requesting a loan from FATEN, to be repaid monthly which, when combined with his savings, will enable Ramzi to make the purchase and help  him to improve his family's living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout This Loan Product:<p>\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. <p>\r\n\r\nFor more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

R.E.C. Primary School Waterloo was founded in 1926 by the government. R.E.C Waterloo has a total number of 546 pupils and a total number of fourteen staff. \r\n\r\nSince 2006, when Nafisatu A. T. took over the administration of the school, R.E.C Primary School Waterloo has been producing good results at the National Primary School Exams (NPSE). However, like many schools in Sierra Leone, REC Waterloo lacks adequate classrooms, seating accommodations and adequate learning and teaching materials.\r\n\r\nThis will be the first loan for teachers of the R.E.C Primary School from SMT\/Kiva. Government salaries are usually quite small for teachers, thus making teaching an unattractive profession for many whose primary motivator is money. Many choose other jobs over teaching because of the small salary, thus starving the field of qualified personnel to teach the children. The few who remain in the classrooms have to find other ways of making ends meet. The vast majority of them engage in either businesses or agriculture or they provide extra tutorial classes for the children (although this is a practice the government is trying to stop).\r\n<p>\r\nNeedless to say, loans from SMT are a great help to the teachers in order to boost their businesses or investing it in something productive. Many want to go to school but could not afford the cost. Some will want to buy pieces of furniture, but their monthly salary is not enough to let them do so. With a loan, they will be able to meet some of these needs.  And with their monthly salaries, they can repay easily via a payroll deduction type of system.\r\n\r\nNafisatu A. T. (left) is the head teacher of R.E.C Primary School Waterloo. She was born in Matotoka village, Tonkolili district, northern Sierra Leone.  She is fifty-four years of age and married with four children. One is already an adult and three are still attending schools. She has been a teacher for thirty-six years now. Nafisatu will use this loan to buy bundles of corrugated iron zinc to roof her house.  She does not expect to complete the roofing of her house with this loan, but with subsequent loans, however, she will certainly complete the roofing of her house.

Ulmasoy is 40 years old, widowed and has three children. The difficult circumstances and hardships in her life made her recognize the value of work from a very young age. For about seven years she has been buying young sheep and calves in the local market, fattening and selling them. Ulmasoy is a very hardworking woman, and her diligence is incredible. She works with strength worthy of immense admiration. She has always looked for a way to be an important protagonist by providing extra income in her home. Ulmasoy wakes up early every morning to feed her cows and bulls, with the goal of fattening them and selling them at the best price in the local market. She started this occupation because of the recommendation and teaching of her beloved mother. Thanks to this activity she is helping to provide her children with an education. Ulmasoy wants to keep educating them because she hopes that they\u2019ll reach the goals that they have laid out for themselves. For this purpose, she is requesting a loan of 6,000 TJS to buy calves in order to expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He lives with his common-law wife, Elena, 39 years old. From their relationship they have 2 children, Judith, 15, and Antony, 6. They all live together in a house which they own. Luis started his adventure as an agriculturist when he was a young boy, working on his parents' land. His passion for agriculture brought him to acquire his own land and today he has worked independently for 18 years. He cultivates coffee and cocoa on the 10 hectares of land that he has. During the harvest season he hires farmhands to help him harvest the product quicker. This way he manages to complete his work at a greater pace. He is very committed to his business. And it is thanks to this business that today he enjoys watching his plants yield better products, earning better profits for each kilogram that he sells. When the winter season arrives he must take care to avoid insects from harming his plantations. The constant rain also impedes his work. This is his 12th loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and he is ready to make his payments on time as he wishes to access future loans. With the loan that he requests he will purchase fertilizer for his land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":760450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizers for his land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-29T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1060.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385301}],"funded_date":"2011-04-30T08:55:43Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":298688,"name":"Livingstone","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Livingstone is 30 years old.

M. is a single mother of two young girls. Like many young women in Kenya and in Africa at large, she is a primary school dropout due to lack of money to pay for her fees. She started her business in the year 2001 with initial capital of four dollars from her husband. They have since divorced. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of $300, she plans to increase her stock of assorted household items. Mirriam's business even takes her to the neighbouring country of Uganda. She sells household goods such as blankets, cooking pans, detergents, etc. at reasonable prices from Kenya.<p>\r\n\r\nMiriam depends on her business for her livelihood and to educate her daughters and pay for their general living expenses. She is an optimist and believes in what she is doing. She looks forward to opening a shop in Mbale, Uganda one day. <P>\r\n\r\nMirriam's hard work is an inspiration for others in her community.

Carmen was born in San Ignacio, in the province of Cajamarca, and she lived with only her father and brothers because her mother abandoned the family when Carmen was a child. (It is only within the past five years that she has met her mother). <p>\r\nAt the age of 14 Carmen fled from her house with some friends because her father was abusing her.  She came to Trujillo to work as a maid, and at 16 became pregnant and had to leave her job (she has since married the child\u2019s father).  She then dedicated herself to washing clothes and later her sister-in-law gave her the idea of selling candy, and that\u2019s how she started in this activity. <p>\r\nCurrently she lives in the settlement \u201cRam\u00f3n Castilla\u201d of the district Huanchaco in Trujillo and she works selling candy during the school year at the entrance to a school located in the center of the city of Trujillo.  During vacations and on the weekends she sells candy in the Plaza de Armas and also at the hotsprings of Huanchaco. <p>\r\nShe obtained her first loan of S\/300 (approximately $100) as part of the group Mientras Tanto \u201cSol Radiante\u201d with which she purchased candy in order to stock her cart.  Recently she has requested a loan from Manuela Ramos for S\/700.00 (approximately $234) to be paid back in four months, with which she will buy some soft drinks and toys which she plans to sell during Christmas Vacation.

(Greetings!) from Tanzania! Pictured here is 27 year-old Veronica M. from Mwanza. She is married with two children who are between the ages of one and four. Additionally, she is is mother to one orphan.\r\n\r\nVeronica has been running a tailoring business since 2006. She sells clothes mainly for women. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, five days per week and is assisted by her husband. Veronica currently earns about 100 USD a month from her business. \r\n\r\nNow, she is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print) and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides). She plans to use these materials to design clothing mainly for women. In the future, she plans to increase her stocks. Veronica thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

She is 57 years old. Teotima is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Teotima owns & operates a business raising pigs for sale. Teotima has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Teotima joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teotima has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Teotima chose to request a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby pigs to raise & sell in the future. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Teotima from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
