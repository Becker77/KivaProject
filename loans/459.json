She grows peas, potatoes and beans which she sows on her own land which is located on the outskirts of her village.

For this reason, she also raises livestock, taking care of animals such as rams, guinea pigs and cows.  This makes her extra profits that she uses to cover any problems with her farming.  \"Money invested in growing crops is not always safe.  Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose\" she tells us.  For this reason, she is saving money so that she can start her own business where she can feel more relaxed. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a member of the Santa Rosa community bank and this is her seventh loan from MFP.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Karena kebanyakan memang di pedesaan termasuk juga di desa Perancak memelihara babi merupakan kerja sampingan para ibu-ibu rumah tangga disamping mengolah ladang. Karena kebutuhan ekonomi dalam keluarga semakin besar dan suaminya yang sebagai petani juga penghasilannya tidak menentu maka Ketut Sumerti melihat peluang bekerja sama dengan DINARI adalah sesuatu yang sangat bagus dan membantunya dalam meningkatkan penghasilan dari beternak babinya. Ketut memutuskan untuk menambah modal usahanya dengan meminjam ke DINARI sebesar Rp.3.750.000,- dengan jangka waktu 6 bulan dan pembayaran dilakukan sekaligus pada akhir periode pinjaman dimana babi-babi peliharaan sudah dapat dipanen. Ketut merencanakan membeli 2 ekor bibit babi penggemukan untuk dipelihara disamping babi-babi yang sudah ada di kandangnya. Sisa pinjaman akan digunakan untuk biaya pakan selama 6 bulan masa pemeliharaan. Untuk mengawali memang cukup sulit karena diharapkan babi-babi peliharaannya semuanya harus panen bagus tetapi dengan pendampingan dari para staf DINARI tentang cara memelihara babi yang baik maka Ketut berharap keuntungan yang akan didapat mencapai sekitar Rp.500.000,-. Tentunya hasil ini sangat membantu keluarga nantinya. Terutama untuk kebutuhan anak-anaknya.","en":"Raising pigs  has been work for Ketut Sumerti before she started her household. In many villages, including  Perancak, raising pigs are side jobs for housewifes besides field work. Since family economy needs are greater, and her tenant farmer's husband income is uncertain, so Ketut Sumerti saw an opportunity to work together with DINARI as a good way to help increase her pig farming income. Ketut decided to increase her capital by borrowing from DINARI for  Rp.3,750,000,-  (Translator\u2019s note: 1 US$ fluctuates between Rp10,000-12,000.00) for a period of 6 months, and payment at period end after the farmed pigs are harvested. Ketut plans to buy 2 piglets for fattening to be raised together with other pigs already in her stall. Rest of the loan will be used to buy pig feeds for the 6 months raising. To start is difficult since it was expected that the raised pigs have all to harvested well, but with DINARI staff training on how to raise pigs well, Ketut hopes that profit received could be about Rp.500,000,-.

In order to deal with this problem, she has decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to support the field and to make her crops more productive. Her husband, Mr. MoeU. Thy, is a fisherman. Mrs. Kim SoeU. C. is 32 years old and the mother of two young children. \r\n\r\nFour members in this group loans have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows tH. to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Life there can be rough with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate healthcare. Despite these difficulties, Maria runs a successful business selling home products to her friends and neighbors. With this loan, Maria will purchase sheet sets to sell for a small profit.\r\n\r\nThis is Maria\u2019s eighth loan with Esperanza International, and she hopes to continue taking out loans to grow her business and improve life for her family. With her profits, she hopes to purchase a small van in order to make her business more mobile. This will add to her profits, which will allow her to improve her home by finishing her bathroom and to purchase a computer for her children. Computers are difficult to afford, but are one of the best investments a low-income household can make. It gives access to the world of information that those of us in the developed world take for granted while teaching children to use the invaluable tools of modern technology. Maria hopes to have her own house one day \u2014 something of value she can pass on to her children.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope. We have over 8,500 active associates in eleven offices in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Thank you for lending to Maria and the Nuevo Renacer group!

She is a hard-working and dynamic woman with a great desire to make progress. She is separated, but she lives with her mother and her two children, aged 17 and 10, in a house that she owns. Judith's work is tailoring. She makes all kinds of garments in response to orders from her clients, for men, women and children. She learned this profession when she signed up at an occupational education center. She had the economic needs of her household in mind, and she had a sewing machine as a tool, which she was able to acquire thanks to a loan she applied for eight years ago. What she likes about her work is being able to have an income to cover her household expenses, since she is now the only breadwinner in her family. She comments that she likes to sew -- she was already interested in it as a young girl -- and thanks to this opportunity she has a job.

a loan. This is not a gift they are asking for, but a loan from which they can start their own small business. In the area they come from, credit is not readily available unless they borrow from a loan shark who charges unreasonable interest. In the immense poverty they live in, it is hard to find jobs and hard to support a family. For that reason Mujeres en Gloria are hoping to receive a loan and start their own business. This group is ready to work to try and break the chains of poverty.\r\n\r\nIsaura N. is the group leader and their representative, and she is very excited about being given the honor. She lives with her husband and her one child. She has not had an easy life. She has had to live in extreme poverty her entire life. Isaura received a high school education, which is more than most in her area. She knows that education is something that is very important if you want to break out of poverty, and for that reason she dreams of sending her child to a university someday. Isaura has a small food stand where she sells items she cooks, but with a loan she will be able to increase the variety of food she sells, and hopefully increase her profit. She is an intelligent, hard working woman who wants nothing more than to improve the life of her child. She is ready to expand her business and is excited about the opportunity. She knows this is the first step in achieving her dream of putting her child through college, and she is ready to take the first step.

The group members are from the town of Quillabamba, about five hours from the city of Cusco in the province of La Convencion. Quillabamba is referred to as the \u201ceyebrow of the jungle.\u201d The climate is hot and humid, and the area produces many of the bananas, oranges and papayas that are consumed in Cusco. \r\n\r\nThe group members are involved in a variety of different activities. For example, Hilda is 32 years old and is the single mother of one child. She and her mother sell prepared lunches at the local market in Quillabamba. For example, today\u2019s meal was noodle soup and fish or pork chops with beans. Hilda starts preparing each day\u2019s meal at 8:30 am. The food is ready by 10 am; then she leaves for the market so that she is ready for each day\u2019s early customers. Hilda also sells perfume by catalog as an extra source of income. She is requesting a loan of 500 soles to buy the perfume that her customers request. She collects payments on a monthly basis. Hilda\u2019s goal for the future is to open her own store and buy a hamburger cart to sell snacks at night. \r\n\r\nHilda\u2019s aunt, Celia, is also a group member. Celia is 45 years old and lives with her partner and their three children. She also has a lunch stand in Quillabamba\u2019s Mercado Sat\u00e9lite, and has been serving meals for the past eight years. Celia is requesting a loan of 1000 soles so that she can put in a cement floor in her home. Her current floor is dirt. \r\n\r\nAnother group member, Maritza, is 31 years old and lives with her partner. She recently started her own business bringing alcohol from Quillabamba to Cusco to sell to stores in the city. She travels every two weeks or so and brings between 110 and 140 kilos of alcohol on each trip. She earns about 50 centimos (17 cents US ) for each kilo she sells, so she earns a total of 50 to 70 soles ($17 to $23) per trip. Maritza is requesting a loan of 1000 soles to buy more alcohol. Each kilo costs 2.35 soles, so her loan will buy her about 425 kilos, enough for 3-4 trips to Cusco.\r\n\r\nLos Diamantes have pledged to repay their loan in full and on time. They are the first group from Quillabamba to be listed on Kiva! Their loan officer, Ramiro, is pictured in the red shirt on the far right. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3825,"image":{"id":322507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy perfume and alcohol, and to install a cement floor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Quillabamba - La Convenci\u00f3n - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3825,"lender_count":114,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yeny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Clotilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Placida Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1748.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1818.79},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1891.54},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1967.21},{"due_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2045.9},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2127.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":576.66},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":599.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":623.72},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":648.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":674.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":701.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":576.73,"local_amount":1749.04,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1756.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918341},{"amount":599.66,"local_amount":1818.58,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:24:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1825.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139183},{"amount":623.72,"local_amount":1891.54,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1899.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564802},{"amount":648.67,"local_amount":1967.21,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T13:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1975.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86998365},{"amount":674.62,"local_amount":2045.9,"processed_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T14:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2054.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96910618},{"amount":701.6,"local_amount":2127.73,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2136.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103749940}],"funded_date":"2009-06-12T23:49:20Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T11:35:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":113885,"name":"Nosiriddin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has six children, with only the youngest dependent on her.  Her other children have their own lives and work independently.  For four years now she has been selling clothing from her home, mostly to farm laborers in the area.  Her husband has a shop where he sells and repairs bicycles.  They also have a three-hectare plot of land, which they rent every year.  She asks for financing for her business at Christmas time, to take advantage of the increase in the sale of clothing and gifts.  Her dream is to have better housing and grow her business and support her youngest child.  Elba and her husband are grateful for the support we can offer to improve their living standard. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva

She produces milk and delivers it to Viloma.  As well as working in agriculture, she is helping three of her children finish school.  Her oldest son is not able to attend school as he had to work from a young age.

Mrs. Damiana is not able to study.  She doesn\u2019t know how to read or write.  Her parents never placed her in school because she had to take care of her younger siblings as she was the oldest.  She suffered a lot because she had many dreams which she was unable to accomplish.  This is why she is working so hard; so her children have a better future and in this was she will be happy because they will be professionals.\r\n\r\nMrs. Damiana is soliciting the loan in order to buy cattle and in this way augment her milk production and have a greater income.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 11,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Dioscora aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.

","en":"This solidarity group is called \"Las Comadres\".  Salustia Dorotea is going to buy chicken, and  feed to fatten chickens.  Blanca Estella  is going to buy eggs, cooking oil, sugar, soft drinks etc. Candelaria is going to buy crates of avocados. Mar\u00eda del Carmen is going to buy cream, cheese, vegetables, meats and soft drinks. \r\n\r\nBlanca Estela is 50, and went to school as far as 4th semester of vocational high school.  She lives in a common-law relationship with her husband, who is a farmer. They have two adult children who are already working and married.  She has a business selling fried tacos, and a grocery store.  She is applying for a loan to buy gas and lard to make fried tacos, as well as sugar, cooking oil, eggs, soap, toilet paper, soft drinks etc. to stock her grocery store.  \r\n\r\nShe started her business 5 years ago because she needed financial resources. Her husband encouraged her, and taught her this business.  With the income that they earned from their work, they bought ingredients and utensils for making fried tacos. She goes out to sell her products on Saturdays, and during the week she fills orders. She offers her customers fried tacos made with potatoes, reques\u00f3n (similar to cottage or ricotta cheese), beef, or pork. \r\n\r\nHer business is important as a source of family income. She's happy with her business, because thanks to it, the whole family eats well. She goes out and sells her tacos, and then has the money to buy food.  She feels proud when her clients tell her that her tacos are delicious.  The competition her business faces is that many ladies copy her, but only sell for a time and then stop. She is is planning to set up a location in the market to sell fried tacos. Her hope is to put a cement and tile floor in her house, and that all her family live well.   \r\n\r\nThe members of the group want to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad: \"Thank you very much for your loans that get us out of difficulties and tight spots.   Thanks to you, we can get ahead as long as the money is used for something productive."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":849578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This loan will allow her to increase her working capital and purchase three bags of ingredients (corn, sorghum). \r\n\r\nHer big challenge is that her receipts are in local currency, the Congolese Franc. However, this is not a stable currency and the inflation is growing, which results in losses when Congolese Francs are exchanged into hard currency (US dollars). Like all locals, distrusting the Congolese currency, Kabira keeps her savings in US dollars. In addition, the production of \u201cMadrakwa\u201d is very labor-intensive, given that she is still using a very rudimentary technology, and thus she would like to change her type of business in the future. She would like to see her children finish their studies. \r\n\r\nThanks to the loans from Hekima, Kabira K. already has made visible progress: her earnings have allowed her to build a house with two bedrooms and a living room; she rents out the house to increase her income. Kabira Kalondera thanks Hekima for assisting impoverished citizens who do not have access to the traditional banking system. It should also be mentioned that the Iraqi group consists of 14 members. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":605415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"3 bags of ingredients (corn, sorghum)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

His shop is located in Wayerma I in Sikasso and he has conducted his business there for about five years.  He is very sought after because of the quality of his products. \r\n\r\nIn order to better satisfy his growing clientele, over three years ago he decided to rejoin the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is on his fifth individual loan.

Currently all the kids are in school. \r\n\r\nShe and her family live in Atebubu. Where they live is a typical farming community, where most settlers do farming, specifically crop farming. But Hawa opts to deal in supplying cloth, a business she started fifteen years ago with an amount of $20 at that time. Now Hawa can boast of its business expansion, which she accomplished with that little seed money with which she started her business. Since that time she has maintained product quality and customer relations. She requests the loan to buy more clothing materials like cloth, linen, and lace. Hawa treks her product to the surrounding communities to sell during their market days. \r\n\r\nThrough the proceeds from her output she has able to build a three-bedroom house with the able help of her husband. She is prepared to sell everything on her to give her kids good quality education. She said she would be grateful for your support. \r\n\r\nHawa belongs to a group in her community known as \u2018Ruth.\u2019 The group members agree to guarantee for one another as social collateral to access the loan and to repay the loan.

Sabe que los esfuerzos que ejerce en el buen cuidado de sus cultivos, son fundamentales para obtener una cosecha productiva, por eso cada ma\u00f1ana contenta se dirige a la chacra para cuidar sus plantaciones de caf\u00e9, pl\u00e1tanos y palta, pensando que su sacrificio ser\u00e1 recompensado. Lleva 25 a\u00f1os labrando la tierra junto a su esposo y ambos practican diferentes t\u00e9cnicas agr\u00edcolas que les dan buenos resultados.

She is married to Donato, 49, and they have 4 children, though only one still lives with them in the home they own. Lucila knows that her work taking care of her crops is crucial to a good harvest, and so every morning she is happy to head for the fields to take care of her coffee, bananas and avocados, thinking that her efforts will be rewarded. She has spent 25 years working the land with her husband, and each of them has their own special methods for getting good results. What Lucila likes most about farming is harvesting the coffee beans. Although it is difficult to get the crop to market in the city and to have it stored, she considers it a very profitable business. It fetches a good price at the market. Lucila is therefore planning to buy additional land where she can increase her coffee production. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with [field partner] MFP, and she can see the economic progress she has made already. She will continue to make her repayments responsibly because she wants to continue accessing credit to help her bsiness grow - and because she enjoys being part of this communal bank. With the loan she is seeking, Lucila will buy sacks of organic fertilizer to spread on her crops and increase productivity.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":581364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-10T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1049.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269255}],"funded_date":"2010-08-10T23:38:24Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":225389,"name":"Laskmi","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal  \u201cPATRON DE SANTIAGO DE SANTIAGO\u201d; Este banco est\u00e1 situado en el distrito de Santiago, perteneciente a la provincia y departamento del Cusco.\n\nLa socia es  la Sra.

While each member of the group gets an individual loan, both are responsible for paying back the entire loan if the other person is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMaricel makes a living by selling snacks to people who live in her community. She has been engaged in this business for almost one year and earns about 1,000 PHP a month from her work\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Maricel joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and her ability to engage in business. Her loan group is  applying for its first loan, and she plans to use her 4,000 PHP portion to buy piglets to raise and later sell. She plans to use the additional income she earns from this loan to improve her family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders. \r\n\r\nAbout Group Loans\r\nIn a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee. Under this arrangement, each member of the group supports one another and is responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or

For her, there are no days off because she must work continually in her field in order to have a good harvest.  The main things she grows are: cocoa beans, coffee and bananas which, once harvested, she takes to sell in various markets in the city of San Francisco.  What she most likes about her work is the freedom she has working her fields because she can freely enjoy the green countryside.  She\u2019s been in this line of work for 7 years and considers the most difficult part of it having to work during the heavy rainy season because rains in this part of the Peruvian Amazon region are continuous.

from Bamenda.  With this loan, Magdalene will continue her business of frying and selling gateau (a doughnut like treat), rearing pigs, and raising fowl.  Her business plan involves the purchase two piglets, 8 kilograms of animal feed, flour, sugar, yeast, oil, 50 chicks, and chicken feed.  She also plans to reinforce her fence with part of this loan.  She plans to use 104,000 CFA (approximately $210 USD) of her own savings to supplement her loan and ensure she has the most success in her businesses.  This loan will be repaid over a period of 18 months; the first payment will be made on the day the loan is dispersed.\r\n\r\n<p>This will be Regina's fourth loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2004.  She plans to sell her fried gateaux to children on their way to school and to farmers in the morning.  As there are many celebrations in the near future, including Christmas and New Years, chickens will be in high demand soon.  She hopes to raise her chickens to sell before these celebrations, as they only take 6 to 8 weeks to become full grown.  Her husband plans to help her raise her pigs and chickens, as he has a great deal of experience in raising animals.  She plans to support her community by providing them with chickens, pigs, fried gateaux, and manure for sale at reasonable prices.  Moreover, by purchasing her supplies, such as oil and pig feed, from her community, she will help to raise the incomes of others in her community.  With the profits from this loan, Magdalene plans to pay her children's school fees. This is extremely important to her as she was unable to continue her education as a child of poverty.  She also plans to improve her household.  Magdalene hopes that this loan will continue to increase her family's standard of living as those in the past have done.  She is grateful for the business training provided by GHAPE, and knows this training will be crucial in the success of her businesses.\r\n\r\n<p>The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount to a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and develops a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.<\/p>

fifth loan to invest in improving her home (whitewashing the house). She has worked at the Hospital Jacinto Hern\u00e1ndez as a supervisor for the past 28 years and she has a grown daughter, for whom she took on the role of both mother and father at an early age. She is very responsible, honest and hard-working, and has striven to improve her home bit by bit, located in the urban center of Nueva Guinea, a recently populated neighborhood and growing daily. Petrona is a woman of high spirits both personally and at work, which she loves. Although her daughter does not live with her, she does take care of her very elderly mother. Her dream is to have stability, health and a nice home.  Petrona is grateful to AFODENIC for the previous loans which helped her slowly build her home and this way she could bring greater comfort to her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

They are hard-working, determined women with a lot of hope for change.  They are women of scarce resources who live a daily fight to support their family.  With the help of their husbands, they have the enthusiasm and the desire to get ahead economically.\r\nEach one of them is requesting a loan between 300,000 and 500,000 guaran\u00eds ($62 to $104).

Maria has a business buying and selling clothing, new as well as used, which she sells in the streets, principally on order to people that she knows.  It should be noted that she works in a beauty salon called the Belleza Luz Marina salon, where she offers her products to her co-workers and customers of the salon.  This business began 5 years ago with very little working capital.  She was searching for a source of alternative income, since she had just had her first child and wanted to provide for him well.  She started out selling cosmetics, after that she started to invest in clothing and accessories; in addition she also sells jewelry, but only on order.  This loan will be invested in the purchase of more clothing, since it is now close to the Christmas season and Maria wants to invest and buy now when the prices are a little lower.

In the past four years the prices for fodder have almost tripled.\r\n\r\nGulnar N. is 56 years old, a leader of this group. She also fell victim to these economic events. Twelve years ago her starting capital was 12000 soms when she bought two calves. For the entire decade the resale of the cattle was stable. However in the past years the hike in prices on hay due to the weather conditions and water shortages made the situation for animal husbandry workers difficult.\r\n\r\nGulnar and her group are very grateful to Kiva for the loan. It is significantly helping her and other members of the group to alleviate themselves from the difficult financial situation. Gulnar has defined he purpose of this loan as for purchase of another calf to increase headcount of cattle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":733258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a calf","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Toktogul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2011-03-17T22:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u041c\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0431\u0435\u043a","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u041c\u044b\u0437\u043a\u0430\u043b","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4040},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4350},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4470},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4608},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4905},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5108},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5255},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5512},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5764},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5988}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.86},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.53},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.1},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.07},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.46},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.98},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.51},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":86.86,"local_amount":4040,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4122.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206192753},{"amount":93.53,"local_amount":4350,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-17T08:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4438.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211571557},{"amount":96.1,"local_amount":4470,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4560.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216546217},{"amount":99.07,"local_amount":4608,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:11:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4701.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221714812},{"amount":105.46,"local_amount":4905,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5004.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227085138},{"amount":109.82,"local_amount":5108,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5211.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232846801},{"amount":112.98,"local_amount":5255,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5361.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238661831},{"amount":118.51,"local_amount":5512,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5623.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244615976},{"amount":252.67,"local_amount":11752,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-18T09:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":11990.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250831152}],"funded_date":"2011-03-20T19:34:43Z","paid_date":"2012-01-18T09:06:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":286878,"name":"Mhamad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mhamad is a 33-year-old man, married with no children, working as a car painter.
