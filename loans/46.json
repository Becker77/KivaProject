They have five children. Three are adults and two are still under their care. He lives in his own house that belongs in the YTUMI company of the city of CAACUPE, where he has his business. The business started more than 20 years ago when they married. They saw an opportunity in the place where they live and with time they expanded to other areas.    \r\n\r\nThe family makes chipas [a traditional cheese bread] to sell. They also possess a stall where he obtains milk for resale, and he buys coconut to resell to companies that produce soap and coconut oil.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is asking for will be invested in the purchase of raw materials to make chipas (starch, cheese, vegetable shortening) and to purchase coconut. Florentino wants to grow his business day by day in order to increase his family income and give his whole family a dignified life.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":526959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sporting Good Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase starch, cheese and coconut.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Caacupe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.383333 -57.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-04-20T11:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florentino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":5670000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":321557},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":352109},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":443959},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":455603},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":467552},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":479815},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":492399},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":505314},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":518567},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":532167},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":546125},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":554833}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.05},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.52},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.96},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.95},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.21},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.95},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.62},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.59},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.05,"local_amount":321557,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:21:01Z","rounded_local_amount":321577.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144714614},{"amount":74.52,"local_amount":352109,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:48:26Z","rounded_local_amount":352131.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151898126},{"amount":93.96,"local_amount":443959,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":443987.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159638373},{"amount":96.43,"local_amount":455603,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":455631.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166852423},{"amount":98.95,"local_amount":467552,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":467581.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172119220},{"amount":101.55,"local_amount":479815,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":479845.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177413228},{"amount":666.54,"local_amount":3149405,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3149603.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182552907}],"funded_date":"2010-05-17T01:03:53Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:12:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":198413,"name":"Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"U.

She is unmarried and in 2008, she established  her grocery store business.  Working 7 days a week and 8 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid 4 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to purchase grocery goods for her shop.  In the future, Dipa plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

His wife has given him a son, now aged 3. Francisco's business for the past four years has been the sale of lubricants. He started the business with loans from a micro financing institution. The sales sometimes are slow given the great competition in the market. Because the interest rates of other institutions were so high, he opted to go with Afodenic because the interest rates are lower. This will be his third loan and with the funds he will purchase more lubricant products to replenish his inventory. This will improve his sales, as well as his income. In the long term he plans to install a car port were he will be able to do oil changes and provide other services as well. He will help his children complete their schooling and he also dreams of purchasing his own home. They currently live in his mother's house.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":226583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase lubricants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-11-19T12:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco Javier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:58:02Z","rounded_local_amount":934.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893516},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":934.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816604},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:17:33Z","rounded_local_amount":934.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351296},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":934.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038625},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":934.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928924},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":934.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383849},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":934.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890325},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":934.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111642},{"amount":47.24,"local_amount":888.88,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":934.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533072}],"funded_date":"2008-11-22T02:32:55Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T09:38:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":78768,"name":"Cleris","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cleris tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre dos ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os, vive junto a su esposo que la ayuda en todo y est\u00e1 de acuerdo con sus decisiones para la mejora de su negocio.

He has dedicated himself to brick making for the last 5 years. At first, he worked for other people as a day labourer, gaining the dexterity and experience needed to make bricks. Then, he and his brother decided to rent a plot of land with good soil for making clay and begin their own brick factory.  So far, they are doing very well, thanks to the high demand for bricks in their neighbourhood. Antonio involves himself in making the bricks and as well, he has hired some other labourers to help with the work. Now he would like to stock up on supplies for the start of summer - in march and april - when the climatic conditions are the best for brick making. This is the first loan Antonio will be receiving from MFP and he very much wants to work hard for the good of his communal bank, and intends to make his payments punctually. The money he is requesting will be invested into his factory. It will help pay the labourers' salaries and will be used to buy fuel for the brick baking oven.

She lives in the Manano Loma neighborhood.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Blanca is 41 years old, married, and has 8 children ages: 21, 19, 16, 15, 13, 10, 8, 3. Her 4 oldest children take classes online and work Monday through Friday as employees in an hacienda.  Her three youngest children are students in Cumbe\u2019s elementary school.  She has been separated from her husband for 6 six years because he was no good.  He was abusive and left them and doesn\u2019t pay child support.  In spite of this, Mar\u00eda Blanca is happy at home because she is surrounded by her family.  She has become both mother and father to her children.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Blanca takes care of the house and raises animals like guinea pigs, chickens, and sheep.

These loans have helped her buy animals and helped to her to find economic stability.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with the foundation and she tells us that what she likes best is the low rate of interest Espoir charges.  This helps her make her payments.  She also likes the trainings on health, investing, etc.  Above all, she likes the atmosphere of her communal bank because the members are friendly and everyone gets along because they have become good friends who support each other through thick and thin.  \r\n\r\nShe plans to invest her loan money in the purchase of chickens, guinea pigs, and pigs plus animal feel and vitamins to help them grow.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Blanca hopes to be able to give her children good educations and wants them to become professionals in the fields of their choice.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

After working in a supermarket in his town and getting the needed experience, he opened a mini market in addition to preparing a corner to sell vegetables and fruit. He\u2019s been operating his business since 2008. His shop is situated in a busy area so he was able to win over a good number of customers among those passing by his grocery shop during those two years. He\u2019s thankful for his decision because he\u2019s able to be supportive to his father and help him with some responsibilities despite his young age. Today, he is requesting to borrow US$ 1,200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to increase his shop inventory. Note that this is his second loan.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

Every day, very early in the morning, Joel goes out to work his fields.  For him, there is no day of rest, as he has to work his crops continually in order for them to yield well.  The main crops that he plants are cacao, coffee, and coca leaves, which he sells at wholesale in the city of San Francisco.  \r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys most about his work is the freedom that he has working the land.

This neighborhood is one of the most populated and more traditional areas of Barranquilla, where the first airport in the country is located.  Fredy is also an industrial electrician and offers his services to earn additional income.  \r\n<p>\r\nAt the moment, he is requesting a loan for multiple purposes.  He hopes to buy a freezer to replace the one he currently has because it has not been functioning lately.  Fredy will also buy beverages in bulk and add chicken and cold cuts to his business.  His financial records are in line with his business activity.  Fredy's purchases are made with cash and he maintains a gross profit margin of 34.19%.  His family expenses with respect to his operating profit represent 75.63%.  Fredy\u2019s accounts receivable are minimal since he has three customers who are pensioners and settle their bills at the end of the month.  His dreams are for his family to improve their well-being each day and to see his children become successful at whatever they pursue.  They serve as the motivation behind his work.

Carmen gets up very early and, together with her partner, goes to their farms to take care of their cacao and annatto plants, since these are their only means of support.  What she likes most about her work is seeing her plants grow on a daily basis and waiting for the harvest.  She has been doing this for 10 years and she thinks the most difficult part of it is not being able to fight the plagues of insects that damage her crops.  With this loan, she will be able to buy fruit plants to plant on her land and later harvest and sell, as she has seen that this is very profitable.  This will be her third loan with MFP and she is good about making her payments on time since she wants to take out more loans afterward.  She will use the 2,000 nuevos soles to buy fruit plants, such as orange, pineapple, and pacay, among others.

Since her husband is most often away, she does not have the financial security she needs.  If she need to pay for something, but he is away, she and her family are left stranded.

That is the way she did it, she saved some money and bought several standing fans and began to sell them. Now she has several clients and she keeps looking for more so that she will earn more money.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more clothes in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T08:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Regina C.

She is a seamstress and sells assorted clothing, shoes, sandals.  Also, a few years ago, she formed a dance troupe with her nieces and nephews and they perform wherever they are invited.  She makes all the costumes for the dances and, with each performance's earnings, she shares part with each dance troupe member and part she uses to buy more fabric or whatever else is needed.  She buys fabric, clothing, shoes, buttons, hair accessories at the east market which she then sells for cash or credit.  She distributes to the bank's offices and to her customers.  Of her three children, only a 16-year-old, who is a secondary school student, is still under her care.  The idea here is to help her husband with basic household expenses like utilities since he works as a driver and his salary is low.  With this financing she will buy building materials such as stone, sand and iron to begin to build a room and little by little finish it since materials are very expensive.

Tajikistan has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She thanks you for your support.   \r\n\r\nNepal has a long and rich history of traditional handicrafts.  Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity. Terracotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills. Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand-tool finishing. In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone. With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume. This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time, while increasing her profit margin.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

a barber shop. Yousef has been a barber for four years now. He wants to purchase creams and hair products to attract more customers so he took out the loan from FATEN, expecting to improve his financial situation.\r\n\r\nYousef appears in the picture here in the barber shop.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He is then able to offer them for sale at the various markets in the area, obtaining good earnings so that he can cover his family's expenses. \r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 1200 Peruvian new soles, to buy more animals and the appropriate feed for them. With the earnings he obtains from selling his animals, he will be able to pay off his loan while also providing his family with a better quality of life. Rosario is a person who has found ways to help his family get ahead, with much effort and dedication.

Ya no viven con ella, pero la visitan muy seguido. La actividad que realiza Juana es la venta de abarrotes y gaseosas, para eso abri\u00f3 en su propia casa una bodega y fuente de soda, en donde atiende a  sus clientes, inici\u00e1ndose con un capital propio y los cr\u00e9ditos recibidos de sus proveedores desde hace 30 a\u00f1os, logrando hacer crecer su negocio a base de esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n, encarg\u00e1ndose sola a la atenci\u00f3n de sus clientes ya que su esposo realiza viajes por su trabajo.Lo que le gusta de su actividad es que con el fruto de sus ganancias logr\u00f3 apoyar a su pareja que es operador de maquinaria pesada, a brindarle una mejor calidad de vida  y educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos que son su orgullo, adem\u00e1s de sentirse una mujer productiva y estar ocupada. Por lo contrario, lo que no le gusta es que algunos de sus clientes  le piden cr\u00e9ditos, a lo que ella se niega porque ya tuvo malas experiencias con ese tema, y viendo que tiene una regular cliente, considera que no es necesario incursionar en ese tipo de venta. Por otra parte, comenta que no tiene muchos gastos en su hogar, por eso solo tiene planes de mantener su negocio.

She is also very cheerful and sociable.  She is married to Jairo and the couple have five children who are now adults and have their own families.  They no longer live with Juana but visit her very often.  \r\n\r\nJuana's business is selling groceries and soda.  She opened a grocery store and small diner in her home where she serves her customers.  She started out with her own capital and some loans from her suppliers 30 years ago.  She managed to grow her business through her hard work and commitment.  She serves her customers on her own as her husband travels a lot with his work.  What Juana likes about her business is that the profits she makes have enabled her to support her husband, who is a heavy machinery operator.  She has also provided her children, who are her pride and joy, with a better quality of life and an education.  She also feels like a productive woman and enjoys being busy.  On the contrary, what Juana does not like about her work is that some of her customers ask to buy on credit which she does not allow because she has had bad experiences with this.  As she has a regular customer base, she sees no reason to provide this kind of service.  Juana tells us that she does not have many household expenses and so her only plans are to keep her business running.\r\n\r\nThis will be Juana's fifth loan from MFP.  She feels comfortable and happy with the financial support that she receives which allows her to make progress in her business.  For this reason, she pledges to make her repayments on time as she has with her previous loans.  Juana feels happy to be a member of her community bank as she considers them all to be responsible and supportive people.  She will use the sum of 2,000 soles that she has requested to invest in buying merchandise, such as general products, wholesale.  She will also buy sodas at more affordable prices.  This will allow her to enjoy a better profit margin."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":927831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a variety of products, and soda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":302.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":312.21},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":327.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":340.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":352.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":365.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.41},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":230.49,"local_amount":614.63,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":622.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836187},{"amount":122.63,"local_amount":327.01,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":331.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245950},{"amount":127.53,"local_amount":340.08,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":344.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385974},{"amount":132.27,"local_amount":352.72,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:56Z","rounded_local_amount":357.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099063},{"amount":137.08,"local_amount":365.56,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":370.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713211}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T19:14:30Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":366485,"name":"Felicita Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Perfil del Cliente \tEn el municipio de Quezalguaque en Le\u00f3n, la se\u00f1ora Felicita se ha desempe\u00f1ado como maestra de primaria desde hace 25 a\u00f1os habiendo adquirido much\u00edsima experiencia en este trabajo ya que le apasiona mucho ense\u00f1ar a los ni\u00f1os.

She wants to proceed with these improvements, so she made the decision to approach CEPRODEL and request a loan to buy construction materials such as cement, paint, rollers, sand, as well as pay for labor and transportation costs.  Her dream is to have a beautiful house, so her goal is to get the construction work started.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe will start the improvements to her house by plastering and painting.  This will spruce up her house and give it a better condition and appearance.  In addition to living there, Felicita\u2019s home is also a productive place since she also has store to generate additional income.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":935685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to pay for materials, labor, and transportation costs associated with her home improvements.

She also wants to purchase a motokar to provide mototaxi service, as well as facilitate her transportation to buy and sell chickens. \r\n\r\nVictoria is 38 years old, lives with her husband and their last two sons (three are already living independently). She is very hardworking, and her goal is to buy land to build a house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carrie Ting, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":206197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juanjui - San Martin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-7.183333 -76.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-07T21:00:50Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-22T04:04:37Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":334.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5330937},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:52:45Z","rounded_local_amount":334.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951307},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":334.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224334},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":334.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417066},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":334.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27110741},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":334.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006141}],"funded_date":"2008-10-08T04:04:37Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:18:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carolyn Ting","image":653228}},{"id":70608,"name":"Mame Diarra","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"MAME DIARRA S.

He is a farmer from Kisii town in Western Kenya. He has been farming for over eight years and his main products are milk, maize and tomatoes, which he sells to the local market. He relies solely on his farming activities to cater for his needs.\r\n<br>E. has a good record with Kiva partner, Juhudi Kilimo, after successfully completing his loan of 30,000 KES. He has requested this loan from Juhudi for 50,000 KES to purchase a dairy cow. Through this loan, he will be able to increase his sources of income through the sale of milk.

Her husband Jomarie, who is 44 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have four children who are 2 to 13 years old. \r\n\r\nElena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock to sell in her coffee shop and food-vending businesses so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and save up for future emergencies. Elena E. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

M. is a 27 year-old man who is married with one child. He lives on the outskirts of Nairobi in a town called Mlolongo. He has no other dependents. In the year 2005, he was employed by a Property Management Company. His employment there didn\u2019t last for long; unfortunately, the company collapsed and George had nothing else to do other than to go home. With the salary that he was earning, George had managed to save Ksh 20000 (USD 286) which he used to start a barbershop business. He used the money to buy a shaving machine. \r\n<p>\r\nAfter some time, he noticed that people had a problem communicating since not everybody owned a mobile phone. With the earnings that he made, he bought a community phone in order to curb this situation. The business thrived, but, due to a lack of funds to support the business, it almost collapsed. He used his own talents and skills of patience and hard work and started repairing spoiled mobile phones, selling blank CD\u2019s and selling scratch cards. After a period of six months, his business started booming and customers started flowing into his shop. The problems that George faced after losing his job made him innovative.\r\n<p>\r\nGeorge now wants to expand his business and wants to buy two shaving machines, one smoother, and also a photocopying machine. The total amount is $450. He believes that, if this loan is given to him, he will be able to boost his business and attract more customers. From the increase in profits, he will be able to better provide for his family and educate his child.\r\n<p>\r\nThe repayment period for his loan will be 8 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":90066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber Shop","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase two shaving machines, one smoother, and a second-hand photocopying machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Mlolongo settlement","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-12-02T11:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-16T16:54:06Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57,"local_amount":3546.67,"processed_date":"2008-01-10T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-10T09:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3664.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":113190},{"amount":57,"local_amount":3546.67,"processed_date":"2008-02-10T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-10T09:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3664.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":132593},{"amount":57,"local_amount":3546.67,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-10T09:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3664.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":154530},{"amount":57,"local_amount":3546.67,"processed_date":"2008-04-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-10T09:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3664.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":178729},{"amount":57,"local_amount":3546.67,"processed_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-10T09:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3664.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206278},{"amount":57,"local_amount":3546.67,"processed_date":"2008-06-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-10T09:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3664.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":234116},{"amount":57,"local_amount":3546.67,"processed_date":"2008-07-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-10T09:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3664.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":262886},{"amount":51,"local_amount":3173.33,"processed_date":"2008-08-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-10T09:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3278.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":291768}],"funded_date":"2007-12-02T16:54:06Z","paid_date":"2008-08-10T09:10:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":29641,"name":"Umed","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"Umed S. is 22 years old, has a high school education and is a bachelor.

Lissikatou H., 28, is married and the mother of three children, of whom two are enrolled in school. She is married to Ernest Fanou, a trained cook who lost his job two years ago. Mrs. Lissikatou H. has lived for 25 years in Xwlacodji, a densely populated neighborhood of Cotonou. For the past 8 years, she sold foodstuffs, especially corn. In view of the evolution of her business, she felt the need to take out a loan. At the beginning of 2008, her daughter Florence had some health problems that caused Mrs. H. to spend all her business capital to save her daughter's life. Despite this very unfortunate situation, she fully reimbursed her last loan. To get her business up and running again, she is again asking for a loan in the amount of US$ 250 to be used for a new project, namely selling cooked food which should be  more lucrative because of the current crisis in the food supply.<P><B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>Dame H.

Lim\u00f3n, located near the hot and humid Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. The formation of this group was inspired by the positive experience of one of its members as part of another group with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. The name of this group, 'Camino Al Sol', which translates as 'The Path of the Sun', has special significance to the members. The rising sun symbolizes the start of the work day and the rays it gives off illuminate the path for the members to follow. All the members of this group are motivated to improve their standard of living for themselves, their family and community. \r\n\r\nFor many members of this group, the use of their land is central to their productive activities. These are:  harvesting plantains, rearing and selling animals (chickens, pigs), and the management of a small store.  Other activities include the sale of propane gas, as well as clothing and cosmetic sales. This loan will be used by each woman to invest in her business at her discretion.  The women of this group have developed close personal relationships; they are a mix of neighbors and family members. This will be their first loan as a group with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. \r\n\r\nAugustina is a 32-year-old mother of four who lives with her husband and children; she is also the elected president of this group. Augustina owns and runs a small store from her home in Talamanca. This loan will be used to invest in the expansion of her store. She says that half of her income is gained at the store while she earns the other half by harvesting plantains. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this loan will be used increase her store inventory levels in basic products such as lard, butter and rice. For Augustina, the work day starts at 7AM and ends at 4PM; the whole family contributes when it comes to carrying out the responsibilities of running the business.  Augustina\u00b4s goal is to be able to earn more income in order to re-invest in her store's operations. Her goal is to be able to offer her clients higher quality and more diverse products. She also hopes to improve her ability to support the studies of her children financially by optimizing the success of her business.  \r\n\r\nAugustina says her only obstacle is the lack of working capital she needs in order to make improvements to her store. This loan will help her to overcome this obstacle. Augustina says there are advantages to the group lending methodology, as compared to the individual method, \u00a8If we\u00b4re united there is better support and communication. It makes the credit more solid.\u00a8\r\n\r\nXinia plans to use this loan to purchase tanks of propane gas. She buys tanks for 8500 colones and sells them for 10,000. With this loan, she should be able to purchase 11 tanks and earn 16,500 colones profit (US$ 30).  \r\n\r\nAndreina, Rosibel, and Regina will use this loan to finance the purchase of catalogue products. These group members spend their days travelling in their communities, looking for clients to offer their products to (colognes, clothing, kitchen appliances, and cleaners, among other products). After collecting orders, the women travel to a central location to purchase the requested items from the catalogue company. Since they are paid upon delivery of the requested products, women who make sales in this way often lack the initial capital to make their first purchase.  This loan will be used to finance the purchase of ordered products and enable the women to return to their communities with inventory for sale. \r\n\r\nLidieth, Liveth and Josefa are involved in animal rearing. These group members will use their loan to invest in the purchase of livestock (pigs and chickens) as well as animal feed and nutrients to keep the animals healthy. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":527134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"basic products such as lard, butter and rice, etc. for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Lim\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-04-20T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Xinia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andre\u00edna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosibel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidieth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liveth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maryorie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":143872.3},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":146270.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":148708.01},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":151186.47},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":153706.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":156256.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":259.77},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.1},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.97},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.53},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":282.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":259.81,"local_amount":143895,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":144350.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712589},{"amount":264.14,"local_amount":146293.25,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":146755.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152047948},{"amount":268.54,"local_amount":148731.47,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":149201.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159763258},{"amount":273.02,"local_amount":151210.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":151688.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850743},{"amount":283.01,"local_amount":156741.57,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":157237.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172258682},{"amount":276.48,"local_amount":153128.38,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":153612.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411554}],"funded_date":"2010-04-21T01:32:17Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":198477,"name":"Jacob","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacob is into two businesses and his business has really been flourishing.

Z. is a 35 year old woman who lives with her husband and children in the small town of La Garita in Guanacaste.  La Garita is situated on a plain that experiences very warm climate.  The main business activities are livestock breeding, agriculture, and rural tourism.\r\n<p>\r\nFor several years, Norgui has been raising chickens for fattening and egg production.  She sells her products to neighbors in the community who have expressed their satisfaction.  Norgui says she has the support of her husband, which makes it easier for her to continue with this activity.  She also says her work is very interesting because she has seen business grow little by little and demand get stronger.\r\n<p>\r\nAt the moment, Do\u00f1a Norgui is requesting a microloan of 500,000 CRC in order to buy more chickens and hens, concentrated feed, and products for treating illness.  This will help her expand and strengthen her business.  She hopes the increased growth in her business will improve her quality of life.  Currently her business is doing well, but she lacks the money to make it grow even more.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Norgui is a member of the Communal Credit Enterprise of La Garita, one of 100 member organizations that form EDESA in Costa Rica.  This is her first loan, so she hopes to continue participating as an active member within this type of organization.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

To earn his living he sells food, such as barbequed steak, pork chops, roast plantains and a delicious vegetable salad which his customers love. He sells these delicious dishes from a cart all over the city, working 5 hours every afternoon from 2pm till 7pm. In this way he has been able to bring up his children. This loan is to buy beef, pork, vegetables, plantains and other items necessary for his business.

This is 22-year-old Jeni M. M. from Kyela. She is married with one two-year-old child. Jeni has been running a tailoring business since 2004. She works at the business for 5 to 8 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Jeni currently earns about 275 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 700 USD in order to purchase wool and other materials used for making clothes. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and range materials in bulk. Jeni thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":237324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase wool and other materials used for making clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-14T07:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeni M.

Since she was very young, doing craftwork has given her pleasure and while she learned to do them she also got involved in making clothing. Later she specialized in being a tailor, since she considered this activity to be very beautiful because of the elegance of the dresses that she made. She has been practicing this trade for twenty years in her own home, taking notice that the requests have always been increasing in number due to the quality of her work. In her business, the profitability is based on the high prices that she charges, due to the quality of the fabrics with which she works and the finishing job that she does.

This is her ninth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and in these five years she has worked with much care to benefit her community bank.

He lives in his own house.  Since he was very young he has grown oranges, coffee, and bananas.  Of all of his crops, the most profitable has been coffee.  There were times when the majority of the farmers did not harvest good coffee, but he did.  Therefore, he was able to sell it at a very good price.\r\n\r\nThese earnings served him to buy his land and build a house in the city of Lima.  However, upon separating from his wife, he returned to his rural house in his village.  He concentrated his efforts on his coffee crops.  Even though he is, at times, not very strong, Lorenzo has a great desire to continue growing his products.  He has the help of some workers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
